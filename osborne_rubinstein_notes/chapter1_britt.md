- Discussion between David Reinstein and Britt Li, possibly others

## Chapter 1

### 1.1	Preferences 
 

A binary relation on a set $X$ specifies, for each ordered pair $(x , y )$ of members of X , whether or not x relates to y in a certain way. For example, “acquaintance” is a binary relation on a set of people. For some pairs (x , y ) of people, the state- ment “x is acquainted with y ” is true, and for some pairs it is false. Another example of a binary relation is “smaller than” on the set of numbers. For some pairs (x,y ) of numbers, x is smaller than y , and for some it is not. For a binary relation R, the expression x R y means that x is related to y according to R. For any pair (x , y ) of members of X , the statement x R y either holds or does not hold. For example, for the binary relation < on the set of numbers, we have 3 < 5, but not7<1.

**Britt questions:**

-	Not sure the meaning of ‘binary relation’. Does it refer to relationships between two objects?
-	What does ‘acquaintance’ example mean? 
-	Given that R stands for relation, what does xRy means? Does it mean the relationship between x and y? If so, what does yRx mean?


-	I am still confused with the concept of ‘reflexivity’ after reading these paragraphs. Does it mean all ‘x’ are the same?
