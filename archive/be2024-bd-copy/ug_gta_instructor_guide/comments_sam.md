# Comments for Sam:

Good clear handwriting and drawing (unlike me)

Good that you went around to see people's work, but it's not clear that they knew to bring work

You don't need to plot *all* of the points

May be better to print out the problem set (with notes to instructor). But it was also good that you projected the question on the board.

You may be able to get students to *tell* slope calculation ... engage them

Maybe the algebra of the lines was going on too long without involving the students? Try to ask the students a question, or to do something along with you, or for a volunteer every 3-4 minutes I guess.

I realize this was a challenge because it was such a large group in your section (unlike my 8:30am section)
