## Submitted abstract

Little giving to the most effective charities 
'Innumerate empathy': key barrier to promoting effective giving?

- Previous: emotional reactions to suffering $\rightarrow$ helping; but this "doesn't scale" with need (need $\neq$ effectiveness)

- Dual process: *analytical* impact info may disrupt empathic giving

*Our six giving experiments, in various contexts*

- 2x2, between-subject treatments
  - Measures of charity efficiency/effectiveness
  - Empathy-inducing images

*Results:*

Analytical info doesn't seem to disrupt empathic giving (but some lack of power), and may enhance it. 
The 'right' empathic images can drive effective giving.

  
<aside class="notes">

A small share of charitable giving goes towards “highly-effective” charities as measured by GiveWell (or to charities in this category: health interventions in poor countries).
*Innumerate empathy* may constitute a major barrier to (promoting) effective giving.

Previous work finds that helping behaviors are strongly driven by emotional reactions to individual suffering, but these do not scale with the magnitude of need. From a dual-process perspective, presenting analytical impact information may even disrupt empathic giving, shifting potential donors towards a system-II deliberative mode. We report on six charitable giving experiments. Treatments (between subjects, mainly 2x2) present (i) measures of charity efficiency/effectiveness and (ii) empathy-inducing images. Variations across experiments include: subject pools (MTurk, UK students, US regular donors via direct mail),  separate vs. joint evaluation, the nature of the effectiveness information, and treatment ordering/timing.

## Definition {#def-impact}

*Impact* aka *effectiveness* of a charity

$B(G_i)$: Beneficial *outcome* achieved by charity $i$ with total donations $G_i$

<br> 

- *Ultimate outcome* --  Lives saved, QALY added, etc.

- Not *'output'* -- 'nets provided' nor 'paintings purchased'

<aside class="notes">

(Total or marginal) impact per dollar = output per dollar $\times$ impact per output

*Impact* of a donation:  

$B'(G_i)$ for the marginal donor

- GiveWell and others attempt to measure this

<br> 

<center>

*We know:*

$B'(G_i)$  is much larger for most *impactful* vs. most *popular* charities.

2. Identity:  Things that run against one's self-perception and how one believes others will will see you. (e.g., signaling emotional empathy; avoiding cognitive dissonance from previous ineffective giving)

3. Inertia and systemic/institutional "Factors limiting individual & social *change* in behavior

4.  Quantitative biases	: Problems dealing with numbers and making logical evaluations involving numbers, values and amounts. Common cognitive errors *or* intuitive and emotional reactions triggered in these contexts. (E.g., Overhead aversion; Proportional dominance)

<aside class="notes">
Spontaneous Emotions and Deliberation: Dual-Process Perspectives

What happens when we combine emotional and reasoning appeals?

Some research suggest that people withhold donations when they engage in deliberate thinking (Small et al., 2007). 

Dual process models of prosocial behaviors:

Also see Fisk relation models theory 

Alternate channel: Exley, Motivated reasoning: ` ...if participants
desire to keep money for themselves and to think of themselves as generous, they may overweight
their dislike of less-than-perfect performance metrics as an excuse not to give.'

# Prior evidence and gaps {#prior-evidence}

## Identifiable victims effect/ deservingness vs deliberation

<br> 

Claim: Better to portray an individual (child) than convey the total affected <small> Small & Loewenstein (03); Small et al (07); Kogut & R (05) </small>

- Driven by System-1 empathy, switched off by analytic thinking

***

**Small et al (2007):** 

<br>

[Study 3] "individuals who faced an identifiable victim donated more..."

<br>

> - "...than those who faced victim statistics, p < .01,"

<br>

> - ..."than those who faced [both] an identifiable victim [and] statistics, p < .05.""

*** 

**Small et al, '07, Study 4**

<br> 

> Priming analytic thinking reduced donations to an identifiable victim relative to a feeling-based thinking prime.

<br>

> Yet, the primes had no distinct effect on donations to statistical victims, which is symptomatic of the difficulty in generating feelings for these victims.

<br>

<center> <small> `r format_with_col("*Tightly bounded null, but ... nonlinearity?*","blue")` </small> </center>

<aside class="notes">

Note, the latter non-effect appears tightly bounded; but this could simply be driven by nonlinearity. If people gave little to statistical victims, there is less room for this to decrease further. A classic problem when considering interactions.

**Details of Karlan first wave: SCIENCE vs EMOTION**


> According to studies on our programs in Peru that used rigorous scientific methodologies, women who have received both loans and business education saw their profits grow, even when compared to women who just received loans for their businesses. But the real difference comes when times are slow. The study showed that women in Freedom from Hunger's Credit with Education program kept their profits strong–ensuring that their families would not suffer, but thrive.

<br> 

> Because of caring people like you, Freedom from Hunger was able to offer Sebastiana a self-help path toward achieving her dream of getting “a little land to farm” and pass down to her children. As Sebastiana's young son, Aurelio, runs up to hug her, she says, “I do whatever I can for my children.”


## Information as an 'excuse' not to give; allows motivated reasoning

<br> 

**Fong & O, '10:**

> "Dictators [charitable giving] who acquire information mostly use it to withhold resources from less-preferred types, leading to a drastic decline in aggregate transfers"

<br> 

<aside class="notes">
Exley issues: Experimenter demand (M-turk focus), not really 'impact' information
Fong: Selection effects. In their tables, exogenous provision of information seems to *increase* donations overall.
Also ... it's evidence on the deservingness of the recipients, not on impact of a charity itself.

**Metzger & G, '19 **

Lab donations to high/low-performing NGO

- More purchasing of 'recipient type' than 'impact' info

- Mixed & weak evidence on excuse-driven information-seeking

<br> 

<center>`r format_with_col("Caveats...","blue")` </center>

<aside class="notes">
 
Opportunity to buy info on 'recipient type' increased giving, on 'admin costs' decreased giving (marginal significance for both), no effect of 'aid impact' but wide CI 

'Free info' on each of these had insignificant effects (underpowered!) 

Lots of caveats; e.g., recipient type (artists vs children) may have been seen as a proxy for impact

</aside> 

<!--
In a laboratory experiment, we analyze individuals’ demand for information about a donation’s welfare impact, and compare it with demand for information on recipient types and administrative costs. We find the least demand for information about aid impact, indicating that individuals either do not understand, do not trust, or do not care about the specific information we provide. Average donations increase in response to information about the recipient type and decrease in response to information about administrative costs. Information about aid impact does not significantly change average donations: donors who demand information respond positively to high impact projects and negatively to low impact projects, resulting in a zero net effect on donation levels. Our results further show that information has the same effect on donation behavior regardless of whether it is provided for free or at a cost.
-->

<!-- "Making an impact? The relevance of information on aid effectiveness for charitable giving. A laboratory experiment.":

>...the demand for information about aid impact is lowest, and it is highest for information about the recipient type.

> ... exact information about aid impact did not lead to a significant change in average donation levels, while information about the exact recipient type and administrative costs led to a significant change in donation levels.

> In the recipient type group, informed participants donated significantly more than uninformed participants because they "rewarded" the preferred recipient with higher-than-average transfers. In the administration costs group, informed participants donated significantly less than uninformed participants because they used the information to "punish" NGOs with high administration costs.

DR: It is not clear to me when they are reporting on the self-selected groups and when they report on the sample overall, or in a way that deals with the self-selection.

Looking at their one clearer result, we see a lack of power.

Average don:    2.45 CHF

Aid impact group coef: -.231 (.45)

This looks like an underpowered study. They can perhaps rule out an effect greater than around half of the average donation, but no more precisely.

## Our empirical approach {#empirical-approach}


- Naturalistic environments

- Robustness across setups/frames

- Honest presentation of evidence, allowing integration

<aside class="notes">
This is a project and not just a (set of) papers. 
The general project is a practical one (although Bergh's project aims to explore into specific mechanisms).
By measuring the impact of several types of efficiency information, across several contexts, we aim to produce a fairly robust picture. We expect heterogeneity and sensitivity to frames; thus results may vary, and we will carefully examine the overall picture as well as  this variation in a 'mini-meta-analysis'.
To limit various types of experimenter demand and arbitrary coherence, these experiments are *between* participant, and (largely) run in contexts where the donation is not the focus of the interaction.
We have preregistered our studies, hypotheses and analyses.
We will share all of our data to enable future reanalyses.

</small>

## Plans from prereg: 

> What is the impact of including 'information about the per-dollar impact'  of a charity (in terms of services provided) on the average donation (equivalently, total amount raised) and the donation incidence rate?

***

> We are running this subject to the final say of the charity. We have proposed that the Treatment emails (but not the control emails) will include a sentence/fragment such as the following in both a captioned photo in the email, and the email text:

> "Last year, we were able to provide [general provision of an outcome here relevant to the charity] to a [recipient unit] with just $[small amount of money]."

***

<center> (from prereg) </center>

> We plan to perform standard nonparametric statistical tests of the effect of this treatment on

- Average gift amount (including zeroes)
- Incidence/number of people making a gift, [and]
- Incidence of gifts of exactly $10.

>  In particular, we will focus on Fisher's exact test (for incidence) and the standard rank sum and t-tests for the donation amounts.

***

**Power calculations**

> Response rates in previous such emails were extremely low: approximately 1 per 3,000 emails. Our power calculations suggest that we have .29 power to detect a 50% effect, and 0.90 power to detect approximately a 100% (doubling) on incidence...

> Because of this limited power, we will ask the charity to run this trial a second time with an equivalent-sized sample.

***

**Stopping rule**

> We aim to continue this treatment in future charity appeals until we can statistically bound (with 95% confidence) the impact of the treatment on both incidence and average donation within a margin of 1/3 of the incidence and average donation in the control condition.  

## Context

*Charity:* A large US religiously-associated international poverty relief charity  

*Timing:* All emails sent out at the same time, 21-Nov-2018 'Thanksgiving email'

Sample size and composition: 

- Charity's standard email list (previous donors with emails) 
- Approx 182,600 emails sent out, 91.3k in each condition

**Cost (Impact/\$) information treatment $\rightarrow$**

1. Slightly lower rate of opened emails:  

- 16816/91298  (18.4%) in control vs 16105/91296 in treatment (17.6%)
- Highly significant in Fisher's exact test ($p<0.001$)

2. Slightly (insignificantly) lower rate of click-through after opening

- 2.3% vs 2.5% (95% OR: 0.81, 1.08)

**3. Greater donation incidence:**


*Via email click-through:* **66 > 25** 

- Highly significant in Fisher's exact test ($p<0.001$, 95% CI OR: (1.7, 4.5); (1.8,4.5) conditional on opening email)
  
  
<br>
  
*Next 7 days, all channels, for email-openers:* **267 > 241 **

- "Marginally insignificant" in Fisher's exact ($p=0.1$, 95\% CI OR: (0.97,1.39)
  
<aside class="notes">
Some intertemporal substitution?
But I'm not sure yet whether the latter is 'all modes' or 'modes other than the original email'.

```{r dv-histo, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

smalltext <- element_text(size = 7)

dv_hist_email <- dv_cross %>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(mode)) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x=range, y=gifts, fill=treatment), position = position_dodge(width=.5), width=.5) + facet_grid(mode ~ .)  + theme(axis.text.x = smalltext)


dv_hist_email_stack <- dv_cross %>%

4. **Mixed results on avg. donation (overall \& CoP), amount raised**


Average revenue/email:

*A. Via email clickthrough:*

- Trtmt \$0.07 per email; Ctrl \$0.16	per email (\$90.46 vs \$536.89 CoP)	

- Ranksum: insignificant overall, strongly significant (but probably misleading) for CoP (mean ranks 30.3 vs 47.0)

<aside class="notes">
The first result appears driven by a single donation outlier in the control group
</aside> 

<!--
Todo:  t-test, incidence of highest contributions, distribution shift?
-->

<br> 

*B. Next 7 days*

- Treatment \$0.48 per email vs Control \$0.34 

  - Difference seems driven by largest donations

<aside class="notes">

7 days \$43,448 raised (treatment)  vs \$30,931 (control), divided by number of emails *sent*

Which tests to use... noting mostly zeroes, great skew? Zero-inflated negative binomial? Hyperbolic sine transformed ols? Problem: no access to raw data, need to request.

Karlan Because there are outliers in the dependent variable, we use four methods to examine robustness to different functional forms: simple amount donated, amount donated winsorized at $1000 (which constitutes the 99.8th percentile), and the inverse hyperbolic sine of the amount donated (because log of amount donated would drop those who did not donate).
Note: if we can get 'last amount donated' this would be good.

5. Lack of power to detect relative rate of donations at/under \$10 (email responses)

<br> 

2/91298 in control

5/91296 in treatment 


```{r dv_don_ranges_fisher, results='hide', echo=FALSE}

dv_10don <-
matrix(c(100-2, 2, 91296-5, 5),
       nrow = 2, dimnames = list(control = c("no", "yes"), treat = c("no", "yes")))

(ft_dv_10don <- fisher.test(dv_10don, or=1, alternative="t", conf.int))

# Preliminary conclusions, future directions (time permitting) {#conclusion}

## Preliminary take-aways: Don't fear the info

1. "Images work"

<small> Image treatments can be effective at motivating giving, including *impactful, efficient* giving </small>

<br> 

2. "Info doesn't hurt, may help": 

<small> Analytic information about impact: 

Does not seem to (strongly) decrease donations 

May increase donations in some cases (CRS)

Mixed evidence on 'efficiency info dampening the impact of identified victim images'

$\rightarrow$ this may not be a 'major barrier' to promoting effective giving 

Caveats: More power needed, cannot rule out substantial effects </small>
  

## Future directions

- Followup with religious-affiliated charity 

- Integrate motivated reasoning/excuse-driven
