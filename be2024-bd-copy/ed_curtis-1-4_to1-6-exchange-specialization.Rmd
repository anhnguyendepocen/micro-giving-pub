\section{A model of exchange and specialization}\label{sec:ch1sec4}

We have two producers and two goods:  Amanda and Zoe produce vegetables ($V$) and or fish ($F$). Their production capabilities are defined in Table~\ref{table:pptwoperson} and in Figure~\ref{fig:absadvprod}, where the quantity of $V$ appears on the vertical axis and the quantity of $F$ on the horizontal axis. Zoe and Amanda each have 36-hour weeks and they devote that time to producing the two goods. But their efficiencies differ: Amanda requires two hours to produce a unit of $V$ and three hours for a unit of $F$. As a consequence, if she devotes all of her time to $V$ she can produce 18 units, or if she devotes all of her time to $F$ she can produce 12 units. Or, she could share her time between the two.

\begin{Table}{25em}{Production possibilities in a two-person economy \label{table:pptwoperson}}{Each producer has a time allocation of 36 hours. By allocating total time to one activity, Amanda can produce 12$F$ or 18$V$, Zoe can produce 18$F$ or 9$V$. By splitting their time each person can also produce a combination of the two.}

In Figure~\ref{fig:absadvprod} Amanda's capacity is represented by the line that meets the vertical axis at 18 and the horizontal axis at 12. The vertical point indicates that she can produce 18 units of $V$ if she produces zero units of $F$ -- keep in mind that where $V$ has a value of 18, Amanda has no time left for fish production. Likewise, if she devotes all of her time to fish she can produce 12 units, since each unit requires 3 of her 36 hours. The point $F = 12$ is thus another possibility for her. In addition to these two possibilities, which we can term `specialization', she could allocate her time to producing some of each good. For example, by dividing her 36 hours equally she could produce 6 units of $F$ and 9 units of $V$. A little computation will quickly convince us that different allocations of her time will lead to combinations of the two goods that lie along a straight line joining the specialization points. We will call this straight line Amanda's \terminology{production possibility frontier ($PPF$)}: it is the combination of goods she can produce while using all of her resources -- time. She could not produce combinations of goods represented by points beyond this line (to the top right). She could indeed produce combinations below it (lower left) -- for example a combination of 4 units of $V$ and 4 units of $F$; but such points would not require all of her time. The $(4,4)$ combination would require just 20 hours. In sum, points beyond this line are not feasible, and points within it do not require all of her time resources.

\begin{DefBox}
\textbf{Production possibility frontier ($PPF$)}: the combination of goods that can be produced using all of the resources available.
\end{DefBox}

Having developed Amanda's $PPF$, it is straightforward to develop a corresponding set of possibilities for Zoe. If she requires 4 hours to produce a unit of $V$ and 2 hours to produce a unit of $F$, then her 36 hours will enable her to specialize in 9 units of $V$ or 18 units of $F$; or she could produce a combination represented by the straight line that joins these two specialty extremes.

Consider now what we term the opportunity costs for each person. If Amanda, from a starting point of 18 $V$ and zero $F$, wishes to produce some $F$, and less $V$ she must sacrifice 1.5 units of $V$ for each unit of $F$ she decides to produce. This is because $F$ requires 50\% more hours than $V$. Her trade-off is 1.5:1.0, or equivalently 3:2. In the graphic, for every 3 units of $V$ she does not produce she can produce 2 units of $F$, reflecting the hours she must devote to each. Yet another way to see this is to recognize that if she stopped producing the 18 units of $V$ entirely, she could produce 12 units of $F$; and the ratio 18:12 is again 3:2. This then is her opportunity cost: the cost of an additional two units of $F$ is that 3 units of $V$ must be `sacrificed'.

Zoe's opportunity cost, by the same reasoning, is 1:2 --- 1 unit of $V$ for 2 units of $F$.

So we have established two things about Amanda and Zoe's production possibilities. First, if Amanda specializes in $V$ she can produce more than Zoe, just as Zoe can produce more than Amanda if Zoe specializes in $F$. Second, their opportunity costs are different: Amanda must sacrifice more $V$ than Zoe in producing one more unit of $F$.

To illustrate the gains from specialization and trade, let us initially suppose that Amanda and Zoe are completely self-sufficient (they consume exactly what they produce), and they each divide their production time equally between the two goods. Hence, Amanda produces and consumes 6$F$ and 9$V$, whereas Zoe's combination is 9$F$ and 4.5$V$. These combinations must lie on their respective $PPF$s and are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:absadvprod}.

Upon realizing that they are not equally efficient in producing the two goods, they decide to specialize completely in producing just the single good where they are most efficient. Amanda specializes in $V$ and Zoe in $F$. Right away we notice that this allocation of time will realize 18$V$ and 18$F$, which is more than the combined amounts they produce and consume when not specializing -- 15$F$ and 13.5$V$. Logic dictates that each should be able to consume more following specialization. What they must do however, is negotiate a rate at which to exchange $V$ for $F$. Since Amanda's opportunity cost is 3:2 and Zoe's is 1:2, perhaps they agree to exchange $V$ for $F$ at an intermediate rate of 2:2 (or 1:1, which is the same). With Amanda specializing in $V$ and Zoe in $F$ they now trade one unit of $V$ for one unit of $F$. Consider Figure~\ref{fig:absadvcon}.

% Figure 1.2
\input{figures/ch1/ch1fig2}

If Amanda can trade at a rate of 1:1 her consumption opportunities have improved dramatically: if she were to trade away all of her 18$V$, she would get 18 fish in return, whereas when consuming what she produced, she was limited to 12 fish. Suppose she wants to consume both $V$ and $F$ and she offers Zoe 8$V$. Clearly she will get 8$F$ in return, and she will consume ($8F + 10V$) -- more than she consumed prior to specializing.

By the same reasoning, after specializing in producing 18 fish, Zoe trades away 8$F$ and receives 8$V$ from Amanda in return. Therefore Zoe consumes ($10F + 8V$). The result is that \textit{they are now each consuming more than in the initial allocation. Specialization and trade have increased their consumption}.\footnote{In the situation we describe above one individual is absolutely more efficient in producing one of the goods and absolutely less efficient in the other. We will return to this model in Chapter~\ref{chap:internationaltrade} and illustrate that consumption gains of the type that arise here can also result if one of the individuals is absolutely more efficient in produce both goods, but that the degree of such advantage differs across goods.}


\section{Economy-wide production possibilities}\label{sec:ch1sec5}

The $PPF$s in Figure~\ref{fig:absadvprod} define the amounts of the goods that each \textit{individual} can produce while using all of their productive capacity---time in this instance. The national, or economy-wide, $PPF$ for this two-person economy reflects these individual possibilities combined. Such a frontier can be constructed using the individual frontiers as the component blocks.

First let us define this economy-wide frontier precisely. The \terminology{economy-wide $PPF$} is the set of goods combinations that can be produced in the economy when all available productive resources are in use. Figure~\ref{fig:econwideppf} contains both of the individual frontiers plus the aggregate of these, represented by the kinked line \textit{ace}. The point on the $V$ axis, a=27, represents the total amount of $V$ that could be produced if both individuals devoted all of their time to it. The point e=30 on the horizontal axis is the corresponding total for fish.

\begin{DefBox}
\textbf{Economy-wide $PPF$}: the set of goods combinations that can be produced in the economy when all available productive resources are in use.
\end{DefBox}

To understand the point c, imagine initially that all resources are devoted to $V$. From such a point, a, we consider a reduction in $V$ and an increase in $F$. The most efficient way of increasing $F$ production at the point a is to use the individual whose opportunity cost of $F$ is least -- Zoe. She can produce one unit of $F$ by sacrificing just 1/2 unit of $V$. Amanda on the other hand must sacrifice 1.5 units of $V$ to produce 1 unit of $F$. Hence, at this stage Amanda should stick to $V$ and Zoe should devote some time to fish. In fact as long as we want to produce more fish Zoe should be the one to do it, until she has exhausted her time, which occurs after she has produced 18$F$ and has ceased producing $V$. At this point the economy will be producing 18$V$ and 18$F$ -- the point c.

% Tikz ch1fig3
\input{figures/ch1/ch1fig3}

From this combination, if the economy wishes to produce more fish Amanda must become involved. Since her opportunity cost is 1.5 units of $V$ for each unit of $F$, the next segment of the economy-wide $PPF$ must see a reduction of 1.5 units of $V$ for each additional unit of $F$. This is reflected in the segment ce. When both producers allocate all of their time to $F$ the economy can produce 30 units. Hence the economy's $PPF$ is the two-segment line ace. Since this has an outward kink, we call it concave (rather than convex).

As a final step consider what this $PPF$ would resemble if the economy were composed of many persons with differing degrees of comparative advantage. A little imagination suggests (correctly) that it will have a segment for each individual and continue to have its outward concave form. Hence, a four-person economy in which each person had a different opportunity cost could be represented by the segmented line abcde, in Figure~\ref{fig:multipersonppf}. Furthermore, we could represent the $PPF$ of an economy with a very large number of such individuals by a somewhat smooth $PPF$ that accompanies the 4-person $PPF$. The logic for its shape continues to be the same: as we produce less $V$ and more $F$ we progressively bring into play resources, or individuals, whose opportunity cost, in terms of reduced $V$ is higher.

% Figure 1.4
\input{figures/ch1/ch1fig4}

The outputs $V$ and $F$ in our economic model require just one input -- time. But the argument for a concave $PPF$ where the economy uses machines, labour, land etc. to produce different products is the same. Furthermore, we generally interpret the $PPF$ to define the output possibilities \textit{when it is running at its normal capacity}. In this example, we consider a work week of 36 hours to be the `norm'. Yet it is still possible that the economy's producers might work some additional time in exceptional circumstances, and this would increase total production possibilities. This event would be represented by an outward movement of the $PPF$.

\section{Aggregate output, growth and business cycles}\label{sec:ch1sec6}

The $PPF$ can also be used to illustrate three aspects of macroeconomics: the level of a nation's output, the growth of national and per capita output over time, and short run business-cycle fluctuations in national output and employment.

\subsection*{Aggregate output}

An economy's capacity to produce goods and services depends on its endowment of resources and the productivity of those resources. The two-person, two-product examples in the previous section reflect this.

The \terminology{productivity of labour}, defined as output per worker or per hour, depends on:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Skill, knowledge and experience of the labour force;
\item  \terminology{Capital stock}: buildings, machinery, and equipment, and software the labour force has to work with; and
\item  Current technological trends in the labour force and the capital stock.
\end{itemize}

\begin{DefBox}
The \textbf{productivity of labour} is the output of goods and services per worker.

An economy's \textbf{capital stock} is the buildings, machinery, equipment and software used in producing goods and services.
\end{DefBox}

The economy's output, which we define by $Y$, can be defined as the output per worker times the number of workers; hence, we can write:

\begin{equation*}
Y=(\text{number of workers employed})\times(\text{output per worker}).
\end{equation*}

When the employment of labour corresponds to `full employment' in the sense that everyone willing to work at current wage rates and normal hours of work is working, the economy's actual output is also its capacity output $Y_c$. We also term this capacity output as \terminology{full employment output}:

\begin{DefBox}
\textbf{Full employment output} $Y_c=(\text{number of workers at full employment})\times(\text{output per worker})$.
\end{DefBox}

Suppose the economy is operating with full employment of resources producing outputs of two types: goods and services. In Figure~\ref{fig:growthandppf}, $PPF_0$ shows the different combinations of goods and services that the economy could produce in a particular year using all its labour, capital and the best technology available at the time.

An aggregate economy produces a large variety of outputs in two broad categories. Goods are the products of the agriculture, forestry, mining, manufacturing and construction industries.  Services are provided by the wholesale and retail trade, transportation, hospitality, finance, health care, legal and other service sectors.  As in the two-product examples used earlier, the shape of the $PPF$ illustrates the opportunity cost of increasing the output of either product type.

Point $X_0$ on $PPF_0$ shows one possible structure of capacity output. This combination may reflect the pattern of demand and hence expenditures in this economy.  Output structures differ among economies with different income levels. High-income economies spend more on services than goods and produce higher ratios of services to goods. Middle income countries produce lower ratios of services to goods, and low income countries much lower ratios of services to goods.  Different countries also have different $PPF$s and different output structures, depending on their labour forces, labour productivity and expenditure patterns.

\subsection*{Economic growth}

Three things contribute to growth in the economy. The labour supply grows as the population expands; the stock of capital grows as spending by business on new offices, factories, machinery and equipment expands; and labour-force productivity grows as a result of experience, the development of scientific knowledge combined with product and process innovations, and advances in the technology of production.  Combined, these developments expand capacity output. In Figure~\ref{fig:growthandppf} economic growth shifts the $PPF$ out from $PPF_0$ to $PPF_1$.

% Tikz ch1fig5
\input{figures/ch1/ch1fig5}

This basic description of economic growth covers the key sources of growth in total output. Economies differ in their rates of overall economic growth as a result of different rates of growth in labour force, in capital stock, and improvements in the technology. But improvements in standards of living require more than growth in total output. Increases in output \textit{per worker} and \textit{per person} are necessary.  Sustained increases in living standards require sustained growth in labour productivity based on advances in the technologies used in production.

\subsection*{Recessions and booms}

The objective of economic policy is to ensure that the economy operates on or near the $PPF$ -- it would use its resources to capacity and have minimal unemployment. However, economic conditions are seldom tranquil for long periods of time. Unpredictable changes in business expectations of future profits, in consumer confidence, in financial markets, in commodity and energy prices, in output and incomes in major trading partners, in government policy and many other events disrupt patterns of expenditure and output. Some of these changes disturb the level of total expenditure and thus the demand for total output. Others disturb the conditions of production and thus the economy's production capacity. Whatever the exact cause, the economy may be pushed off its current $PPF$. If expenditures on goods and services decline the economy may experience a \terminology{recession}. Output would fall short of capacity output and unemployment would rise. Alternatively, times of rapidly growing expenditure and output may result in an economic \terminology{boom}: output and employment expand beyond capacity levels.

\begin{DefBox}
An \textbf{economic recession} occurs when output falls below the economy's capacity output.

A \textbf{boom} is a period of high growth that raises output above normal capacity output.
\end{DefBox}

Recent history provides examples. Following the U.S financial crisis in 2008-09 many industrial countries were pushed into recessions. Expenditure on new residential construction collapsed for lack of income and secure financing, as did business investment, spending and exports. Lower expenditures reduced producers' revenues, forcing cuts in output and employment and reducing household incomes. Lower incomes led to further cutbacks in spending. In Canada in 2009 aggregate output declined by 2.9 percent, employment declined by 1.6 percent and the unemployment rate rose from 6.1 percent in 2008 to 8.3 percent. Although economic growth recovered, that growth had not been strong enough to restore the economy to capacity output at the end of 2011. The unemployment rate fell to 7.4 but did not return to its pre-recession value.

An economy in a recession is operating inside its $PPF$. The fall in output from X to Z in Figure~\ref{fig:growthrecessions} illustrates the effect of a recession. Expenditures on goods and services have declined. Output is less than capacity output, unemployment is up and some plant capacity is idle. Labour income and business profits are lower.  More people would like to work and business would like to produce and sell more output but it takes time for interdependent product, labour and financial markets in the economy to adjust and increase employment and output. Monetary and fiscal policy may be needed to stimulate demand, increase output and employment and move the economy back to capacity output and full employment. The development and implementation of such policies form the core of macroeconomics.

Alternatively, an unexpected increase in demand for exports would increase output and employment. Higher employment and output would increase incomes and expenditure, and in the process spread the effects of higher output sales to other sectors of the economy. The economy would move outside its $PPF$ as at W in Figure~\ref{fig:growthrecessions} by using its resources more intensively than normal. Unemployment would fall and overtime work would increase. Extra production shifts would run plant and equipment for longer hours and work days than were planned when it was designed and installed. Output at this level may not be sustainable, because shortages of labour and materials along with excessive rates of equipment wear and tear would push costs and prices up. Again we will examine how the economy reacts to such a state in our macroeconomic analysis.

\input{figures/ch1/ch1fig6}

Output and employment in the Canadian economy over the past twenty years fluctuated about growth trend in the way Figure~\ref{fig:growthrecessions} illustrates. For several years prior to 2008 the Canadian economy operated slightly above the economy's capacity; but once the recession arrived monetary and fiscal policy were used to fight it -- to bring the economy back from a point such as Z to a point such as X on the $PPF$.

\subsection*{Macroeconomic models and policy}

The $PPF$ diagrams illustrate the main dimensions of macroeconomics: capacity output, growth in capacity output and business cycle fluctuations in actual output relative to capacity. But these diagrams do not offer explanations and analysis of macroeconomic activity. We need a macroeconomic \textit{model} to understand and evaluate the causes and consequences of business cycle fluctuations. As we shall see, these models are based on explanations of expenditure decisions by households and business, financial market conditions, production costs and producer pricing decisions at different levels of output. Models also capture the objectives fiscal and monetary policies and provide a framework for policy evaluation.  A full macroeconomic model integrates different sector behaviours and the feedback across sectors that can moderate or amplify the effects of changes in one sector on national output and employment.

Similarly, an economic growth model provides explanations of the sources and patterns of economic growth. Demographics, labour market structures and institutions, household expenditure and saving decisions, business decisions to spend on new plant and equipment and on research and development,  government policies in support of education, research, patent protection, competition and international trade conditions interact in the growth process. They drive the growth in the size and productivity of the labour force, the growth in the capital stock, and the advances in technology that are the keys to growth in aggregate output and output per person.

\section*{Conclusion}

We have covered a lot of ground in this introductory chapter. It is intended to open up the vista of economics to the new student in the discipline. Economics is powerful and challenging, and the ideas we have developed here will serve as conceptual foundations for our exploration of the subject. Our next chapter deals with methods and models in greater detail.
