## Third problem set: Public goods {-}

*Goals of this problem set:*

Through worked problems and discussion, you will better understand the concept of a public good (or a club good), its (usual) underprovision by the market, and the difficulties with determining and implementing optimal government provision. Some of the questions in the problem sent touch on Game theory, as the optimal provision choice by one person might (or might not) depend on the amount provided by others.

\

In considering the losses of consumer surplus from pricing above the marginal cost (of allowing another person to access the good), this also provides insight into the deadweight loss of monopoly, a topic we will get to soon.

**16.8 parts a and b**

Suppose there are three people in society who vote on whether the government should undertake specific projects. Let the net benefits of a particular project be 150,  140, and 50 dollars for persons A, B, and C, respectively.

a. If the project costs \$300 and these costs are to be shared equally, would a majority vote to undertake the project? What would be the net benefits to each person under such a scheme? Would total net benefits be positive?

\

b. Suppose the project cost \$375 and again costs were to be shared equally. Now, would a majority vote for the project and would total net benefits be positive?



**16.9 parts a-c**

The town of Pleasantville is thinking of building a swimming pool. Building and operating the pool will cost the town \$5,000 per day. There are three groups of potential pool users in Pleasantville:

1. 1,000 families who are each willing to pay \$3 per day for the pool
2. 1,000 families who are each willing to pay \$2 per day for the pool, and
3. 1,000 families who are each willing to pay \$1 per day for the pool.

Suppose also that the intended pool is large enough so that whatever number of families come on any day will not affect what people are willing to pay for the pool. (I.e., no congestion)

1a. Which property of public goods does this pool have? Which does it not have?

b.  Would building the pool be an efficient use of resources?

c. Consider four possible prices for family admission to the pool: (1) \$3, (2) \$2, (3) \$1, and (4) \$0. Which of these prices would result in covering the cost of the pool? Which of the prices would achieve an efficient allocation of resources?

**'Not 16.7'**


**NOTE:** For the problem below ('Not 16-7'), first solve this with the **marginal cost of 180 per unit.**

Next, solve it as written but

```{block2,  type='warning'}
Note that the problem as written is fairly difficult and the textbook answer is incorrect.
```


In each case, assume for part b that the public good will be provided at marginal cost.

<br> \bigskip

Suppose the 'demand curves' referred to are, as discussed in lecture, the amount an individual consumer would purchase if she knew no one else would purchase any of the public good. Remember that this is the same as her marginal benefit curve (her marginal benefit of the *total* amount provided Q).

Also assume that these MB curves will *never* become negative. The minimum marginal benefit is 0.
