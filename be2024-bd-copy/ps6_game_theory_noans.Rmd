### NS 5.6 - Mixed strategy NE {-}

*Note to 2019-20 Be2038 students:* You will not be asked to compute the Mixed strategy NE on an exam. However, this exercise will help you understand mixed strategies better, and I *may* ask you questions about when there will be a  mixed strategy Nash equilibrium and about what these MSNE mean on an exam. Understanding the 'best response (BR)' function is also important. ;Furthermore, this question will be good practice in terms of algebra and computations that will be relevant to other parts of the exam/module.

### Grazing sheep: a game with a continuous action space {-}

*Note to 2019-20 Bee2038 students:** I will  not ask you to compute best response functions for continuous action games nor to do the computations mentioned below on an exam.
However, I want you to understand the concepts and principles,  how to interpret  a best response functions diagram,  and the nature of this collective action problem.   I believe that by going through all parts of this problem it will help you understand this.

\


This setup comes from NS problem 5.10

Consider the Tragedy of the Commons game from the chapter with two shepherds, A and B, where $s_A$ and $s_B$ denote the number of sheep each grazes on the common pasture.

Assume that the benefit per sheep (in terms of mutton and wool) for each shepherd equals $300 - s_A - s_B$

implying that the total benefit to A from a flock of $s_A$ sheep, $\pi_A$ is $\pi_A = s_A\times(300 - s_A - s_B)$.

Similarly for shepherd B, switching $s_A$ and $s_B$, we have total benefit  $\pi_B = s_B\times(300 - s_A - s_B)$
\

Taking the derivative of this with respect to $s_A$, we see that the marginal benefit of an additional sheep by farmer A ($s_A$) is
$MB_A(s_A) = 300 - 2s_A - s_B$.

Similarly for farmer B, $MB_B(s_B) = 300 - 2s_B - s_A$.



Assume that the (total and marginal) cost of grazing sheep is zero since the common can be freely used.

\

1. State the formula that tells us how many sheep farmer A will graze (as a function of the number of sheep B grazes).
State the formula that tells us how many sheep farmer B will graze (as a function of the number of sheep A grazes). \

2. Check your answer to see that you have correctly derived these best response functions.
   Now use these to derive the (outcome that is consistent with) Nash equilibrium.

\

\

3. Now draw the farmers' 'best response functions' in a diagram.

\

\

4. Consider the BR diagram (you may want to check the answer to the previous question first).

- In this context, are sheep 'strategic complements' or 'strategic substitutes'? Explain.

- How can you identify the Nash equilibrium (outcome) on this diagram?

\


[Suggested answer](#ansgs4)
\
5. Now consider the *total surplus of these shepherds*:

$$\pi_A+\pi_B =  s_A\times(300 - s_A - s_B)+s_B\times(300 - s_A - s_B)$$
$$(s_A+s_B)\times(300 - s_A - s_B).$$


Rewrite this in terms of the TOTAL number of sheep grazed $S$ defined as $s_A+s_B$ (try it before looking).

\

This yields

$$\pi_A+pi_B = S\times(300 - S).$$

\

Derive the number of sheep grazed that maximises this *total profit*.Each

\
(Hint: taking the derivative we see that total profits increase in the number of sheep at rate  $300-2S$.

\


If each farmer grazed half of this optimal number, what profit would they each gain, and how does this compare to their profits under Nash-equilibrium play?

What concept does this illustrate?

### 'Teen choices' dominant strategies, pure-strategy Nash equilibria, and understanding the mixed strategy NE

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/teenchoices.png")
```

Teens A and B are smitten with each other but neither knows of the other’s feelings. Suppose the teachers at their school organize a dance.  The “payoff” is based on whether their advances are rebuffed or accepted.  If they both Declare,  they get positive utility but if they are Rebuffed they face humiliation (significantly negative payoff).  Rebuffing an advance slightly elevates the teen’s standing with peers.

1.  What is a teen’s dominant strategy, or is there no dominant strategy?

## Game theory

### problem set problem I --  a final question on game theory (Cover in 5-10 minutes max) {-}

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/bestresponses.jpg")
```

Consider a game where governments of countries A and B simultaneously choose how many fishing boats to allow in the Arctic sea to allow from their country. Country A gets a net benefit (benefits minus costs) $s_A(120-s_A-s_B)$ and B gets a net benefit of $s_B(120-s_A-s_B)$, where $S_A$ and $S_B$ are the boats allowed by countries A and B, respectively.  This leads to the best response functions depicted above.

Which statement below is True:

A. The more boats country A allows, the more boats country B wants to allow \

B. There is a unique Nash Equilibrium \

C. The Pareto Optimal, efficient outcome is for each country to allow 40 boats \

D. There are multiple Nash Equilibria in this game \

E. There are no Nash Equilibria in this game \



[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

### Ans: {-}
B. There is a unique Nash Equilibrium

... this is the unique point where the best response functions intersect, where each country is best responding to one another. B's best response when B allows 40 boats is to also allow 40 boats, and vice-versa.

False answers explained:

- A is false because these BR functions are both negative sloping; this is also intuitive as the benefit of allowing an additional boat declines the more boats the other country allows.

- C is false because it is not efficient in the Pareto optimality sense.
    - To compute this, for Pareto optimality here we would need that total boats are at the point where the total net marginal benefit is zero. If it were positive, more boats could be allowed. If it were negative, fewer boats should be allowed. In either case the total surplus could be increased and split between the two countries. If an improvement can be made for both parties, the original situation is not Pareto optimal.
    - But you do not need to compute this; each country's boats are exerting a negative externality on the others'. We know each country will not care about this, so they will choose *too many* boats from a total (both countries) net-benefit context. This is a 'tragedy of the commons' situation; it is similar to a prisoner's dillemma, but in the context of continuous strategy space (any positive number of boats, rather than Rat vs. Silent)

- D is false because B is true. (Note that I will *never* ask you to consider mixed strategy equilibria in a continuous-strategy context, only perhaps in a matrix game like BoS)

- E is false because B is true

<br> \bigskip

... For B, if you wanted to compute this, consider the *total benefit* $S\times(120-S)$, where $S=s_A+S_B$. Taking the 'first order condition' (set derivative equal to 0) yields $120-2S=0$ $\rightarrow S^{\ast}=60$  Note this is fewer boats than the Nash Equilibrium $s_A+s_B=40+40=80$, and it yields correspondingly higher total benefit: $60\times(120-60)=3600 > 2\times 40 \times (120-40-40)=3200$.
