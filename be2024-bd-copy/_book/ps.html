\textcolor{red}{GTA's:}
Ten minutes, i.e., minutes 5-15 of of tutorial, perhaps (after introducing yourself etc).

Really try to get the students involved in doing this... call on them, ask questions, bring them up, have them do it on their desks or show their answers in pairs

1.1.a-b should be very easy for most. However, there are likely some students who are math-challenged and actually do need to think about this carefully. There are also (unfortunately) a cohort of students who have not really taken Economics before!

Explain the axes briefly, and what each point means (ask students first). Graph a few points, connect the lines, have students comment on the slope and whether it ‘makes sense’.

Try to get them to make a correct statement about why ‘demand curves slope down’ (at a higher price, fewer consumers are willing to buy, and consumers willing to buy fewer units, because at a higher price, they can do better by buying other things with that money)
. . . and why ‘supply curves slope up’.

Be careful to make a distinction between ‘Demand curves’ and ‘Quantity demanded’. *Avoid* the use of ambiguous  language like ‘demand increases’.

Ask them to consider how would one find ‘points on a supply curve’ versus ‘points on a demand curve'; remember that in the real-world by simply observing prices and quantities we don’t know whether we are seeing shifts in a demand curve, shifts in a supply curve, or both.

<p><strong>1.1.B: Do these points lie along two straight lines? If so, figure out the precise algebraic equation of these lines. (Hint: If the points do lie on straight lines, you need only consider two points on each of them to calculate the lines.) </strong></p>
<!--

[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

*Yes, they do. The 'rise over run' between any two points is the same.*

\textcolor{gray}{E.g., for supply, when price rises from 1 to 2,  quantity supplied rises from 100 to 300, for a 'rise over run' of 200/1=200.
OK, as we plot price on the vertical axis, we could say that the "rise" is the rise in price of 2-1=1 and the "run" is the rise in quantity supplied or 300-100=200, for a 'rise over run' of 1/200.}

\textcolor{gray}{For any other pair of points on this supply curve this is the same; e.g as price rises from 3 to 5, $Q_s$ rises from 500 to 900, for a 'rise over run' of $5-3/900-500 = 2/400=1/200$}

\textcolor{gray}{For the demand curve we could make similar calculations but the slopes will be negative.}

*Now to figure out the algebraic equation...*

- (Recall GCSE maths formula for straight line: $y=mx+b$)

- This is a linear function $P = a+bQ$ (when we get to demand, we allow $b$ to be negative)

*Essentially repeating the above 'rise over run' calculation'...*

- For supply, increase P by 1 and Q increases by 200. (See diagram)
    - i.e, for $\Delta P = 1$, $\Delta Q = 200$
    - ... implying that if price were to increase by 1, firms would be willing to provide 200 more units in total

\textcolor{gray}{Doing this more carefully ... if we have any two points, $x_1,y_1$ and $x_2,y_2$ we can compute the slope $m= \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$, again 'rise over run'.}

\textcolor{gray}{Take any two points on the supply curve (the table above), and compute this to get the slope.}

\textcolor{gray}{E.g., $(P_1,Q_1)$ = $(1,100)$ and $(P_2,Q_2)$=$(2,300)$.  The slope is thus $\frac{(300-100)}{(2-1)}=200.$ as stated above. However, this is the slope of $Q$ in $P$. Confusingly, although economists usually consider how $Q$ changes in $P$ along supply (or demand curves), our convention is to plot $P$ on the vertical axis an $Q$ on the horizontal. So, when drawing the slope, remember to keep this straight. If the slope of Q in P is 200, the slope of P in Q is actually the inverse of this, namely $1/200$. (Check: $\frac{P_2-P_1}/{Q2-Q1}=1/200$). Also note that a slope of $1/200$ would look almost flat, so it's better to make the quantity axis in units of 100, so you can do a slope of 1/2 (vertical increase of 1 units for each 2 units of horizontal increase).}

- Thus $\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q} = \frac{1}{200}$
    - We know the slope $b=\frac{1}{200}$
    - $\rightarrow P = a + \frac{q}{200}$

*What about the intercept $a$?*
Just plug some value into the formula and solve for this.
    - at $P=2$, $Q=300$
    - $\rightarrow 2 = a + \frac{300}{200} = a + \frac{3}{2}$
    - so $a = \frac{1}{2}$
- Thus the equation is $P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{Q_s}{200}$
- or $Q_s=200P-100$

\footnote{Check: does this equation describe the graph? Is it intuitive? Supply upward-sloping in price. Intercept: $P>1/2$ necessary for a positive quantity supplied.}

\

For demand, increase P by 1 and Q declines by 100.

- Solves similarly to above:
    - $\rightarrow$ $P=8-\frac{Q_d}{100}$ or $Q_d=800-100p$

**Ans:**

- Draw these functions on the same graph to aid intuition

[comment]: <> (TABB)

\textcolor{red}{GTA's:} Do draw this on the board, this time on the same axes (supply and demand curves together) ... or add one to the other, already on the board.

[comment]: <> (TAEE)

- $Q_s(P)=200P-100$, at $P=0$, $Q_s = -100$
    - we must not forget that we actually mean $Q_s(p)=max(0,200P-100)$, so $Q_s(0) = 0$

[comment]: <> (TABB)

\textcolor{red}{GTA's:} Let's explain at this point what the "max" and "min" functions mean. Give a few examples.

[comment]: <> (TAEE)

- $Q_d(P)=800-100P$ $\rightarrow$ $Q_d(0)=800$
- $\rightarrow$ Excess demand at $P = 0$ is $Q_d(0)-Q_s(0)=800-0 = 800$.

*Consider: does this make sense? If the government declared 'orange juice must be free' and imposed no subsidies, would you expect there to be excess demand?*

[comment]: <> (TABB)

\textcolor{red}{GTA's:} The students are likely to find this difficult, especially the ‘max’ thing. Practice how to explain this in advance so you don’t get tongue-tied.

<p><strong>MCQ2 True or False: One example of microdata is a set of over 5 million observations of income, hours worked, and demographic information from over 1 million households’ tax returns over five years.</strong></p>
<p><br> </p>
<!--
[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

**Answer:**

True. Microdata refers to the level of the unit of observation; the economic decision-maker, such as an individual or household, rather than an aggregation, such as an entire country or market. 65\% got this one right.

\textcolor{gray}{Note – this was covered in the mini-lecture ‘Empirical microeconomics/econometrics’ as well as in the text. Again, this is a ‘challenge question’; if you read carefully, and read the suggested applications and additional readings, you should be able to get most of these questions. However, I don’t expect everyone will get these right, so I will limit the number of such questions so that you can still get a good mark without knowing these.
I want you to have more than just a ‘textbook theoretical’ understanding. Understanding how data is used in business, economic analysis, and policy, will be very important in your career!}

<p><strong>MCQ3 True or false: It is valid to plot observed prices and quantities traded in a market and fit a line through them to estimate a market demand curve.</strong></p>
<!--
[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

**Answer:**
False.  "If we plot prices and quantities traded in a market, we are be observing the interaction of shifts in supply and demand curve, so it is difficult to estimate either curve without further assumptions. About 30\% got this one right.

\textcolor{gray}{Again, this is a challenge question. Remember: I will ask some questions where the answer is not ‘common-sense’ answer that someone who has not taken Economics would give. And this is what you should want: if you study and engage, you should understand more after taking this module than you did when you started it!}

<p><strong>MCQ5: True or false: If people who attended university earn more than those who did not, this proves that university makes people more productive.</strong></p>
<!--

[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

**Answer:**

False. Those who attended university may have had a greater potential to earn money whether or not they *actually* attended university. They may have been more skilled, hardworking, etc.

If we had a clean experiment randomly assigning people to university we might be able to credibly assert that attending university did *cause* later outcomes, and perhaps caused these people to earn more money. However, we still would not that this occurred through the *channel* of making people more productive. There are other reasons why completing university may increase income other than 'making people more productive'.

<h3>Discussion questions</h3>
<p><strong>Consider the following statement:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gasoline sells for $4.00 per <em>gallon</em> this year, and it sold for $3.00 per gallon last year.
But consumers bought more gasoline this year than they did last year.
This is clear proof that the economic theory that people buy less when the price rises is incorrect.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree? Explain.</em></p>
<!--
[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

### Ans:

Other things may have changed, including tastes, income, the population; these could *shift* the market demand curve.
This does not invalidate the more general proposition that 'people buy less when the price rises, all else equal'.

<p><strong>MCQ2 True or False: One example of microdata is a set of over 5 million observations of income, hours worked, and demographic information from over 1 million households’ tax returns over five years.</strong></p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>True. Microdata refers to the level of the unit of observation; the economic decision-maker, such as an individual or household, rather than an aggregation, such as an entire country or market. 65% got this one right.</p>

*Suggested answer* \
b,c,d. \
Transitivity and complete preferences (violated in a and e) are required axioms to have a utility representation. \
Monotonicity (b) is a common assumption for preferences and utility functions \
Unemployed people have preferences and utility functions just as do everyone else. Even someone with *no* income may have a utility function.
You can dislike any good, even chicken, and have a utility function ... that good will simply not enter into this function (or it may enter negatively if it's a 'bad').

<!-- [comment]: <> (ANSBB)

*Suggested answer* \
-  This plan may be optimal if it involves buying only beer and no steak. 
-  If this plan involves a positive amount of beer and steak, it is not optimal: the individual would prefer to buy more beer and less steak.


Let's skip the formulae and just reason.

At her current level of consumption, steak is three times  as valuable to her as beer (per unit), yet it costs *four times* as much per unit. At the margin, every pound she spends, she can buy one steak or four beers; the latter would yield twice as much utility.
This means she should buy more beer and less steak.

As she does this, the MU of beer will decline, and the MU of steak will increase ... and she should keep making this shift until the rate she is willing to trade off steak to obtain beer is '1 steak per 4 beers', reflecting the price ratio.

However, if this point already represents "only buying beer and not steak" she cannot buy less than no steak.

<br> \bigskip

The tricky thing here is that at the point mentioned, steak is providing 3x as much utility 'per unit', but it costs 4 times as much, so the 'bang for the buck' is lower.

<p><em>Extra practice to aid understanding</em>:
- Draw this using indifference curves and a budget constraint, considering each of the cases (‘positive amount of each, only one, only the other’)</p>
<!-- [comment]: <> (TABB)

<font color='red'>GTA's:</font> Please draw this on the board at this point (indifference curves, budget constraint). Do all of this with student volunteers, or with the help of student input ('am I doing this right? ... 'should the line be here or here...? Should this curve slope upwards anywhere?').  Practice this in advance because it's easy to make an error (you might set up the axes in advance to save time). Suggest the students 'draw along'. Even though they don't need to draw this to answer the question, it may help them understand it.

Put beer on the vertical axis, so the budget constraint has a slope of (about) -4 (you might want to scale the axes a bit, otherwise the steep diagram is too hard to draw). Draw at least one indifference curve where the curve intersects the budget constraint at a point where the slope is -2 ... somewhat shallower than the budget constraint. This point will be towards the bottom right of the budget constraint.

Note that at this point the consumer is, at the margin willing to give up 3 beers to get 1 steak (the slope is 2) but she would have to give up 4 beers to get a steak, which would make her worse off (moving down and to the right along the B.C.). However, if she is willing to give up 2 beers to gain 1 steak, she is also willing to give up 1 steak to gain 2 beers, or half a steak to gain 1 beer, but she only needs to give up 1/4 of a steak to gain a beer. Thus 'moving up and to the left' along the B.C. makes her better off.


<font color='red'>GTA's:</font> This would be a good one to cover I expect some students will still be puzzled by this. Try to get such a student to explain it in her own words. Something like. . .

> if, where I am now each steak gives me twice as much happiness as a beer, but costs four times as much, it’s not worth it. In fact, this means that per pound sterling, steak gives me less happiness than beer. Logically, this means that actually beer gives me more happiness per £ than steak given my current levels. So I should buy more beer and less steak.

Draw it again for the 'no steak' case... redrawwing the indifference curves of course.

<h3>Individual optimisation solved problem</h3>
<p>John M. Countryside makes £50 per week at his summer job and spends his entire weekly income on leeks and chocolate, because these are the only two items that provide utility to him. John gains utility from both of these; his utility is <span class="math inline">\(U(\ell,c)=c^{\frac{1}{3}}\ell^{\frac{2}{3}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> is the number of ounces of leeks he consumes and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> the number of ounces of chocolate he consumes.</p>
<p><br />
a. If leeks costs £2 per ounce and chocolates cost £1 per ounce, how many will John buy of each in a week? Please show your steps: state the optimisation condition and constraint and then solve. Recall the power rule for derivatives: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{dx}ax^{b}=bax^{b-1}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(b\neq0\)</span>.</p>
<!-- [comment]: <> (ANSBB)
*Suggested answer* \
$MU_{\ell}={\frac{2}{3}}c^{\frac{1}{3}}\ell^{-\frac{1}{3}}$

$MU_{c}={\frac{1}{3}}c^{-\frac{2}{3}}\ell^{\frac{2}{3}}$

For optimisation (where the second order condition holds, and where we consume some of both so it's not a corner solution; this will be the case here, extra points if anyone mentions this and more if they derive it):

$MU_{\ell}/MU_{c}=MRS=p_{\ell}/p_{c}$

$\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{\frac{2}{3}}c^{\frac{1}{3}}\ell^{-\frac{1}{3}}/{\frac{1}{3}}c^{-\frac{2}{3}}\ell^{\frac{2}{3}}=\frac{2}{1}$

$\rightarrow2c^{\frac{1}{3}}\ell^{-\frac{1}{3}}/c^{-\frac{2}{3}}\ell^{\frac{2}{3}}=2$

$\rightarrow c\ell^{-1}=1$

$\rightarrow c=\ell$

A slightly simpler way would have been to first make a monotonic transformation of the utility function, cubing it: $(U(\ell,c))^{3}=(c^{\frac{1}{3}}\ell^{\frac{2}{3}})^{3}=c\ell^{2}$. Then $MU_{\ell}=2c\ell$ and $MU_{c}=\ell^{2}$, implying $MU_{\ell}/MU_{c}=2c\ell/l^{2}=2c/\ell$... set equal to the price ratio $2c/\ell=2\rightarrow c=\ell$.

Partial credit: We also know the above is a Cobb-Douglas utility function so expenditure shares will be constant and reflect the relative power coefficients; as the coefficient on $\ell$ is twice that on c, we will spend twice as much on $\ell$, which, as it is twice as expensive, means buying the same amount of each.

Budget constraint: $2\ell+c=50$

Substituting in:

$2\ell+;w
\ell=50\rightarrow3\ell=50\rightarrow\text{\ensuremath{\ell}=50/3}$

$c=\ell=50/3$

Check all the budget is spent: $2(50/3)+1(50/3)=50$

$MU_{\ell}/MU_{c}=MRS=2c\ell/l^{2}=2c/\ell$ still holds

Set it equal to the new price ratio: $2c/\ell=1\text{\ensuremath{\rightarrow}c=\ensuremath{\ell}/2}$

New budget constraint: $2\ell+2c=50$
