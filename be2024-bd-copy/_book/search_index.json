This text aligns with a great deal of this module. I recommend you purchase, or find easy access to some edition of this book (new editions should be £50, used editions should be cheaper), the publisher also sells an online-only version. In the future I hope to turn this online resource into a full interactive, collaborative, open-access online text, adapting material from other open-access resources, but I am not there yet. Update: Free online access to this text may be available through your university/library (this works at Exeter) via www.vlebooks.com See some alternative and supplemental free texts and resources BELOW In particular, the open source online text Microeconomics - markets, methods and models by Curtis and Irvine covers much of the same material, and I draw from it substantially (with attribution under the CC license) in this web resource. Principles of Economics - unnamed authors is also very related, and appears pretty good, I also draw from it heavily (with attribution under the CC license) in this web resource. (Referred to as ‘PRUM’) For example, from time to time I will refer you (and draw from) another open source work that has very clear explanations: Quantum Microeconomics… with or without Calculus by Yoram Baumann, the self-proclaimed ‘World’s First Standup Economist’ On this module (Exeter: BEE2038 - Intermediate Microeconomics - for students not doing a straight Economics degree) Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics! I hope that this module helps you see the world in a new way and gain insights about business, government, and your everyday life. If you put the time into this module, you can get a lot out of it, and you may gain skills and access approaches that you will use throughout your career. As students at a Russell group institution, I expect you to work hard and engage intellectually to gain a serious and critical understanding of key Economics concepts. Learn how and when these can be applied, what their limitations are, and how these can these are misused and misunderstood. I hope you learn these core ideas well enough that you could explain them to others and apply them to unfamiliar situations. This is not necessary to gain a good mark: I hope that you all will be able to gain a good mark, and I will try to be lenient. But I would suggest you aspire to get more out of this than a mark. You should aim not only to achieve a distinction mark, but to be able to impress me with your understanding and insight, to gird your loins for future courses applying this material, and to gain the acumen to understand key research issues, and participate in business discussions and policy debates. I wrote these notes to outline all of the material you are responsible for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short amount of time we have during lecture. I don’t mean you’re simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that these notes will aim to refer to everything that you are responsible for. These notes are meant to be a complement to the textbook (and to the lectures, tutorials/problem sets, readings and other material on the ELE) and to tie all of this together. (However, as I add to these notes I hope to turn this into an open-access textbook that will replace the text.) I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in these notes. However, each year the module adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to these notes as we go along. I will try to keep you informed of any changes via the VLE forums. Notes versus slides?: These notes should include all of the slide material plus explanatory notes and enrichment material. (However, I left out some of the jokes.) I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will also try to make the slides themselves available after the lectures, even though they are redundant– these notes have everything.1 Some ‘markers’ and abbreviations: ‘NS’ refers to the Nicholson and Snyder text (usually chapters/numbering from the 12th edition is referenced; if you’re using an earlier edition, make sure the content corresponds) ‘CM’ refers to Microeconomics - markets, methods and models by Curtis and Irvine ‘PRUM’ refers to Principles of Economics - unnamed authors, University of Minnesota ‘Adv’ indicates advanced material and discussion you are not required to know but may find interesting, and will help you in later courses/modules in Economics, and give you a hint at what is to come if you pursue this course further. Knowing this stuff might also help your mark and the impression you make when asking for letters of reference. This is also included to give you a more nuanced picture: when I took a similar module as an undergraduate I tended to believe ‘all the economics problems are solved and the solutions and implications are obvious.’ These ‘Adv’ comments are often caveats and critiques. ‘Adv, math’ indicates advanced mathematical material. (I’ve moved most of this to footnotes). Text in blue usually refers to questions you should try to answer on your own (and I sometimes provide suggested answers in the footnotes. Try to answer it yourself first.) Some text is given in gray to indicate that this is a side point or a discussion. (I’m moving most of this to footnotes.) ‘Comprehension Q:’ A question you should be able to answer if you are following along. ‘T numbers’ (take these loosely please) refer to the weeks of term in which I intended to cover specific material. For example ‘T1:03 - T1:04a’ means ‘term 2 week three (both lectures) and term 2 week 4, first lecture only’ Course Information Some quick notes on this module and how it fits into your course structure This module is: Compulsory for BSc Business Economics and BA Business Economics Also for PPE I believe The prerequisites are BEE1029 (for most students) or BEE1034 or BEE1030 and BEE1031 The prerequisites are very different, the students in this module may come from diverse backgrounds. We will try to focus on material: not covered in BEE1029 or more rigorous and detailed versions of this, and real world applications, especially in business. Some of you may have already seen some of the material covered here. If so, try to learn it in more detail, become better at explaining it to others, and learn to apply it to real-world issues. Note: From 2020 onwards, all students in this module will come from the “CORE ESPP” You may also find this to be a useful resource, for revision, motivation, and as a supplement to the Nicholson/Snyder text (Also, see “The Economy” 1.0) for more straight Economics A note on maths: As I will explain, this course will involve a certain level of maths; things like simple algebra, understanding what functions are and how to draw them, and understanding the very basic idea that ‘the derivative of a function is a function telling you the slope of the original function’. If you are math-phobic, you need to try to get over this and make maths your friend and your horse. You can ride it for miles! You will also come to notice that I emphasize logic, precise definitions, and careful connected explanations. I don’t want you to be saying/writing things that could be interpreted in multiple ways, like “the demand will go up”. However, this is not the core Economics module (bee2038: Microeconomics II). If you want a more precise, theoretically complete and mathematically rigorus treatment of this material, particularly if you are studying Economics and/or want to go to postgraduate study in a related field you probably should switch to that module. Further suggested maths resources are given below, under (#Other-maths-resources). 2018: Note to students in Managerial economics who took the BEE1034 ‘Economics for Management’ last term I realise that you are facing a special challenge this year because of the changes in this particular prerequisite module, with less ‘conventional Economics’ covere . In 2018 I discussed with your student-staff liaison committee chair on how to give you further support. One of the things she suggested was to point you in the direction of the text Edexcel AS/A level Economics. This should be accessible online. I have looked through this book and I agree that it will be helpful both as a prerequisite and to give you a more basic explanation (A-levels) of some of the things that we are covering in this module. In particular (note these chapters are very short): From “theme one: introduction to markets and market failure” Chapter one: Economics as a social science Chapter 3: the economic problem Chapter 4: production possibility frontiers Chapter 7: rational decision-making Chapter 8: Demand (super-important!) but please don’t use their somewhat imprecise language \"fall/increase in demand/increase in demand) (Chapters 9 and 10 are essentially re-covered from scratch in our module, going beyond A-level material) Chapter 11: Supply Chapter 12: price determination Chapter 13: the price mechanism (much of Chapters 14, 15, and 16 cover material overlapping what we are covering, again at a more basic ‘A-levels’ level; you may find these helpful) From ‘Theme 3: business behaviour and the labour market’ Chapter 42: revenue Chapter 43: Production chapter 44: Costs (we don’t get to all of this in this module) chapter 45: profit Chapter 46: market structure (just to get the basic idea) Chapter 47: perfect competition Chapter 50: monopoly (we re-cover much of this and go a bit further) (Much of these chapters in theme 3, as well as chapter 54, overlaps what we are covering, but at the A-level) I also highly recommend the microeconomics material from the Khan Academy; I will also give you an outline of which sections are most relevant there. Of course I am also very accessible if you have any questions or need clarification, or just want to talk about some of the material you are struggling with. As I always say, you should feel free to come by my office hours or to make a special appointment outside of these hours I think students who have come to my office hours will definitely agree that they have found been helpful and not stressful. I also encourage you to ask specific questions on the ELE student forum which I will answer carefully. You can also ask questions directly on any of the dropbox hosted files if you get a free dropbox account, and I will try to respond to all of these.

It seeks, in particular, to increase the students’ abilities to, independently, pose and solve economic questions, especially those relating to policy issues. It emphasises the fundamental conceptual foundations in microeconomics and provides concrete examples of their applications.

You also may want to get involved in research (doing it, using it) yourself; let me know if you want to chat about this. If you are thinking of going on to postgraduate study, or are interested in a job involving research, I would strongly advise you to do a final-year undergraduate dissertation. We now have an Economics-specific module for this. You can see some of my research on my webpage and some of my impact projects at the links above 1.3 This module bee2038: Intermediate Microeconomics (applied) Lectures Problem sets: There are eight problem sets, each covering a specific block of material. The material in these problem sets either comes from exams or builds exam skills. These will be posted BELOW. Representative answers for each problem set will be given a few days after each problem set is released, or shortly before the relevant support class. Classes (AKA ‘tutorials’ AKA ‘seminars’) every fortnight (5 total) Support classes will largely focus on covering (exploring, solving, discussing) the problem sets. However, there will obviously not be time to cover every question in the tutorial. Note there are only 5 tutorials but 8 problem sets; thus, tutorials may cover problems from multiple recent problem sets. These classes are about applying material you have learned, not lecturing on it or learning it for the first time. Come ready to ask questions and participate: The classes are a smaller group setting than the lectures; we aim to make these highly interactive and participatory. To really be helpful, we need to know what areas you might be struggling with and where your logic might be breaking down; thus we will either do cold calling or highly encourage all the students in these tutorials to ask and answer questions. Think of these as (especially) ‘safe spaces’; you will be judged or marked based on your performance in the support classes, and there are no dumb questions. If you have a question many of your peers probably have the same question, so asking it provides a public good. First ‘midterm’ examination, 90 minutes, fully MCQ (but may require ‘choose all that are correct’); 15 marks (30% of term mark) Final examination, 120 minutes, MCQ, solved problems, short essays: 35 marks (70% of term mark) Important: Final exam open response (essays/short answer) questions test your deep understanding and ability to explain concepts. I will help you prepare for this, and give you examples. Five essential competencies (for economics students) Apply the scientific process to economic phenomena Analyse and evaluate behaviors and outcomes using economic concepts and models Use quantitative approaches in Economics Think critically about economic methods and their applications Communicate economic ideas in diverse collaborations paraphrased from Algood and Bayer, 2017 American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings, “Learning outcomes for economists”. This module particularly emphasizes 5, and also 2 and 4. These skills are also highly relevant to employers updated link: Texts and resources Recommended text: ‘Intermediate Microeconomics and Its Application’ (12th ed.) Should be available at the University bookstore for around £50, with access to online materials Other recent editions are also OK, but be careful as numbering can change Many other resources online (see below) Note that there are a variety of sources and online courses — any intermediate or advanced textbook in Microeconomics will cover virtually the same material. There are now texts available for free, legally, online, such as Microeconomics Markets, Methods &amp; Models; an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine: A full-fledged text covering many of the topics of this module, without calculus Intermediate microeconomics - M Walbert Illinois tutorials - click ‘tutorials’: A series of tutorials for an intermediate microeconomics module. Covers many of the topics of this module. No calculus but a lot of algebra. Lots of supplementary materials too. Quantum Microeconomics; consider the version either with or without calculus: An unconventional but very careful and interesting approach; my impression is that it is well organised and explained Principles of Economics 2e, Openstax by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine - very well organised, not quite ‘intermediate’, not enough maths for my taste, but may be very helpful as revision and as an additional source of explanations! “Introduction to Economic Analysis”, by Preston McAfee, Caltech and Tracy Lewis, Duke University (note this text uses calculus). Introduction to Economic Analysis - MacAffee, Lewis, Dale: A ‘no-fluff’ text from an esteemed source. Covers much of this module, but a bit at the more advanced side (actually the level varies greatly throughout). Includes calculus and lots of parametric examples. Lots of solved problems. Some resources on CORE , mentioned above, may be helpful, but that needs further investigation, as it is aimed at year-one Economics. I also recommend Simple economics on the web, which contains a great number of useful interactive graphical and algebraic exercises. Play around with this, they are super-helpful and intuitive. Thanks Frank.) Issues with Nicholson and Snyder text and associated online materials: Students can contact Roxanne Watts for access to any online resources associated with the text, roxanne.watts@cengage.com (tel) 01264347322. Expect response to simple questions in 24 hours (1 business day) Note: The module moves through select parts of this textbook; coverage and order given in this ‘handout’, as well as references to coverage in other texts. Lectures \\(\\neq\\) everything!: Some of the material is only mentioned in lecture/handout, but you still must read &amp; learn it (I will be clear on this). On the other hand some sections of the NS text are skipped. Some material is covered in these handouts, or recommended readings, that is not in the text; this is clearly emphasized. All of this is laid out in this handout. 1.4 Problem sets Note: There will be approximately 8 total problem sets, each covering a block of material. As noted above, these are aimed to help prepare you for the assessments. These will be posted BELOW Representative answers and explanations for each problem set will given about 1-week after posting. The five support classes (tutorials) will cover parts of these. 1.5 Feedback on your highly-esteemed but extremely humble lecturer We will have two ‘official’ feedback points. There will be an ‘early feedback’ survey, perhaps around week 4 or 5. This gives you a chance to give me constructive suggestions that I can adapt to during the rest of the module. For the Accelerate end-of-module feedback, you will be asked to rate me. All of these questions are seen as an evaluation of my performance specifically by the “associate dean”. You will be asked to express an opinion, from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’, on one or more questions about the quality of this module. In particular: Overall I am satisfied with the quality of the module. If at any time you think you don’t agree with any of these, please let me know how I can make it better You can tell me directly, or anonymously at: I am not particularly a fan of the “customer service” model of education. It leads lecturers to water-down the content and hinders us from presenting challenging and engaging material. and limit your educational experience. In fact, there is in fairly compelling research that suggests that these measures are not reliable and are “poorly correlated with student learning”. 1.5.1 Responding to feedback I listen carefully to your responses and continually adjust the material and the approach. To give you the best education, I try to follow a process of Kaizen, or continual improvement. I also make changes from year-to-year, in response to your feedback. Some changes made responding to the previous year’s feedback: Before 2019-20 the module was called “BEE2024 Economic Principles and policy”, and it was divided into a Microeconomics term and a Macroeconomics term.\" To make things simpler, we have renamed this Microeconomics part “BEE2038: Intermediate Microeconomics”, and we no longer share the ELE page. However the coverage is the same as before (allowing for normal year-to-year adjustments). Reduced coverage, enabling better focus. In particular, I have eliminated or consolidated much of the material on the firm’s production function and costs. In earlier surveys, this was the topic students liked the least. In 2019 I am removing the coverage of the history of supply and demand curves and a few other topics. Better integration of the problem sets and tutorials with the lectures and the assessments. Better coordination across tutorial sessions. In 2019 I will be providing more practice multiple-choice questions closely emulating the style of MCQ’s that will be on the midterm and final exam Materials: Greater motivation for each lecture. Less content in the slides themselves (less busy). A more complete narrative in the handout files, making these more readable Opportunity to feedback/discuss the handout and problem sets directly on these files (through Dropbox comments) Lectures, tutorials and notes will have a greater focus on carefully explaining the important concepts that many students struggled with (e.g., Expected Utility) I will try to provide more revision coverage and supplementary materials for managerial economics students. 1.6 The story of this module Note: You will have seen many of these concepts before. But do you really understand them well enough to explain them to a non-economist and to apply them to a new real-world situation? And do you understand the limits and critiques of these, and how economists try to measure and test them? Asessment hint: I try to ask you questions that you would not know the answer to had you not taken this module. What would be the purpose of you simply learning ‘common sense’ or ‘conventional wisdom’ … that you already knew? If you are answering an open response/essay question by simply stating something that the average Joe sitting on a pub bench would have said, you may want to rethink the way you are answering this question. I am not designing the exams to trip you up… just to check that you have learned something. *For details on the coverage in each part, and references to coverage in texts other than NS, see the relevant section below, or the outline above 1.6.1 1. Economic basics (weeks 1-2 approx) In weeks one and two we will go over some of the simple tools in the economists’ kit. I will try to explain to you what we mean by ‘economic models’ and give you some examples of these which may be familiar to you. I will not go over the math tools in the lecture; you should study/revise this on your own. We will go over many of these again briefly as we apply these math tools to our economic models throughout the module. We will also start thinking about, and formalisng individual decisions—over nearly all spheres of life— in a way you may not have seen before, which may even strike you as weirdly hyper-rational. Essentially, this (sometimes confusingly called ‘normative decision theory’) is the way economists typically conceive of and model people’s choices. Even though it seems to require precise optimization, perhaps to a strange extent, there are various reasonable justifications for this, and you might also see it as a benchmark… ‘Let’s understand what optimization would look like, as a starting point’. This framework is actually fairly general; it can allow all sorts of preferences (e.g., embodying ‘risk aversion’ and ‘altruism’) and wide-ranging choices. However it does imply certain ‘restrictions’: it rules out some sort of behavior that is perhaps obviously illogical. We will discuss how ‘preferences’ may define the ‘utility functions’. The ‘uility function’ is the thing that make choices in order to maximize. In the classical framework, people make choices in order to maximise the value of their utility function. Utility functions can also be expressed in terms of ‘indifference curves’ (but keep the distinction in mind; the indifference curves are not themselves the utility functions). Under this framework individuals make the ‘optimal choices’ … by making the choices that yield the maximum value of the utility functions given their constraints … in particular they have a ‘budget constraint’ that says they cannot spend more than they earn. You will learn how to derive these budget constraints and plot these on a graph, along with the indifference curves, and to interpret these diagrams. I will also introduce ‘data’ and some key concepts from ‘Empirical analysis’ and ‘Econometrics’ here 1.6.2 2. Building the model, putting it together, examining it (weeks 3-5 approx) ‘What determines the price and quantities exchanged in an unregulated (or ’free’) market?’ ‘Do markets yield good outcomes?’ These questions have been at the backbone of Economics for millennia, at least since Aristotle. Classical economists such as Adam Smith built-up ideas of how seemingly random and disorganized markets can yield predictable and efficient outcomes, at least under appropriate conditions. Neoclassical and modern economists (such as Alfred Marshall, David Ricardo, Leon Walras, and Paul Samuelson) have formalized these, building models involving of systems of demand and supply and general equilibrium, and have made the case for the efficiency and desirability of the free market outcomes, at least under specified conditions.2 In the second (and largest) chunk of the course, we will learn some of the essential building blocks of this model, and how they are justified and put together to yield predictions for market outcomes and ‘welfare’. In the process, we will get useful ideas and intuitions about the working of markets. We will learn how individual optimization implies a relationship between the price of a good (and the consumer’s income) and the amount a consumer chooses to purchase of that good; her individual demand curve. Adding up these individual demand curves yields the market demand curve, which describes the way the total amount of a good consumers wish to purchase depends on the market price of that good. Note: This is covered NS ch. 6-7, but reading these sections is optional. You are only responsible for the brief ‘sketch’ of this that I provide in this handout and in a short lecture, and any problem sets related to this. Someone has to make this stuff, you know! We consider ‘production functions’ that map how inputs can be turned into outputs. If firms are seeking to maximize profits, then whatever output they want to produce … they will try to produce it using the combination of inputs (Capital, labor, etc.) that can do this at the lowest cost. If we know production functions and input costs, we can describe a firm’s cost of producing every amount of a particular good. Economists typically assume that firms make choices to maximize profits. (Mathematically, this ‘optimisation’, i.e., maximisation, has some things in common with the consumer optimisation of utility, so it may look familiar). Knowing their cost of production and the demand curve they will face, firms will thus choose to produce the amount that yields them the highest profit; we will explain the conditions for this. With ‘free entry/exit of firms’ we have the (ideal) situation of perfect competition. Each firm’s supply curve is added up to generate the market supply curve; we consider this in both the ‘short and long run’. We define the concepts of ‘consumer surplus’ and ‘producer surplus’; adding these yields the total value in an economy or the total ‘social welfare’. We will briefly and roughly consider the idea of an equilibrium in all markets; prices such that quantity demanded equals quantity supplied for all outputs and inputs. We will get some sense of the idea of what general ‘economic efficiency’ means. I will state and give you some intuition behind the ‘first and second welfare theorems’; the conditions under which free markets yield ‘good outcomes’, defined in a particular sense. 1.6.3 3. How the market can go wrong (and how to maybe fix it) (weeks 6-7 approx) Notice I kept saying “under certain conditions” free markets yield good outcomes. These conditions may not hold, for various reasons. In the third chunk, we discuss two of these reasons, which lead to ‘market failures’. It is important to understand these. These (sometimes) offer a justification for government intervention, and help us understand how government can best respond. These also offer insights for business models; which ‘goods’ may be hard to provide without government subsidies, and how can we use technological innovation to capture value and reduce the extent of market failures? (Businesses may also be able to take advantage of market failures in ways that are harmful to public welfare, But I would hate to think I’m training you to do this.) Not all goods can easily be restricted to a single consumer. ‘Non-rival’ and ‘non-excludable’ goods (e.g., a fireworks display) are called public goods: these will tend to be undersupplied by the free market, as we will come to understand. We will also discuss the evidence for the private provision of these, and consider government’s ability to provide them. This is the polar opposite market structure to perfect competition; a monopoly is a single firm that exclusively dominated a particular industry. It will tend to produce less and charge more than would be socially optimal, yielding a ‘deadweight loss’ (aka ‘DWL’). ‘Price discrimination’ is (more or less) when a firm charges different prices to different consumers; this can reduce (or increase) the ‘deadweight loss’ of monopoly, as we will learn. 1.6.4 4. Extensions to the model and applications (weeks 8-11 approx) In the final chunk we extend the model to accommodate some important aspects of the real world. We investigate the implication of these for market outcomes. We make many decisions without knowing exactly what the consequence of each choice will be. Economists typically model this using the “expected utility” framework. A warning: students often get this concept wrong, so be careful. Expected utility is not the same as ‘expected monetary value’; and this allows EU to embody risk aversion. For many decisions we make the consequences depend on what others do; we have ‘strategic interaction’. Economist usually consider this using the framework and tools of game theory. People may not actually make decisions In the hyper-rational way we have been assuming. Here we carefully consider the adaptation of some insights from Psychology to Economics, yielding ‘behavioral economics’ 1.7 The big (small) question What’s gonna be on the exam?? As noted, you are responsible for all material outlined in this handout … the syllabus + assigned readings + materials covered in lecture and tutorials. E.g., the exams may cover material only briefly mentioned in lecture, and will expect knowledge from prerequisites I try to reward broad understanding, rather than merely the ability to memorize a few formulae and definitions. So try to really know this stuff and be able to discuss it and apply it, both to algebraic/numerical examples and to real-world issues. I give you copious examples of what will be on the examinations, including practice problems at the end of each lecture, problem sets, lots of mock and sample question on the VLE, and previous examinations and midterms. You need to work hard; here is the guideline specified… Guided Independent Study per half: 143 hours to be divided between background reading (e.g. 40 hrs), solving/reviewing problem sets (e.g. 40 hrs) and exam revision (e.g. 43 hrs) And now, a pep talk. 1.7.1 The real big question: why are you here? To learn. Because you think it’s interesting to ponder big questions about individuals, markets, and society to understand how people have tried to bring order to difficult questions because you want to contribute something to the world (see above) Because this stuff is actually useful in the real world For your professional career For your life If you want to go into academia (in Economics or otherwise) Some people and organisations seem to value this information: 2017 Government Economic Fast Stream Scheme Don’t waste this experience fretting about marks. Try to actually learn and not just mimic the process, as in ‘cargo cults.’ See Richard Feynman, on cargo cult science: So, why are you here? Perhaps not to hear what the lecturer has to say, but for the lecturer to respond to what you say We live in a world post-printing press and with lots of digital media. To be honest, there are some things about lecturing that are obsolete in my opinion. Anyone can hear great lectures online or read extremely informative textbooks. However, as a student at this Russell group University… You can interact with me, ask me questions, come up with ideas, work with other students. Impress me and get a good letter of reference. I advise everyone to come to my office hours at least once. 1.8 Resources I highly advise you to use the forum to ask and answer questions and make suggestions and comments. Students typically find this forum very useful. VLE link Ask questions and make comments on the forum LINK, I will monitor it Or on these notes themselves using hypothes.is Or, for anonymity, just complain on social media and I’ll probably see it. Email For specific questions comments about your degree scheme and requirements, is best to contact the Building One ‘help desk’, or the appropriate help desk for your degree. If you have a question about course material or coverage which other students will be interested in, please post this on the forum. If you email me I may respond by asking you to post this on the form. If you have a specific question that needs private attention then email me and I will try to respond. However, if it is a longer question I may ask you to come to my office hours or schedule a time to meet. Stay tuned for the ‘announcements’ Also, there is a bunch of other material on the VLE. Remember to do practice questions and formative assessments! 1.8.1 In-lecture interaction Even though our lecture time is scarce, It seems to me that to get value out of this antiquated format known as a lecture, we should have at least some interaction. Otherwise, you may as well be watching a video. Some things we may work with include: Responseware, questions, polls and ‘chat’; ‘Kahoot’ In-lecture experiments and games Remember to install Responseware on your smart phones, or get a free turningpoint clicker! Download it on app stores, or use it on a laptop the session id is ‘david’ (check) browser mode: To get the most out of the lectures, I advise you to Ask me questions, especially at beginning and end, raise both hands if you are lost Draw-along and solve-along with the slides and board work. The act of trying to construct models, solve algebra, and draw and interpret diagrams yourself really helps you understand them better and use them 1.9 How to do well Put in the work Read the handout and the relevant parts of the text (as outlined in this handout) in advance of the lecture, come with questions Handouts and lectures mainly follow the text Do the problem set questions, suggested questions and class questions, understand the answers Do the many practice problems and mock exam questions Care about the content Care about actually understanding this stuff. This will be rewarded. Don’t try to game this. It’s easier to just learn this stuff. Try to achieve Real Understanding: Be able to explain this stuff in your own words (in writing) and apply it to new situations Interact and discuss: Peers, Forum, office hours Be careful you know how to interpret the exam instructions correctly, and use your time wisely Skills to hone and build. Your success in this module will depend in large part on building and applying basic maths skills and tools (mainly at the GCSE level), and strong reading/writing/logic abilities. You should build the ability to comprehend and respond carefully and logically to nuanced questions (essay/short answer, solved problem, and multiple choice). These problem will incorporate quantitative reasoning, logic, and the ability to understand and clearly express ideas, to correctly characterise and describe theories and evidence, and to apply learned principles to new situations. تحذير, 警报, การเตือ, चेतावनीน: This last comment is especially relevant for non-native speakers of English. Students in past years often worried a great deal but got very good marks, and showed good understanding 1.10 Fortune Cookie Wisdom Here are some broad Lessons that I hope you take away from this module, And that will help you throughout… I will come back to these. It may seem like we have the answers, but this is only where we have asked the questions very carefully But sometimes ignorance is bliss. Examples: Sunk-cost fallacy, gains to trade/comparative advantage, opportunity cost, free-riding/prisoners’ dilemma, double-marginalization,‘raise price to raise profit’, etc. I’ve had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife. Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out. We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a ‘single representative consumer’. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights. However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or testing these models, be careful; people may differ and they may change and they may have multiple motives. Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets \\(\\rightarrow\\) opportunities. I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse. I’m not telling you what you need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics. As I also mentioned, these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks. Here are some possible examples. Imperfection: Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘All you can eat’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for ‘all-you-can-eat’ And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later. Free-riding on public goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) Disneyworld, resorts We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride. They then charge an admission fee to ‘be inside of Disney World’ and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods.3 Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Uber, AirBnb Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves). Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Tinder Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high. A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit. If you’re interested, see my research on this here, presentation slides here, my research page is here. Asymmetric information, adverse selection \\(\\rightarrow\\) NHS, ‘Obamacare’ This one is a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA. Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later). There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance ( or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well. Adv: Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you ‘outsource’ And when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do? Much of this work has tried to specify more and more general conditions for this, requiring less and less stringent assumptions.↩ For a different approach see ‘radical xchange’ (sp?), Blockchain and Robert Wiblin 80000 hours podcast episode 63,interview with Vitalik Buterin.↩ "],
["models.html", "2 Economic Models (L1-2) 2.1 What is Economics? 2.2 Why learn these models? 2.3 Economic Models 2.4 Applications 2.5 Basic Supply-Demand Model 2.6 How Economists ‘Verify’ (or Assess) Theoretical Models 2.7 Positive and normative Review questions and problems from NS Chapter 1", " 2 Economic Models (L1-2) – Content largely aligns with Nicholson/Snyder Chapter 1: Economic Models – It also aligns with much of chapters 1-2 of the free text by Curtis and Irvine 2.1 What is Economics? Note: DR: It has changed. There are different views. Ask two economists, and you’ll probably get at least three answers. “Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.” “Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” Alfred Marshall Note: The first quote suggests an approach (how we do our research), the second suggests a domain (what we focus on). Note: “Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.” Ludwig von Mises 2.1.1 What is Microeconomics? The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets. Largely, using theoretical and mathematical ‘models’ that depend on strong assumptions. Comprehension Q: Consider some examples of ‘relevant choices’ for economic study. Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications. A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and ‘general’; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications. 2.2 Why learn these models? Consider the parable of the tortoise and the hare (Aesop)… Figure 2.1: Hopelessly unrealistic and useless? One might question the realism of this story: Can hares really speak? Is this a rabbit or a hare? What other animals were racing? Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above questions? The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models. Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop’s fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of ‘Ceteris paribus’ (all other things being equal) can help us here. What do models give us? There are different views of this Via logic and mathematics: Assumptions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Results and sometimes these also yield testable predictions (if the assumptions hold) Adv: When considering and evaluating these models, you can critique only the assumptions; the results are logically/mathematically proven although when the results contradict real-world evidence this hints that the assumptions may be substantially wrong. Do these simplified models yield conclusions that are relevant to the more complicated real world? Maybe, and sometimes. We will consider the evidence. So why learn these models? A starting point (Sometimes) make concrete predictions you can test Building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking Discussion is framed around them and they are seen as a ‘baseline’ Understand the arguments and models to be able to effectively critique or extend them Some critics of what they call ‘neoliberal economics’ can be misinformed about what it is. Their criticism can sound to us mainstream economists like someone who says ‘cars are dangerous and should be banned because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping’ 2.3 Economic Models Economic model: Simple theoretical description that captures the essentials of how the economy works.4 2.3.1 The PPF: a ‘model’ and a way of seeing things NS ‘A few basic principles’ CM 1.4-1.5 The “production possibility frontier” (PPF) illustrates all the combinations of two (or more) goods that can be produced … by a firm, a family, an economy, globally, etc. Each point is a combination of the amount of the ‘x-axis’ and ‘y-axis’ good. All points on or below the curve are achievable; all points above cannot be produced. Figure 2.2: source: tutor2u Figure 2.2: source: tutor2u Figure 2.2: source: tutor2u Above, we see a depiction of the PPF, the concept of diminishing marginal return, and the concept of inefficiency (from tutor2u.)5 You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced. I’m not sure if I would call it a ‘model’, but it certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions. This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now. Note: For comprehension: Draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means. See fig 1.1 Advanced: Consider … what assumptions does the PPF (implicitly) make? PPF illustrates key principles Principle 1: Scarce Resources Principle 2: Scarcity involves opportunity cost.6 Notes: ‘’The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it.’’(NS, 2011) ‘Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative forgone in making any choice.’ PRUM, chapter 1, section ‘Opportunity Cost’ The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone ‘next best’ opportunity from a choice. I may just call this ‘cost’ Comprehension question (advanced): Think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the ‘cost’ and the economists’ definition of an ‘opportunity cost’ On the PPF the opportunity cost of more clothing is less food. Principle 3: Opportunity costs are (often) increasing. What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases. To produce more and more clothing you would have to give up increasing amounts of food. The “law” of diminishing marginal returns. I’m somewhat sceptical of this being a ‘law’; there are certainly increasing returns in certain regions. However, you will see it again and again as it is a fairly standard assumption. You should read and consider these applications on your own. They will show how the economic principles and theory can be applied to the real-world and test and improve your understanding of the theory. 2.4 Applications 2.4.1 Application 1.1: Economics in the Natural world (NS) The NS textbook presents many interesting applications. These offer you the opportunity to test your knowledge and understanding and apply it to real-world situations. These can also be helpful on assessments; applications may come up, and it may be useful to refer to these and supporting your points on free answer questions. Studies of honeybees have found that they generally do not gather all of the nectar in a particular flower before moving on. (NS) Why not? Adv: What key features do modern human economies have that ‘animal economies’ don’t have? Largely: trade, prices, specialisation, free choice vs instinct. The economics of trade may also apply to the natural world in certain ways. Adv: Above, we see the working of ant-aphid symbiosis, a form of mutualism. Relevant to the ‘conditions necessary for trade to occur’? The ants ‘farm’ the aphids, who secrete nice substances. In return the ants protect the aphids and only sometimes eat them. 2.4.2 Is university worth the time and money The NS text has an application “Is It Worth Your Time to Be Here?” This is a contentious issue, especially in the USA, where private university tuitions run at over £40,000 per year (for a four-year course!) There is constant popular discussion of this. See, e.g., … Please stop asking whether college is worth it Is your university degree barely worth the paper it’s written on? Discuss The case against education, Bryan Caplan; LSE review Consider: Social vs private returns. Is there a case for ‘market failure’? NS Application 1.3: Rise and Fall of Blockbuster link Critical contemporary business challenge: (Note NS edition 12 is updated and discusses Netflix, etc) Blockbuster and Netflix are selling what we call information goods. These have a zero marginal (distribution) cost. They are competing with online merchants. This is characteristic of many things ‘online’ In a turnabout in policy, Blockbuster agreed to give the studios a substantial share (as much as 40 percent) of the revenues from its movie rentals in exchange for price reductions of up to 90 percent. (NS, application 1.3) (Why) was this a good business move? Was it efficient from a social point of view? 2.5 Basic Supply-Demand Model …Describes how a good’s price and the quantity exchanged are determined Determined by the preferences, behaviour, and costs of potential buyers and sellers Note: in 2019 we will not be covering the historical background to the Marshallian cross (the demand and supply you may be familiar with). However, I do expect you to understand this model itself. 2.5.1 Marshall’s Model of Supply and Demand Economists and philosophers have long sought to explain ‘what determines the prices, and why do they change the way they do?’ In the 19th century UK prices were falling while quantities were increasing; this was a puzzle. Alfred Marshall argued that a good’s price must equal both the cost to produce and the value (to consumers) of the last unit produced and consumed. He introduced the ‘demand curve’; with a downward slope. This slope was justified by ‘satiation’: for an individual, additional units of a good are usually valued less and less. For example, you might be willing to pay thousands of pounds to be able to access 100 gallons of water rather than no water at all, but if you already have access to a thousand gallons of water, you will not be willing to pay very much for an additional 100 gallons. Furthermore, firms must cater to less and less keen consumers as they wants to sell more and more units. We come back to this later in the module. ‘Willingness to pay’ (wtp) becomes less and less for the next unit purchased, so will buy more only at a lower price. Equivalently, at a lower price more people find the value exceeds the price, and for additional units. Note that we will also return to these questions in more depth in later chapters as we build up the demand and supply curves. Imagine ‘quantity supplied as a function of price’: \\(Q^s(p)\\) and ‘quantity supplied as a function of price’: \\(Q^d(p)\\). With ‘single crossing’ (a fancy condition you can ignore in this module) there is a unique price where \\(Q^s(p)=Q^d(p)\\), and a unique quantity where the value of the “last unit purchased” … the lowest value any consumer puts on any unit he/she buys … equals its cost to produce, … and this will be the prevailing price. (These ideas will be further elaborated in later lectures.) Cost and value example Imagine one consumer and one producer. Units 1-5 of some product (say, hats) have a value to each consumer (of that unit, add up to get total value of units purchased) stated below, in terms of the ‘other good’, say food. (You can imagine food costs one per unit.) The consumer is willing to give up 5 units of food to gain 1 hat, 4 more units of food to gain the second hat, et. Hats 1-5 have a production cost stated below (in the same units). The producer is can make the first hat at cost 1, the second hat at cost 2, etc. Unit X Value to consumer Cost to produce 1 5 0.5 2 4 1 3 2 2 4 1 3 5 0 4 At each potential price, how many units is the consumer willing to buy? At each potential price, how many units is the producer willing to make/sell? This will imply an individual ‘demand curve’ and ‘supply curve’ for the consumer and producer – can you draw it? What price is ‘equilibrium’, i.e., at what price will the consumer and producer be willing to buy/sell the same amount?7 At this price (2), notice that the value the consumer places on the ‘last unit’ purchased (the third unit, one yielding the lowest value that he still buys) is equal to the cost of producing this unit, 2 in each case. This is not a coincidence. It also hints at the efficiency of the equilibrium price. If, at some price the amount a consumer valued an additional unit was less than the cost of production, and that unit were not produced, then we could make both parties, so such an outcome would not be efficient! If, at some price the amount a consumer valued the last unit was greater so such an outcome would not be efficient either Only where these are equal do we have an efficient level of production/consumption. We will return to this later. Scissors analogy The equilibrium model is analogised to a pair of scissors; neither scis cuts alone So don’t ask ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged’? Understand why ‘Just like neither scis cuts alone, neither the supply nor the demand curve determines the equilibrium price and quantity in isolation’? Adv: Consider: What does it mean to be at equilibrium, and how do we get there? Draw: the famous Marshallian cross Can you explain? The inefficiency of any price other than where \\(Q^D(p)=Q^S(p)\\)? If the price was set at a different value, what forces might push it to the equilibrium? Suggested ans: To economists, a ‘shortage’ is where, at the prevailing or imposed price, consumers are willing to buy more than is available. Some consumers get value from the good in excess of the price. In such a case, firms might offer a higher price, or sellers might ask for a higher price. The price rise would reduce quantity demanded (not ‘reduce demand’) and increase quantity supplied (not ‘reduce supply’). Harder question: Who gains or suffers with a government-imposed price floor/ceiling? To respect yourself in the morning, you must know (as discussed in the NS textbook) Which factors cause the supply and demand curves to shift? What causes ‘movements along’ the supply or demand curve? Note: Caveat, to avoid later confusion: These models assume ‘price-taking’; neither buyers nor sellers consider the impact of their choices on prices Do US, EU, and Japanese farm subsidies help or hurt Africans in net? This is discussed in NS application 1.4 (Economics According to Bono) as well as in an academic article ‘The Impact of Agricultural Subsidies on Global Welfare’: Developing countries strongly oppose domestic and export subsidies by developed countries. Since developing countries cannot afford to support their producers at the levels of developed countries, subsidies tend to limit fair competition. In general, both domestic and export subsidies distort production patterns. Some argue that subsidies given to produc- ers in developed countries have resulted in overproduction and lower world prices of agricultural goods, which have been harmful to agriculture in developing countries. Others have argued that although subsidies distort trade flows, they have been beneficial for consumers in both exporting and importing countries, resulting in a net increase in global welfare, especially in developing importing countries (Bhagwati 2004). This is mainly because subsidies lower world prices for agricultural goods (Koo and Kennedy, 2006)8 This will be skipped in lecture, but please read it; it may come up on an exam. Think about: what do we mean ‘in net’? No obvious theoretical or empirical answers Microeconomic theory helps us consider it, and look for answers Should hurt African farmers Should help African consumers … Which effect dominates (change in African profit less change in African consumer surplus)? … Note: Fig. 1 in NS text depicts African supply/demand mapped against world price 2.6 How Economists ‘Verify’ (or Assess) Theoretical Models This will be skipped in lecture, but we will come back to some of these ideas later. Two methods: Testing Assumptions ‘Verifying’ economic models by examining validity of assumptions upon which models are based. Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.? Notes…[DR: ‘Verifying’ is a bit too black and white’; all models have limitations.],[The NS text is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions. However, there are many cases in which the predictions of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms. On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as ‘constant relative risk aversion’ or ‘geometric discounting’ can be very credibly tested. We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure ‘how close’ behavior is to the assumption.] Testing Predictions Verifying economic models by asking whether models can accurately predict real-world events. If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid. DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general. 2.7 Positive and normative What’s the difference between the following two statements? ‘An increase in the minimum wage leads to greater unemployment.’ ‘We should reduce the minimum wage, to lessen unemployment’ The first is a positive statement: it looks at ‘what is’ The second is a normative statement: it looks at ‘what should be’ ` Notes:,9 10 Review questions and problems from NS Chapter 1 Note: The ‘review questions’ are fundamental, thought-provoking, and challenging; don’t expect an easy answer! Questions/problems I liked from NS are: Q6. ‘Gasoline sells for $4.00 per gallon this year, and it sold for $3.00 per gallon last year. But consumers bought more gasoline this year than they did last year. This is clear proof that the economic theory that people buy less when the price rises is incorrect.’ Do you agree? Explain. Q8. (This one is conceptual and somewhat tricky!) ‘’Housing advocates often claim that ‘‘the demand for affordable housing vastly exceeds the supply. Use a supply-demand diagram to show whether you can make any sense out of this statement. In particular, show how a proper interpretation may depend on precisely how the word affordable is to be defined.’’ Note: Some questions on the above material will be covered in the first problem set and the tutorial; see VLE links. NS, 11th edition, sidebar↩ See site for a further explanation; these topics will also be covered further in this module.↩ From Phillip Heap’s 2010 Powerpoint based on NS↩ The answer is \\(p=2\\). The consumer will buy 3 units, because the first three units have a value at or above 2… (the amount of food he must forgo for each unit). The producer is also willing to produce three units; the first two she can produce at a cost less than 2, and the third unit at a cost of 2.↩ Koo, Won W., and P. Lynn Kennedy. “The impact of agricultural subsidies on global welfare.” American Journal of Agricultural Economics 88, no. 5 (2006): 1219-1226.↩ Adv: Previous versions of this hantour had the first statement as ‘We should increase the minimum wage to help low income workers.’ Consider: why do I think this was not a good parallel?↩ We will mainly focus on positive statements. However, you are not forbidden from making normative statements, and positive results are useful in making normative judgements. But we should try to be clear which type of statement we are making. Still, much economic research has both positive and normative interpretations and implications. Some economists work on ways of clearly defining and quantifying preferences over social outcomes. Others work on determining determining ‘how to optimise’, with implications for which policies and decisions (for individuals, firms, governments, and nonprofits) will be most efficient and effective at attaining particular goals.↩ "],

We will briefly cover the idea of empirical work. We will come back to revise this somewhat (in lecture and tutorials) as we apply these maths concepts. Goals of this material: (Re)-aquaint you with some of maths tools we will use without scaring you Give a flavour of what empirical microeconomics is and you a sense of some of the key issues in empirical work Covers: NS Chapter 1a: Mathematics used in Microeconomics Similar coverage in other (free and online) texts I give a ‘calculus for dummies’ below to make this clearer The math is here to help you, don’t let it scare you, and don’t worry if you don’t understand everything; we will cover it again in context. Do: Understand what the math is and how to use it. Don’t worry about memorizing ‘cookbook rules’ that can be easily looked up. 3.1 Other maths resources I am ‘curating’ some materials to help you revise the maths if you are having some difficulties there. Firstly, note that the Nicholson and Snyder text has a very relevant and useful appendix 2 chapter 1 specifically covering the most important maths; I have also echoed these in the handout. I covered it in some previous years (can you view the recap HERE? I covered it from minute 31, about), but it didn’t seem so helpful to try to cram all of this into a lecture, so I stopped doing it. Warwick maths notes The University of Warwick put up some decent ‘refresher notes’ for incoming economic students. I’ve re-hosted these on my Dropbox, with some comments on which parts are more relevant. (And remember, with a free dropbox account you can add comments and questions directly on these files which I will try to respond to). WW notes 1? WW notes?2 WW notes 3 (Less relevant: WW notes 4?) WW notes 5: the “inequalities” stuff is relevant? WW notes 1 WW notes 2 WW notes 3 Less relevant: WW notes 4 WW notes 5: the “inequalities” stuff is relevant Khan A very good resource for maths learning/revision: The Khan academy has really great well-designed course materials including videos and all sorts of interactive resources.really, I think this is the best place to learn this stuff! Khan academy: , e.g., see their introduction to differential calculus. Some Khan courses/sections I would recommend in particular Pre-algebra (you should know all of this) Algebra basics (all of this) Algebra I (nearly all of this is relevant, accepting a few things like irrational numbers) Algebra II (‘Functions’ and possibly a few other parts) Statistics (mainly just ‘discrete random variables’; especially the ‘mean’) Helpful: Calculus as ‘rates of change’; just the basic concept of a derivative 3.2 Simple stuff Please note: if this depiction is too abbreviated, please consult the NS text, or the Khan academy and Warwick resources mentioned above! I expect to cover this in the second lecture (Univariate) Function A ‘map’ from one or more variables (\\(x\\)) (or ‘variables’) to an outcome (\\(y=f(x)\\)) for each value of \\(x\\) the function tells you a single value of \\(f(x)\\); typically we assign \\(y=f(x)\\) Note: ‘Variables’ are more formally called the ‘arguments’ of a function Linear function A function of the form \\(y=a+bX\\); e.g., \\(y = f(x) = -10 + 3x\\) Plotted as a straight line; intercept \\(a\\), constant slope \\(b\\) (Technically this is an ‘affine’ function; a linear function doesn’t have an intercept) Adv, Maths: For strictly linear functions (not including functions with constants) \\(f(a X_1 + b X_2) = a f(X_1) + b f(X_2)\\) for any values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) In particular ‘the function of the average is the average of the functions’ (this also holds for affine functions). This does not hold in general for nonlinear functions. Slope of \\(y = f(x)\\) The change in y for a given change in x. ‘Rise over run’. Arc slope: slope over a range Point slope: slope of the tangent to a curve at a point Nonlinear (univariate) function : A function \\(f(x)\\) of a form other than \\(f(x) = y=a+bX\\); E.g., a quadratic function \\(y = f(x) = a + bx + cx^2\\) E,g, \\(y = f(x) = 10 - 2x + 3x^2\\) Or a logarithmic \\(y=ln(x)\\) or exponential function \\(y = exp(x)\\) Note: I will try to limit things to linear and quadratic functions, and possibly exponential and log functions. I will remind you of the rules for dealing with these whenever it is necessary. For linear functions the slope is the same at any point. For nonlinear functions it may differ at each point. Think of the slope of a mountain versus the slope of a wheelchair ramp. Consider the original values of \\(x\\) -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 Now consider the linear function \\(y = f(x) = 3+2x\\). Applying this function to these values yields -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Now consider the quadratic function \\(y = g(x) = -x^2+15x\\). Applying this function to these values yields -54, -34, -16, 0, 14, 26, 36. Putting this all together: A linear function: 2+2x A quadratic function: -x^2+10x x y=f(x) y=g(x) -3 -4 -39 -2 -2 -24 -1 0 -11 0 2 0 1 4 9 2 6 16 3 8 21 The point here is that increasing X by 1 has the same effect on Y wherever you start, for a linear function but a different effect depending on where you start for a nonlinear function Instantaneous rate of change (instantaneous slope) The slope of the line tangent to the curve at a single point Adv, Math: This is the limit of the ‘rise over run’ as the run goes to zero Convex function: Slope everywhere increasing, unique minimum where slope \\(=0\\) Concave function: Slope everywhere decreasing, unique maximum where slope \\(=0\\) Note: we are referring to the signed value of the slope here, not the absolute value. E.g., for the convex case depicted, it goes from a negative slope to a zero slope to a positive slope For these functions the slope is different at each point. Note: We will mainly deal with functions like these, with a single minimum or maximum that occurs at the unique point with slope zero. Quadratic function are convex if the \\(x^2\\) term has a positive sign and concave if it has a negative sign. That’s because at extreme values of x the term with the largest exponent will dominate all other terms. Example of a convex function: Tiger’s golf earnings per game as function of hours of golf retraining… he had to get worse before he could get better, they say. Or cost per smoothie as function of employees behind smoothie counter. One example of a concave function: how funny I am as function of beers I drink (on the other hand, how funny I think I am may be an everywhere increasing function. Derivative of a function A derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) is another function called \\(f&#39;(x)\\). \\(f&#39;(x)\\) tells us the slope of the function \\(f(x)\\) at any point \\(x\\). For example, the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2\\) For this linear function the slope is a constant, 2 We will come back to the following examples later. E.g., the derivative of the quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2x - 4\\) derivative of the quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2x - 4\\) E.g., the slope at \\(x=1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x;x=1) = 2\\times 1 - 4 = -2\\) The slope is zero where \\(f&#39;(x)=2x-4=0\\), or where \\(x=2\\) Is \\(x=2\\) at a min, a max, or neither? How do we know? 3.3 Minimum, maximum, or neither? \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is a function that tells us the slope of \\(f(x)\\), or how \\(f(x)\\) changes in \\(x\\) at any point \\(x\\) In turn, the derivative of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is called \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\). This tells us how the slope changes as \\(x\\) increases Oversimplifying a bit: (Adv, Math: Essentially, for a class of functions where the domain is not bounded) if the slope is always increasing, i.e., if \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) everywhere, the function is convex (u-shaped), and has a single minimum where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) if the slope is always decreasing, i.e., if \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) everywhere, the function is concave (inverse-u-shaped), and has a single maximum where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) 3.4 Functions of two or more variables (multivariate functions) Utility, profit, cost, production, returns, etc. May depend on multiple variables/inputs Need to illustrate tradeoffs between these \\[y=f(x,z)\\] \\(y\\) may increase and/or decrease in \\(x\\) and in \\(z\\) The rate of increase of y in \\(x\\) may depend on the values of \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) Similar for the rate of increase of y in z E.g., \\[y=\\sqrt(xz) = x^{1/2}z^{1/2}, x \\geq 0, z \\geq 0\\] Note the outcome will increase in each argument at a decreasing rate. What does it look like? 3d: project up to y from a “map” of x and z coordinates on the desk. This is hard to picture; ‘contour lines’ can help. Projecting a function up from X,Y space into the Z axis: 3.5 Contour lines (we will come back to this later) Contour lines Level sets - depict combinations of variables that hold the function constant at a particular value f(x,z) = A for some value \\(A\\) Level sets: E.g., indifference curves, isoquants and isocost curves. Don’t worry if you find this discussion of level sets confusing. We will come back to it later in the module for a more specific case. Note: It is difficult to depict more than 2 dimensions on a piece of paper. So we find the values for the 2 variables that give us a particular value for the third … which tells us how these trade off. Consider a production function: \\[Y = f(K,L) = \\sqrt(KL)\\] Setting this equal to 1 we can map out ‘all combinations of K and L that produce output \\(Y=1\\)’. We do this by solving for the amount of K needed to produce 1 as a function of L and then plotting this against a range of L \\[ Y = \\sqrt(KL) = 1 \\rightarrow KL = 1 \\] \\[ \\rightarrow K = 1/L \\] Setting this at Y = 2 \\[ Y = \\sqrt(KL) = 2 \\rightarrow KL = 4 \\] \\[ \\rightarrow K = 4/L \\] Let’s see the value of this function for some random combinations of K and L: K &lt;- rep(c(1,2,3,4), each = 4) L &lt;- rep(c(1,2,3,4), times=4) y &lt;- sqrt(K*L) contour_ex &lt;- hux(data.frame(K,L,y)) %&gt;% huxtable::add_colnames() %&gt;% theme_plain #knitr::include_graphics(&quot;contourcombos.png&quot;) For values of K 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4 and L 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 we have the values of \\(y=\\sqrt(K\\times L)\\): K L y 1 1 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 2 1.41 1 3 1.73 1 4 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 1 1.41 2 2 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 3 2.45 2 4 2.83 3 1 1.73 3 2 2.45 3 3 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 4 3.46 4 1 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 2 2.83 4 3 3.46 4 4 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that different combinations of K and L yield the same Y. E.g., in the above table we see three distinct pairs of K and L yielding Y=2. We can consider ’what combinations of values of this function yield a particular value? Connect values of K and L that lead to the same value of y yields ‘level sets’ or ‘contour lines’. Below, we plot all combinations of X and Z that satisfy \\(Y = \\sqrt(XZ)\\), for three values of Y: Y=1, Y=2, and Y=3. eq = function(x){1/x} eq2 = function(x){2/x} eq3 = function(x){3/x} ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 3)), aes(x=x)) + stat_function(fun=eq, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(colour = &quot;Y=1&quot;)) + stat_function(fun=eq2, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(colour = &quot;Y=2&quot;)) + stat_function(fun=eq3, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(colour = &quot;Y=3&quot;)) + xlab(&quot;X&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Z&quot;) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,3)) Figure 3.1: contour lines for Y = sqrt(XZ) 3.6 Simultaneous equations As shown above, the pair of equations \\[ y =-x+7 \\] \\[ y=2x+1 \\] holds only where \\(x=2\\) and \\(y=5\\).11 Another example \\[ X + Y = 3 \\] \\[ X - Y = 1 \\] Holds only where \\(X=2, Y=1\\), the ‘unique solution’ Note: Be sure you know how to solve the above. Adv math: Note, in general, we need as many equations as unknowns (above 2 of each) to possibly be able to find a solution. However, some sets of equations have no solution, and some may have multiple solutions. Consider plotting overlapping lines, or parrallel lines, and looking for the point(s) of intersection. It is meaningless to ask ‘how does a change in X affect Y?’ in the above context. Equally meaningless: ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged?’ in a demand-supply Marshallian cross. 3.7 Empirical microeconomics/econometrics Empirical research Uses evidence from the real world, i.e., observation, to answer questions (rather than introspection and theory) Econometrics The ‘science’ of using data to answer economic questions Uses statistical tools and often economic theory Micro-data Data where the unit of observation is an individual, household, firm, etc. (Contrasts from macro-data, data on aggregates like GDP, inflation, etc.) See, e.g., Euro-stat microdata Data on individual donations (at the donor level) from a large scale field experiment (Karlan and List) downloadable HERE Price and product data on gluten-free bread at the supermarket level ‘Macro-data’ This is contrasted from ‘Macro-data’ which is aggregated/averaged in some way (e.g., at the country-level or industry-level) E.g., Computer penetration and income by year and Chinese province Suicide, mental health, and GDP by country and year Adv: Econometrics often has a different focus and different methodology than ‘regular statistics’. Econometrics has taken on a larger role in economics over the past 40 years, because of greater data availability and computing power. Most published papers in economics now involve some econometric analysis. 3.8 Empirical meta-example (A bit advanced) Suppose we are trying to estimate the market demand curve; suppose we hypothesize that this demand curve is a linear function. (I.e., suppose we assume that quantity demanded is a linear function of price). \\[Q_d = a-bp\\] Suppose we know that price is changing because of cost changes, shifts in supply curve, or the firm experimenting Adv: Otherwise the problem is poorly identified, as demand and supply will jointly determine price We observe price and quantity data for a period where ceteris paribus is reasonable, such as the data below12 We try to fit the ‘best’ line through these points (minimizing the distances between the line and the points, or minimizing the ‘error’ of this predicted quantity) We estimate the demand curve’s slope and intercept. We can use this to make inferences. This line will never fit exactly, because of unobserved differences, nonlinear demand, measurement error, randomness in behaviour. But this fitted line is only meaningful if we are observing shifts in the supply curve and not the demand curve! (Can you explain why?) Ceteris paribus All [most] economic theories employ the assumption that ‘other things are held constant.’ In above data/figure, demand may differ between weeks/stores, weather may change, etc. ‘the points may lie on several different demand curves, and attempting to force them into a single curve would be a mistake.’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) We would like to carefully ‘control’ for other observable factors Adv: May also use flexible functions permitting heterogeneity – differing slopes. We can never control for everything or know ‘true’ functional forms. Sadly, all empirical work involves imperfect compromises. But happily there are ways to test and validate the estimates, e.g., see how well they predict future outcomes. 3.9 Changing world oil prices NS application 1A.3 in NS, also discussed in PRUM section 4.1. This will be probably skipped in lecture, but please read it. This may be referred to in problem sets/tutorials. This is a great example from perhaps the most important unified global market, with tremendous fluctuations that have huge impacts. It shows the power of empirical microeconomics. (Note edition 12 updates.) Henceforth we will refer to: gg - the market demand curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as \\(Q_D(P,...)\\) and - the market supply curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as \\(Q_S(P,...)\\). The quantity (units of a good) that firms in the market are willing to supply is a function of the price and other ‘background’ things. The total quantity that consumers in the market or willing to demand is a different function of the price of other things. We typically these ‘supply curve’, and ‘demand curve’, respectively, but I want to to think of these as functions that can shift. I don’t want you to write ‘demand went down’; that is ambiguous. The price where these quantities are equal is the ‘prevailing price in the market’. We build this up throughout the next sections in more detail. Getting back to the example… Empirical work has estimated the equations below, the estimated supply and demand curves expressed in dollars and millions of barrels, from an earlier period: \\[ Q_D = 85 - 0.4P \\: (D) \\] \\[ Q_S = 55 + 0.6P \\: (S) \\] Setting \\(Q_S=Q_D\\) and solving this yields: \\(85 - 0.4P=55+0.6P \\rightarrow P = 30, Q = 73\\) Note: This is the sort of simultaneous equation you should be able to solve. This approximates the 2000-2002 price So what accounted for price rise in 2008 to about US$130, and then fall to US$50 by March 2009? China and India’s economy grew, implying a growth in the world economy by 3-4% per year Various calculations imply that this represents a shifting out in the Demand curve from \\(Q_D = 85 - 0.4P\\) to: \\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\\] Side note: I think the ‘new demand’ curve comes from an approximation: if the world economy grew at 4% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it’s previous size. … thus the growth is \\(1.047^7=1.316\\). They assume oil’s demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112. Note that the text has a typo: equation 3 on page 40, the new demand, should read \\(Q=112-0.4P\\). With the same supply curve and the new demand curve we have \\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\\] \\[Q_S = 55 + 0.6P\\] This \\(\\rightarrow\\) solves to \\(P=57, Q=87\\) Furthermore, overall price inflation, US$ devaluation \\(\\rightarrow\\) accounts for about a price of US$94 So why was did the price move to $130? Other changes included: Speculation, other disruptions. Supply may have also shifted (political turmoil, new sources of energy, etc.) Do you know the current price of oil per barrel in USD and GBP? 3.10 Data and economic analysis (Curtis and Irvine) (Source: xkcd.com) Please read from Microeconomics - markets, methods and models by Curtis and Irvine sections 2.2 (you can skip ‘index numbers’ for now if you like) section 2.3 I suggest you read a bit in general about: How and when economists infer ‘causal relationships’ How and when Economists attempt to estimate supply and demand curves, and features of these systems 3.11 Between first and second week; priority home-study Make sure you are following along. Can you answer the questions mentioned above and in the lecture? E.g., can you explain why (supply) demand curves slope (upwards) downwards? Can you solve a system of two equations (supply, demand) for an equilibrium price and quantity? What causes shifts versus movements along the demand curve? Do you know what ‘micro-data is’? Would you be able to identify it if you saw it? At this point, you should be able to do problem set 1. Please do at least get a start on it. After week 1, before week 2 lectures, be sure you have read/understood all of the ‘handout’ and corresponding material up to this point. To prepare for the week 2 lectures, you should look ahead at the readings and handout material (below). In particular, read and consider the material on ‘preference axioms’, ‘utility functions’, and how the latter are depicted using indifference curves. These are difficult and somewhat abstract concepts; try to test your understanding and bring questions (or ask these on the VLE or in this text with hypothes.is)! If you have time, please also start considering the budget constraints and conditions for consumer optimisation. In particular, the ‘bang for the buck’ condition is something you will want to look at closely to get your head around it.

Reinstein, David. “The Economics of the Gift.” (2014). Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study) Understand what ‘utility’ is and how is it defined and modeled Understand the assumptions economists usually make about preferences (choices) and their implications Learn how to depict preferences and utility with ‘indifference curves’ and how to interpret these … with examples like ‘perfect substitutes’ and ‘perfect complements’ Learn what ‘budget constraints’ are and how to compute and model them Understand ‘maximising utility subject to constraints’ and the conditions for optimisation involving price ratios and marginal rates of substitution Learn how to depict this optimisation in a graph with indifference curves and budget constraints …and how to interpret this graph 4.2 Preamble to utility and choice We now consider the very very fundamental building blocks behind the (in)famous ‘neoclassical economics model.’ If you accept these ‘axioms’ nearly everything flows from it! 4.3 Some motivation for these abstract ideas Consider a decision you recently made? Define this decision clearly; what were the options? How do you think you decided among these options? What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the same decision? If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same situation again. Do you think you’d make the same decision? Suppose I asked you: ‘State a rule that governs how people do make decisions’… I want this rule to be both Informative (it rules out at least some sets of choices) and Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule). Suppose I asked an apparently similar question: ‘State a rule that governs how people should make decisions’.. By ‘should’ I mean that they will not regret having made decisions in this way. If people did follow these rules, what would this imply and predict? Economists (and decision theorists/decision scientists) have specifically defined such rules in terms of ‘axioms about preferences’ They have started from these ‘reasonable axioms’ and followed their logical implications for individual choices, individual responses to changes in prices and income, market prices and quantities and their responses, ‘welfare’ and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc. The ‘Standard axioms’ (imply that) choices can be expressed by ‘individuals maximising utility functions subject to their budget constraints’. This yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc. Note: Part 2 (NS ch 2-3) involves building the demand curve from first principles, and discussing how to interpret it We want to develop a model that can be used to show how we make choices or decisions. In the (neo) classical economics framework, your (optimising) choices are determined by two things: Preferences: what goods do you like? Constraints: how much money do you have, what are the prices of the goods you buy? Second problem set, first part (NS chapter 2): Preferences, Utility, Consumer optimization, individual and market demand 4.4 Utility Utility “The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity.” Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions Adv: There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature Adv: A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated, thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, ‘utility’, which is maximised. 4.5 Utility from two goods We may specify a “utility function” of two goods (or aggregations of goods) \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\): \\[Utility = U(X,Y; other)\\] We can get a lot of insight from considering models Of an individual’s preferences over only two goods. These two ‘goods’ could represent, for example: Leisure and ‘goods consumption’ Food and non-food Coffee and tea (holding all else constant) Maths revision: \\(U(X,Y)\\) expresses a function with two arguments, X and Y. At this point, you may want to return to the revision material covering functions of two or more variables. Math-multivariate functions \\(U(X,Y)\\) must take some value for every positive value of X and Y. In general a function of X and Y might increase or decrease in either X or Y, or increase over some ranges and decrease over other ranges of these two arguments. For example, consider the function ‘altitude of land in Britain as a function of degrees longitude and latitude’. \\(U(X,Y)\\) expresses a general function; I haven’t specified what this function is. E.g., it could be \\(U(X,Y)=\\sqrt(XY)\\). 4.6 Measuring and comparing utilities Adv: This is a difficult but well-studied issue, as it is important for methodology and welfare analysis. In more detailed discussions, we might speak of ‘cardinal utility’, ‘ordinal utility’, etc., to indicate the ways we can or cannot compare utility between individuals and in response to policy changes. Utility is not ‘observable and measurable in utils’ Utility is seen to govern an individual’s choices and thus it’s only inferred indirectly, from the choices people make Who gets ‘more’ utility? We don’t know. Also, considering a transfer from Al to Betty: Is the reduction in Al’s utility more or less than the increase in Betty’s? Revealed preference: if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a dog was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat. As we only get at utility through an individual’s decisions, we have no reliable way to compare it across individuals. 4.7 Assumptions about preferences (‘axioms’) Completeness: Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive. Transitivity (internal consistency): If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C. More is Better (nonsatiation) 1. Completeness The following is forbidden: “I cannot choose between a ski holiday and a beach holiday, yet I am not indifferent between these.” Why wouldn’t I be able to express a preference? In the case above that seems strange, but for other cases it may be extremely difficult or painful to make a choice, or very hard to compare two things. Imagine if you were asked to choose between never seeing your mother or never seeing your father. In general, economists’ standard approach assumes we have a consistent preference ranking over all possibilities, and choose accordingly. Other social sciences see this differently/ Also ‘forbidden’ in the classical model: the time or frame in which I make the decisions must not affect my choices. This will be relaxed when we discuss behavioral economics. Fancy notation: Either A preferred to B, B preferred to A, or A indifferent to B \\[A \\succ B, B \\succ A, \\: or \\: A \\sim B \\] You don’t have to know this notation, but it may be a helpful shorthand 2. Transitivity \\[ A \\succ B \\: and \\: B \\succ C \\rightarrow A \\succ C \\] Similar for indifference (\\(\\sim\\)) If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer an Apple to a Cherry. If this seems confusing it may be because it is too obvious (although behavioral and experimental economists claim to find violations of this. … this obviously extends to ‘chains’ combining these … so \\[ A \\succ B \\:\\: and \\: \\: B \\sim C \\rightarrow A \\succ C \\] etc. We may write this concisely as \\(A \\succ B \\sim C\\). Adv: If you found someone who stricly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them! In more detail… Intuitively: Transitive preferences are ‘internally consistent’: If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C. Loosely, I might expect this if I think that a person has preferences that can be ranked in a normal way. The standard ‘utility framework’ takes this for granted. If we have any rule over preference such as ‘more is better’ or ‘tastier is better’, this should hold. Also, someone whose makes choices following preferences that are not transitive may quickly be impoverished by a shrewd trader. We do not see this happening in general. If you found someone who strictly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them. This is easiest to illustrate if we allow these goods to be non-discrete and assume ‘more is always better.’ It works as follows: Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry. Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of banana (or ‘money’). Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra. Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra. … Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you’ve drained all of their resources. (Final) Exam question: What are ‘transitive preferences’? Give an example of a person making choices that seem to reflect preferences that are extit{not} transitive, and explain how you could ‘pump money’ from this person.13 Check out: Becoming a money pump, Nick Chater, Warwick business school An interesting discussion of ‘money pumps’ (and ‘Dutch books’) in terms of preferences and financial markets. I’ve seen this chocolate beverage argument presented for why people should not have ’wide zones of indifference. 3. More is better (‘global nonsatiation’) Perhaps this seems unreasonable? One way you might justify it: If the product is a ‘bad’ (e.g., pollution), redefine the product as the absence of the product. The darkly shaded area above represents those combinations of X and Y that are unambiguously preferred to the combination X*, Y*. This is why goods are called ‘goods’; individuals prefer having more of any good rather than less. Combinations of X and Y in the lightly shaded area are inferior to the combination \\(X^{\\ast}, Y^{\\ast}\\), whereas those in the questionable areas may or may not be superior to \\(X^{\\ast}, Y^{\\ast}\\). Who cares? If people obey the first two above assumptions/axioms, the completeness and transitivity\\(\\ast\\), they will make choices in a way consistent with maximising a (continuous) utility function. (… OK, maybe you still don’t care, but economists do.) Technical note: Technically, these conditions are necessary but not sufficient. Adding ‘Continuity’ of preferences yields a sufficient condition, and also guarantees continuous utility functions and demand curves without strange jumps). Technical note: Strictly, most results only require ‘local nonsatiation’; starting from any consumption point, increasing the amount of *some good by a tiny \\(\\epsilon\\) amount will yield a preferred point. This will yield results like ‘people will spend all of their wealth’ and ‘(roughly) people will never buy a more expensive bundle when a cheaper bundle is preferred.’ We are not saying people actually consult a utility function. That would be a dumb thing to say. We are considering that ‘people behave as if they are maximizing utility functions’; this is (basically) equivalent to saying \"people choose based on preferences that satisfy the above assumptions. These axioms stand directly behind ‘revealed preference’ methods for measuring how much people value nonmarket goods, like clean air and national parks. It also gives us a vocabulary and a way to test for violations of this consistency, and make alternate predictions. Also…14 How can we compare the “?” areas? Which are preferred? \\(\\rightarrow\\) Compare utilities, depict this using Indifference Curves 4.8 Voluntary trades and indifference curves Indifference curve A curve that shows all the combinations of goods or services that provide the same level of utility. Formally (for 2 goods), the indifference curve is th set of pairs of \\({X,Y}\\) such that \\(U(X,Y)=c\\) for some constant c.15 Autor: Define a level of utility say \\(U(x) = U\\). Then, the indifference curve for U, \\(IC(U)\\) is the locus of consumption bundles that generate utility level U for utility function \\(U(x)\\). Consider the above diagram16 . Think of this as a map with a projection above it. How far East you go on this map determines how much of the x good is consumed How far North you go determines how much of the Y good is consumed. How high is the projected image… Determines how much utility is obtained from this combination of goods X and Y.17 The above diagram also includes color to depict the utility level, like a ‘heat map.’18 You can find further revision of this basic content at Khan Academy Properties of indifference curves Note for above: Suppose you are someone that likes hamburgers and soft drinks. If this is too difficult to imagine, think of two healthy goods, like runner beans and green tea. Note that the period of consumption—a day, a year, or a lifetime—is not specified. Comprehension Q: Rank order of preference between points A-E using the formal notation (Answers to most comprehension questions are given in footnotes. Try to answer it yourself before looking at the footnote.)19 r format_with_col(\"Note: I've asked this as a MCQ on exams!\",\"blue\") Q: How do we know \\(E \\succ B\\) ?20 Q: How do we know \\(E \\succ B\\) ?21 Q: How do we know \\(E \\succ A\\) ?22 Even though these concepts are rather abstract, we can already apply this to an interesting question that has been central to economics throughout history. Why is there ‘voluntary trade’ (between individuals)? This gives us insight into why people trade with one another. Considering figure 2.2 (above and in the NS text), an individual is ok with giving up soda for hamburgers or vice/versa along her indifference curve. A trade that put her above the IC makes her ‘strictly’ better off. So consider if one individual had allocation D and another allocation A, and they had the same preferences. What trade could they make to make each of them better off? Note that the line between two bundles depicts all ‘convex combinations’ of these \\(\\alpha\\) of D and \\(1-\\alpha\\) of A, where \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\). In normal-speak, a partial share of each bundle. We can see that with the same DMRS for both, trades along this line make both better off; the points they would trade to depends on their bargaining power. They might also trade in a way that puts one below this line but still above the original indifference curve. 4.9 Marginal rate of substitution (MRS): Absolute value of slope of indifference curve The MRS measures the maximum amount of one good (\\(Y\\)) that you would be willing to give up in order to gain one more unit of another good (\\(X\\)). I.e., this would be the amount you could give up of \\(Y\\) when you gain one unit of \\(X\\) and be no worse or better off. You are ‘indifferent’ to making this change. Tech note This slope will equal the negative of the ratio of the rate at which utility increases in each good (partial derivative) Intuition: giving up a certain utility from one good must be balanced by an increase in utility from the other good. So the MRS is the ratio itself, because it’s the absolute value.) Formally, the MRS at point \\(X,Y\\), where \\(U(X,Y)=U_1\\) is: \\(MRS(X,Y)=-\\frac{dY}{dX}|U(X,Y)=U_1\\), the absolute value of the total derivative of Y with respect to X, holding utility constant Returning to fig 2.2: Moving from A to B: She is willing to give up 2 burgers to get 1 more soda. \\(\\rightarrow\\) Here the slope \\(-2\\), implying a \\(MRS=2\\)23 From B to C? (think about it) willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1 more soda \\(\\rightarrow MRS =1\\) C to D? \\(MRS = \\frac{1}{2}\\) (Here this refers to ‘arc slopes’, not precisely the slope at points tangent to the curve.)24 Note the decline in the MRS as she gets more hamburgers (and fewer sodas): this ‘diminishing MRS’ is a common assumption… this may reflect satiation; as she gets more and more hamburgers each one adds incrementally less to her utility (because she grows tired of them.) Careful: it is very easy to get the numerator and denominator wrong in computing the MRS. Find a way to remember this for yourself. Preference for variety/balance This ‘preference for variety’ is thought to hold for most combinations of goods, most of the time, but probably not for all pairings25 With an indifference curve with this shape (‘convex’) any consumption bundle that represents a ‘mixture’ between two equally attractive extremes will be preferred to those extremes.26 E.g., if I like bundles A and D equally, I prefer a bundle of 1/3 of A and 2/3 of D to either A or D.27 the X-axis good as one gives up} Indifference curve map Key principles: IC’s never cross, never slope upwards, and have zero thickness 4.10 Illustrating particular preferences N&amp;S give some examples of preference which violate some of the above assumptions and do not exhibit diminishing MRS. Further notes on the above diagram: Smoke grinders are useless: violates ‘more is better’; this good can be ignored. Houseflies are a bad. (But housefly reduction is a good). Two types of petrol: perfect substitutes (at 1:1); no preference for variety. Left and right shoes are perfect complements in 1:1 proportions; no benefit to more of one without the other; consumed in exact proportions. 4.11 App 2.3: Product positioning in marketing (not covered in lecture, read on your own) Preference for balance? (Convex indifference curves)? If market research suggests a broad group indifferent between A and D (in fig 2.3), they may strictly prefer G \\(\\rightarrow\\) a possible niche for a new profitable product What may be a critique, exception to this logic, e.g., for a particular food? Some suggested answers, others are reasonable… Convex preferences, ‘preferring mixtures’ is a very strong assumption, unlikely to hold everywhere, or for actual mixtures. I may be indifferent between liver and custard, but it doesn’t mean that I prefer liver-flavoured custard, nor even necessarily equal amounts of liver and custard side by side. Producing an ‘intermediate’ attribute may be more costly; it may be easy to make crunchy but low-taste cereal or tasty but low-crunch cereal, but expensive to make a cereal with both attributes. E.g., hard to make a car that is spacious and fast. These issues are decently addressed in the most recent edition 12. Utility/indifference curves: Also a framework for marketing analysis The utility and indifference curve construct may seem highly theoretical. Indeed, these models were developed largely to address big questions like ‘who gains from trade?’ Still, it helps organise thinking and analysis for at least some managers and marketing groups. According to the text, Marriot hotel used focus groups to ‘construct (multidimensional) indifference curves’ to consider their ideal product positioning. I have seen a similar presentation for other hotels presented at Behavioural boozeonomics in London.} 4.12 Definitions: Perfect substitutes and complements Perfect substitutes Goods A and B are Perfect Substitutes when an individual’s utility is linear in these goods when she is always willing to trade off A for B at a fixed rate (not necessarily 1 for 1) Perfect complements Goods A and B are Perfect Complements when an individual only gains utility from (more) A if she also consumes a defined (additional) amount of B, and vice-versa These goods are ‘enjoyed only in fixed proportions’. E.g., left and right shoes (1:1) bicycle frames and wheels (1:2) or, perhaps, baking powder and flour (1:40) for someone who only eats soda bread.28 4.13 Choices are subject to constraints You cannot spend more than your (lifetime) income/wealth \\(\\rightarrow\\) budget constraint. Consider the budget constraint given in the figure below. Figure 4.1: Budget constraint for two goods Budget constraint for two goods, slope \\(-P_x/P_y\\) Notes: For example, think ‘food’ and ‘nonfood’. Be careful: it is very easy to get this slope ratio backwards! Budget constraint algebra If I spend all my income (which I should do over a ‘relevant lifetime’), then: Expenditure on X + Expenditure on Y = Income (I) \\[P_X X + P_Y Y = I \\] To see how \\(Y\\) trades off against \\(X\\), rearrange this to: \\[Y = -\\frac{P_X}{P_Y} X + \\frac{I}{P_Y}\\] Intercept: \\(\\frac{I}{P_Y}\\), i.e., amount of Y you can buy if you only buy Y Slope: \\(-\\frac{P_X}{P_Y}\\), i.e., how much Y you must give up to get another unit of X Notes and intuition: The slope \\(-P_X/P_Y\\): How much \\(Y\\) I must sacrifice to get another unit of \\(X\\), expressed as a negative number.29 To get another unit of \\(X\\) it costs me \\(P_xX\\), so the more costly is \\(X\\) the more \\(Y\\) I must give up. For each unit of \\(Y\\) I give up I save \\(P_Y\\), so the more costly is \\(Y\\) the more I can save by giving up 1 unit of it, thus, the less I need to sacrifice of \\(Y\\) to get another unit of \\(X\\). Work on making sure you can calculate the slope and intercept, what they mean, and have intuition for why the slope has this formula. See ‘micro quiz 2.3’) Having trouble understanding the budget constraint computations? There is a great interactive exercise HERE, click on ‘budget constraint’. 4.14 Constrained utility maximization We started with an individual’s preferences, one of the baseline elements of the neoclassical model. Under some conditions these can be described by utility functions, which we depicted graphically as ‘mountains’ with levels sets depicted by indifference curves. So, we have a way of depicting what people prefer, but this doesn’t tell us what people will choose to consume (and firms to produce). We next introduced the second fundamental element of the neoclassical model, constraints, in particular, the budget constraint. We put these together to describe the consumer’s problem: maximizing her utility subject to her budget constraints. this is depicted in figure 2.7 below for the two good case. Imagine that you are this consumer with these preferences and this budget constraint. You can choose any point in the shaded area, as it is on or below your budget constraint. You want to get to the highest indifference curve. Consider: How do we know A is suboptimal (i.e., NOT optimal)? What about B? Points between B and C? We can demonstrate that you will choose point C, yielding utility \\(U_2\\). What is special about point C? It’s the point of tangency between the budget constraint and an indifference curve. It’s also (not a coincidence) the point where the slopes are equal. At this point (but not in general!) we have that “Slope of budget constraint = slope of indifference curve” \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) (implying that)30 \\[P_X/P_Y = MRS\\] Note31 Warning: The above is shorthand; recall that the marginal rate of substitution may vary everywhere along an indifference curve (remember the idea of satiation and diminishing MRS). It is a function of the point it is evaluated, i.e., \\(MRS = MRS(X,Y)\\). It is only at the point where the consumer is optimizing that these slopes must be equal. They can also be equal at some other suboptimal points, where she is not spending all of her income, or if the indifference curves have a shape very different from the one above (more or less, where they are not ‘convex’). Where she is consuming some of every good, this is a necessary condition for such a point to represent an optimal consumption choice, but it may not be a sufficient condition. May also be optimal for her to consume none of certain goods, in which case this condition will not hold. We return to this later. At an optimal consumption choice (given above assumptions, see above footnote) Consume all of income (locate on budget line; follows from ‘more is better’) Psychic tradeoff (MRS) equals market tradeoff (\\(P_X/P_Y\\)) Intuition: If I can give up X for Y in the market (buy less X, get more Y) at a certain rate, and the benefit I get from doing this is at a different rate, I can make myself better off. Thus the original point could not have been optimal! Think about this carefully; it is a key method of proving things in economic theory called ‘proof by contradiction’. Example, for intuition Suppose that at the consumption bundle you choose your MRS = 1. To remain indifferent, you would be willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1 soda. Suppose the price of soda is £1 and the price of a burger is £2. \\(\\rightarrow\\) Price ratio: \\(P_S/P_B = 1/2\\) Thus if you buy one less burger you can buy two more sodas. Thus if you give up one burger, you can get one more soda to keep you indifferent plus an additional soda. This means you would be better off; thus the original bundle wasn’t optimal. Practice question: in which direction would you adjust this bundle if the price of a soda was £2 and a hamburger was £1? Explain. More extended example… E.g., if I can give up one glass of wine and gain two beers (i.e., because wine is twice as costly), and (given my proposed consumption of wine and beer) I get the same value from each glass of wine or beer, I can give up this glass of wine, gain two beers, and make myself ‘one unit’ better off, at the margin. On the other hand, if I can give up one glass of wine and gain two beers (i.e., because wine is twice as costly), and (given my proposed consumption of wine and beer) I get the four times as much value from each glass of wine as each beer, I can give up two beers, gain a wine (which I value at four beers) and make myself ‘two units’ better off, at the margin. However, I can not apply this argument to a point where I am consuming only wine… I cannot consume less than no beer (although some nights I wish I could have done). We return to this point below More insight: Skip if you like This next bit is fairly mathy. It should be helpful but you can skip over it if you don’t find it so. Recall \\(U=U(X,Y)\\). \\[U_X(X,Y) := MU_X(X,Y)\\] Derivative with respect to X: rate that utility increases if we add a little X, holding Y constant Similarly for \\(MU_Y\\). It turns out the MRS at a point is the ratio of these marginal utilities. MRS: ‘how much Y would I be willing to give up to get a unit of X’? Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each … we can show \\(MRS(X,Y)=\\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\\) Mathy intuition: The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point – the higher is \\(MU_X\\) – the more Y I am willing to give up to get it. That is why \\(MU_X\\) is in the numerator. The more valuable a bit more Y is at that point – the higher is \\(MU_Y\\) – the less Y I am willing to give up to get a bit more X. That is why \\(MU_Y\\) is in the denominator. Advanced maths: The derivation of the MRS is optional material. The ‘first order change in utility’ (or ‘total differential’) is: \\[ dU = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X}dX + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Y}dY\\] \\[ = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY\\] Where \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X}\\) refers to the partial derivative of U(X,Y) with respect to X, and similarly for Y, i.e., the marginal utility. Essentially, this approximates the total change in utility for very small changes in X and Y. Setting it equal to zero and rearranging it yields the rate, at the margin, one is willing to give up Y for X: \\[dU = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY = 0 \\] \\[\\frac{dY}{dX}=-\\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\\] Tech note: This is a simple case of the implicit function theorem. Essentially \\(U(X,Y)=c\\) defines an implicit function \\(Y(X)\\), whose slope is the negative of the ratio of the derivatives. Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields more intuition: \\[P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y\\] (at each consumption point X,Y) \\[\\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}.\\] I.e., the same ‘bang for each buck’. Note: If this didn’t hold true and you were spending on both goods, you would be paying ‘more per util’ for one good than the other, and thus should reallocate to that other good. 4.15 Note on ‘corner solutions’ The above applies to any interior solution If you are consuming both goods and optimising, \\(P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y\\) must hold Advanced: This is a ‘necessary but not sufficient condition’, sufficient if there is a diminishing MRS everywhere. But you might consume none of some good (say X): if even with no X, \\(MU_X/P_X&lt;MU_Y/P_Y\\) i.e., the marginal utility of the first unit of X is less than that of Y we will see examples of this (maths and graphically) 32 But you might consume none of some good (say X): if even with no X, \\(MU_X/P_X&lt;MU_Y/P_Y\\) i.e., the marginal utility of the first unit of X is less than that of Y 4.16 App 2.4: ticket scalping Suppose tickets are rationed: one per customer. This constraint (which is additional to the budget constraint) implies lower utility; the individual depicted above would choose A if unconstrained. Here the budget line is not tangent to indifference curve; the slopes are not equal. The individual would be better off buying more tickets, but she cannot. She would be willing to buy an additional ticket at full price (move to point C). Actually, she would be willing to pay more than full price for a second ticket. (See previous final exams and textbook questions asking, e.g., ‘how much would she be willing to pay?’ She could give up up to an additional C-D of goods for ticket 2 and still be as well off. Adv: Tough questions (final exam-worthy): Why would NFL institute this rule? Who benefits? (Maybe poor consumers?) Why do people see scalping as unfair? Is there ever a justification to forbid a transaction between 2 consenting parties? 4.17 App 2.5: What’s a rich uncle’s promise worth? (Read this at home.) Note: Willie would choose point A with his original income, but his uncle paid him $5k to abstain from sinful goods. If he accepts this and only consumes ‘other goods’, this would get him to point B, gaining him \\(U_3\\). But now suppose that his uncle reneged on the promise, so he is at point C. Graphically (i.e., what point on the graph depicts this, considering ‘other goods’ are considered to cost $1 per other good), how much $ would have been enough to compensate for abstaining?33 4.18 Using the model of choice Why do people spend their money on different things? What do different preferences/indifference curves imply for choices? Note: At this point in the lecture we may move to the powerpoint display, which gives a careful animation of this and several previously mentioned concepts. See the powerpoint here. View in presenter mode. What indicates each persons’ preference for one good over the other? The shape of the indifference curve. The flatter (steeper) the indifference curve the stronger the preference for the good on the Y-axis (X-axis) 4.19 Algebraic/numerical examples Perfect substitutes, but not identical Warning: Thinking caps on. This may be confusing. Consider: are the following ‘perfect substitutes’ for someone who wants caffeine, but has no taste buds? Yes, they are! Recall the definition of perfect substitutes. By ‘perfect substitutes’ we mean pairs of goods for which some amount of one is always valued the same as some amount of the other, and this proportion is always the same. An easy example: I might always be indifferent between three pints of mild ale and two pints of strong ale, if they have the same total alcohol content and I only want to get tipsy. So (for perfect substitutes) buy the one that increases it more per-£. Warning: On the other hand, if goods are not perfect substitutes, margunal utility ratios (thus, marginal rates of substitution) generally depend on consumption levels. Numerical example: \\[U(X,Y)=4X+3Y\\] Rate at which each good (X and Y) increases utility per-unit (derivative) is constant \\(MU_X = 4\\), so every additional unit of X will add four units of utility in this example, no matter what the starting point is. \\(MU_Y = 3\\), … so every unit of Y will add 3 units… So (for perfect substitutes) the consumer will buy the one that increases utility more per-£ Compare \\(MU_X/P_X\\) to \\(MU_Y/P_Y\\) Here, if \\(4/P_X &gt; 3/P_Y\\), then buy X. if \\(4/P_X &lt; 3/P_Y\\), then buy Y (if equal, buy either) Rearranging, if \\(P_X &lt; 4/3 P_Y\\), buy X … etc. (I sometimes call this the “bang for the buck” condition.) Perfect complements AKA ‘Leontief preferences’ Numerical example: \\[U(X,Y)=min(2X,Y)\\] E.g., where X is bicycle frames and Y bicycle wheels. Warning: this min function seems backwards, but it’s correct. I’ve answered this question many times in office hours and on the forum (have a look). No one believes me at first but in the end they realize that this is the case. However, I will not ask you specifically to get this ‘min’ functional form for perfect complements on an exam. Shortcut: figure out the proportions it will be consumed in determine the cost of ‘one bundle of the combination’ at given prices … then buy as many such bundles as you can afford You should be able to do this without having taken economics. Suppose you were given £100 and asked to spend it to make as many sausages-with-baps as possible. No one can eat a sausage without a bap, nor vice-versa. Sausages come in packs of 4, and baps come in packs of 8. How many packs of each will you buy, supposing both types of packs cost £1 each? Middle-ground A Cobb-Douglas example Recall, as I noted above, that for the “general” rather than extreme cases the marginal rate of substitution at a particular point may vary everywhere, and depends on the amount of each good consumed. Below the “Cobb-Douglas” functional form is one example of such a ‘middle ground’ utility function, expressing neither perfect substitutes and are perfect complements. A simple case of this Cobb-Douglas utility is:34 \\[ U(X,Y)=\\sqrt(XY) \\] We are ‘allowed’ to square the whole thing to simplify the problem. Why? Utility is only “identified up to a monotonic transformation”. In general you can transform the utility function in any way that preserves the ordering of preferences over the combinations of X and Y. (E.g., multiply/divide it by any positive amount, add any constant, take it to any power, put it into an exponential or large transformationx… Doing this, replacing utility function with this “new” utility function will have no impact on the choices the person makes. The only thing that will change is the realized level utility, which is not a meaningful concept. However, this will no longer hold later in the module when we consider uncertainty and expected utility. Amount of Y you’d give up to get a unit of X: \\[MRS(X,Y)= MU_X/MU_Y = Y/X\\] Note: The last equality comes from this particular function; it is not always Y/X. Note also that this is the same as ’the amount of Y you’d need to give up a unit of X Checking your work: is this solution reasonable? The more Y I have, the more I am willing to give up to get a unit of X. This seems reasonable, as it reflects satiation. Adv, maths: This slope is derived through calculus. 35 In general, the marginal rate of substitution (at a point) is the ratio of the marginal utilities at that point.36 Here37 (for this Cobb-Douglas), utility-maximization requires, at optimal choices of X and Y: \\[MRS(X,Y)= Y/X = P_X/P_Y\\] Check that it makes sense: As \\(P_X\\) increases, the right-hand-side (RHS) increases, and so to increase the left-hand-side (LHS) I must increase the units of Y consumed, and thus decrease the units of X consumed. Thus as \\(P_X\\) increases I consume more units of X and less Y, which is what you might expect for a standard case. For any price ratio, you can find the ratio of units of Y &amp; X consumed. Then, if you know the prices and total income \\(I\\), you can calculate the consumption and spending on X and Y Rearranging the optimization condition: \\[Y P_Y = X P_X\\] Question (adv.: What is weird about this condition, for this example?38 Combining this with the budget constraint \\[P_X X + P_Y Y = I\\] we can now solve for amounts of X and Y purchased, as functions of prices and income. Calculations: Rearranging the optimization condition, \\(Y = X P_X/P_Y\\). From the budget constraint, \\(X = (I - P_Y Y)/P_X\\). Substituting in for Y yields \\(X = (I - P_Y(X P_X / P_Y))/P_X = I/P_X - X\\) \\(\\rightarrow 2X = I/P_X \\rightarrow X = I/(2P_X)\\) \\(X P_X = I / 2 \\rightarrow\\) this person always spends half her income on X.39 Advanced shortcut tip:40 4.20 Tutorial problems from chapter 2 To be added at bottom… Transitivity (internal consistency): If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.

As you know, multiplying both sides of a (nonzero) equation by negative one leaves the solution unchanged. More simply, where both slopes are negative, ‘the slopes are equal’ is the same as saying ’the absolute value of the slopes are equal.↩ Advanced: The same condition applies to each good you are consuming a positive amount of. ↩ Adv: Hard question, foreshadowing future concepts like the inefficiency of in-kind subsidies… How much would Willie need to be paid to get him to U_3 without the restriction? Is this more or less than $5k?↩ The General Cobb-Douglas function is : \\(U(X,Y)=X^a Y^b\\) where a and b arepositive constants.↩ \\(MU_X\\) is the slope of \\(U(X,Y)\\) in X at a particular point, i.e., the (partial) derivative with respect to X \\(MU_X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} (XY)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2} (XY)^{-1/2}Y = \\frac{1}{2} (Y/X)^{1/2}\\) Similarly, \\(MU_Y = \\frac{1}{2}(X/Y)^{1/2}\\).↩ This is helpful and intuitive, but I am not requiring you to remember this, although it may help you do your calculations.↩ I say ‘here’ both because the MRS comes specifically from this Cobb-Douglas utility function. Also, because we now have nice convex indifference curves with ‘normal’ slopes, unlike for perfect complements or substitutes. The more of one good you have the less you value it relative to the other good (unlike perfect substitutes) but you still value more of it somewhat (unlike for perfect complements)↩ You always spend the same amount on each good, no matter the price (Note, that doesn’t mean the same number of units). This ‘constant expenditure shares’ are a characteristic of Cobb-Douglas functions that limit their usefulness and realism. But we still use them all the time in teaching.↩ To repeat, this is not a general result, it is a result coming from this particular version of the Cobb-Douglas utility function. Obviously, Economics does not predict that everyone spent equal shares of their income on each good!↩ You can solve for the optimal \\(Y\\) by ‘symmetry’: as utility and budget constraint are symmetric everything we said holds replacing X with Y. Thus \\(Y = I/(2P_Y)\\) etc.↩ "],

Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study) First part How do you derive an individual’s demand curve from her utility function?41 What causes shifts in either? What properties do demand curves have? Understand the following concepts and outcomes (and/or how to derive them): Substitution and income effects (of a price change) Goods that are ‘substitutes’ or ‘complements’42 Consumer surplus (from a transaction) The lump-sum principle (and the distortion of taxation) What is a market demand curve, and how do we derive it? Understand the concepts: Price elasticity (of market demand for a product), and what it means to firms’ pricing strategy Income elasticity (…) Cross-price elasticity (between two products) Be able to discuss real world examples and applications of the above Second part Understand real-world issues: A ‘Fixed-basket’ consumer price index (CPI) may overstate inflation The lump-sum principle, the distortion of taxation Fundamental concepts, useful for business &amp; policy: Goods may be ‘substitutes’ or ‘complements’ for one another (not the same as ‘perfect’ substitutes/complements!) How can we consider/compute the Consumer surplus from a transaction? Third problem set… coming soon: Preferences, Utility, Consumer optimization, individual and market demand 5.2 Demand functions Previously, we considered how consumption choices determined by utility functions/indifference curves and budget constraints. We can now consider how an individual’s choice of a good varies with each element of her budget constraint: for income and the price of each good. We will refer to her ‘quantity demanded of good X’ function (or more simply, her ‘demand function’) as follows: \\[Quantity \\: of \\: X \\: demanded = d_x(P_X, P_Y, I; preferences)\\] 5.3 Homogeneity Homogenous (of degree zero) (demand) function A function whose outcome value does not change when all arguments are changed proportionally is homogenous of degree zero \\(d_X(P_X,P_Y,I)\\) is homogenous of degree zero in its arguments. Let \\(f\\) be a function of \\(n\\) variables defined on a set \\(S\\) for which … [the following will always be within its domain]. Then \\(f\\) is homogeneous of degree \\(k\\) if \\(f(tx_1, ..., tx_n) = t^k f(x_1, ..., x_n)\\) for all \\((x_1, ..., x_n) \\in S\\) and all \\(t &gt; 0\\) .43 Multiply all prices and income by the same amount, and the budget constraint is unchanged. Thus ( as preferences have not changed) consumption choices should not change either. E.g., the budget constraint \\(P_X X + P_Y Y = I\\) is the same as the budget constraint \\(2P_X X + 2P_Y Y = 2I\\) Intuition for this: Graphically, the budget line and indifference curves are unchanged, so her optimization problem is identical to the optimization problem before. The point of tangency between an indifference curve and her budget line is the same as before. Consider, if your income, as well as prices, were stated in pennies rather than pounds (e.g., 5 million pennies rather than £50,000), would your choices change?44 This relates to the puzzle of ‘why should monetary policy and inflation have any real effect?’ 5.4 Response to income changes Q: What happens to the quantity purchased of some good as an individual’s income increases? A: Depends on whether the good is normal or inferior. Whether it is normal or inferior (over a particular range) depends on preferences and on the change in the slope of the indifference curves with higher income/utility, as we see below. Defining a normal and inferior good Normal good A good that is bought in greater quantities as income increases. Inferior good A good that is bought in smaller quantities as income increases. In lecture we will move to PPT slides to illustrate this, beginning with ‘Changes in Income: A Normal Good’. You may find these helpful (download and use ‘presentation mode’.) See here Consider: Here we see more income \\(\\rightarrow\\) less expenditure on Z! (Not just ‘a lesser share’ but actually less.) This is because the shape of the indifference curves changes at higher incomes in this example. When people have a lot to spend, they want to spend it on Y and not on Z. (Again in this example, not in general.) Consider, if you won the lottery how much pot noodle would you buy? Pot noodle may be like good Z in this example. Thinking in 3d: ‘as you walk up this hill, its ridge gradually moves to the west’. To be precise, this is not about wealthy people being different than poor people nor that their taste ‘changes’ when they become wealthy. We are considering the same person with higher income, and thus the potential to choose a different bundle of goods. Empirically, these are hard to distinguish, however. Enrichment question: Consider: all goods cannot be inferior. Why not?45 5.5 Substitution and income effects from a fall (or rise) in price `r format_with_col(“What happens to the quantity purchased of some good when the price of the good falls or rises?”, “blue”) This changes both an intercept and a slope. The new utility-maximizing choice is on another indifference curve and it is a point on that curve with a different MRS. Substitution effect (‘Hicksian’) The effect on consumption due to a change in price ‘holding real income or utility constant.’ More precisely, this is defined as the effect on the lowest-cost consumption bundle yielding this utility. This may be a difficult concept to wrap your head around; take some time. This is based on a ‘minimisation problem’ that is ‘dual’ to the utility-maximisation problem from the last chunk. This latter topic is more nuanced and complicated than we will cover in the main content of this module. To fully cover this, we would have to consider the theoretical concept of a ‘compensated’ aka ‘Hicksian’ demand curve, where income is adjusted to hold utility constant while price ratios change. This also allows us to consider ‘net versus gross’ substitution, and ‘equivalent vs compensating variation’. More advanced economics modules will cover this extensively and rigorously. Income effect (of a price change) The remaining effect on consumption; due to the change in purchasing power and achievable utility caused by a change in price. Note that this is largely conceptual: we never actually observe either of these effects alone; we always observe the net effect of both.46 Advanced footnote47 In the lecture we move to the aforementioned PPT slides to illustrate this, beginning with ‘Change in A Good’s Price’. You may find this depiction helpful. I also presented the answer to a problem set question on this on YouTube: Problem set 2: substitution and income effects of price change There are plenty of other YouTube videos covering this online, with better production value than my videos, e.g., Indifference Curves - Income and Substitution Effects for Inferior Goods and Indifference Curves - Income and Substitution Effects for Normal Goods Some things to remember and ‘remember why’: The SUBSTITUTION EFFECT always goes in the opposite direction as the price change The INCOME EFFECT goes in the opposite direction as the price change for a normal good … But the income effect goes in the same direction as the price change for an inferior good Thus the substitution and income effects go in the same direction for a normal good, … and they go in different directions for an inferior good. For an inferior good the net effect is unknown, but usually the substitution effect dominates (but see Giffen goods below) Read on your own (from NS), know: Numerical example of the response to a price change The relative importance of substitution effects for most goods Substitution and income effects for inferior goods 5.6 Different substitution effects of a price change The substitution effect of a price change will depend on the utility function, i.e., on the curvature of the indifference curves at the relevant point. Perfect complements: There is no substitution effect, only an income effect of a price change. There is only a single cost-minimizing bundle of goods that achieves a particular level of utility (including the original level, before the price change, of course). Perfect substitutes: There may be a large substitution effect – a price change may cause a complete switch from one good (or set of goods) to another. On the other hand there may be no substitution effect for a ‘small’ change in price… see examples. In-between utility functions: here the substitution effect of a price change depends on curvature of indifference curve at the relevant point. Above: We see (Left) when goods are perfect complements,48 there is no Substitution effect of a price change. For prices \\(l\\) and \\(l&#39;\\), the minimum-cost consumption that attains \\(U_1\\) is the same point (A,B) (Right) When goods are perfect substitutes, if the price changes, to attain \\(U_1\\) at the lowest cost we must either See a complete shift to the other good, as above, if the ‘better-bang-for-the-buck’ product switches or see no change in the consumption, if the same product remains the better ‘bang for the buck’ Note that, for the above cases, if we consider the combined substitution and income effects of a price decrease in one good we will also see Perfect complements: some increase in the number of combinations of each good consumed, and thus greater utility Perfect substitutes: some increase in the amount of the original good consumed (or, if there is a switch, a larger amount of the other good than was initially affordable), and thus greater utility. 5.7 The (legendary?) Giffen good If the price of a good increases, can quantity demanded actually INCREASE?! Yes, if the good is very inferior, not very substitutable, and is a large portion of income. We call this case a Giffen good. It has never been seen and documented in the wild See Powerpoint Practice question: try to draw indifference curves and budget constraints illustrating this effect for a Giffen good Quick recap Util-max s.t. constraints \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\[Quantity \\: of \\: X \\: demanded = d_x(P_x, P_y, I; preferences)\\] Previous bit: What the constrained utility-maximization implied for demand… “Homogeneity of degree zero” of \\(d_x(P_x, P_y, I)\\) How \\(d_x\\) responds to \\(I\\) (Rem: Inferior and normal goods) How \\(d_x\\) responds to \\(P_x\\) (Rem: Normal or Giffen) Substitution and income effects 5.8 NS App 3.2: The CPI and its biases The government (and many others) want to know ‘how much less (or more) is a pound this year than a pound in the past?’ One of the most prominent measures of this is the “consumer price index (CPI).” This a very important number: It is used for monetary policy (‘inflation targeting’) and for targeting many salaries and benefits. For example, my union is always raising the complaint that salaries have not risen in line with inflation. (But don’t worry, student fees have done.) Getting this number substantially and consistently wrong can lead to huge problems; people may be let into poverty or the government may be led into default. However, it is hard to get this measure right. Using the classical economics framework, we can consider what this means. The UK uses a similar CPI measure to the USA.49 The Bank of England targets a 2% increase in the CPI per year.50 But does the CPI overstate the rate of inflation? It is based on a ‘typical market basket’ (UK: of 700 different goods and services, excluding housing, updated yearly). 1982 vs 2019 two-good example We can consider this with a minimal example, using only our two favourite goods, the scrumptious and nutritious delicacies x and y. Suppose in 1982 the “average household” consumed \\(x_{82}\\) units of good x and \\(y_{82}\\) units of good y. The prices were \\(p^x_{82}\\) and \\(p^y_{82}\\) for each of these, respectively. Now in 2019 the average household consume \\(x_{19}\\) units of good x and \\(y_{19}\\) units of good y. The prices are \\(p^x_{19}\\) and \\(p^y_{18}\\) for each of these, respectively. The expenditure (in pounds) in 1982 was thus \\(b_{82}\\): \\[b_{82}=p^x_{82}x_{82}+p^y_{82}y_{82}\\] How much would it cost to consume the “average 1982” basket today (2019), with today’s prices? … This is defined as \\(b_{19}\\): \\[b_{19}=p^x_{19}x_{82}+p^y_{19}y_{82}\\] The “regular” CPI will simply take the ratio of these two numbers: \\[cpi_{19}=\\frac{b_{19}}{b_{82}}\\] An unadjusted (Fixed-basket) CPI ‘claims’ you need \\(I&#39;\\) to be as well off in 2019. I.e., to buy the exact same basket, including vinyl records. However, as seen in the figure below, by substituting you could be as well off with the lower level of income \\(I&#39;&#39;\\). (And income \\(I&#39;\\) would actually make you better off). In fact, in setting policy, the basket is adjusted yearly, based on a survey of consumers’ spending. But even this is not necessarily the right adjustment, as consumers may be attaining higher or lower utility from these changes. The right adjustment depends on the consumers’ utility functions, which are unobservable. I asked a multi-part question on this on the 2016 Final exam; have a look, these are all on the ELE under ‘Relevant previous year’s assessments, with suggested answer guidelines’ 5.9 The Lump-Sum Principle Have you seen this? 1696: An Act for granting to His Majesty several Rates or Duties upon Houses for making good the Deficiency of the clipped Money… Properties with between ten and twenty windows paid an extra four shillings (£24.79 in 2016), and those above twenty windows paid an extra eight shillings (£49.57 in 2016).} Wikipedia: window tax Consider the ‘least efficient tax’: Suppose the UK government imposes a tax on all windows above 4 per house. Suppose all UK residents put bricks over their excess windows. The government raises no revenue but people are certainly worse off. And What’s going on here? 51 The social cost (deadweight loss, i.e., ‘DWL’) of taxation is greater the more taxes change ‘compensated’ behaviour (via the substitution effect).52 The most efficient tax: raises the most revenue for a given utility loss reduces utility the least for a given revenue … is a ‘lump-sum tax’: same tax no matter what you do (including work/leisure!) This is a rationale for the poll tax, the proposed tax that brought down Margaret Thatcher’s government A common measure of the burden: ‘amount a person would be willing to pay to avoid tax’, for a given revenue raised *A step-by-step illustration of this is given in the PowerPoint file under ‘Lump sum principle’. The key to fully understanding the illustration of the dwl of the commodity-tax: how do we see that the blue and red dot both raise the same revenue? Although you could compute these tax revenues algebraically and see they are the same (see footnote in NS textbook), but it is better to gain intuitive insight. The revenue can be seen as the distance on the vertical axis, representing the value in terms of Y at the pre-tax price ratio. This holds whether we measure it in terms of either commodity – you just have to pick one. The tax revenue is the difference between the individual’s income and the amount he consumes; both measured in terms of one commodity only, according to the actual opportunity cost of that commodity, not measured with the ‘after tax price’. Note…53 Read on your own, know: The potential inefficiency of in-kind programmes and subsidies (App 3.3)54 Potential ‘expansive’ exam question: ‘Consider the benefits of in-kind programmes rather than cash transfers. Specifically, explain why…’ 5.10 Changes in the Price of Another Good;‘complements’ or ‘substitutes’ In the previous 2-good diagrams the impact of the change in \\(P_X\\) on \\(Y\\) was mechanical. With a new budget constraint and a new \\(X\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\), the individual needed to spend the remainder on \\(Y\\). If expenditure on one good went up, expenditure on the other good must have gone down, and vice/versa. With 3 or more goods, this need not hold. ``` Complements If a rise in \\(P_X\\) leads the quantity demanded of Y, \\(d_Y\\), to decrease (and vice-versa), then goods Y and X are (gross) complements to one another. How to remember: ‘complements’ go together, so the quantity-demanded response to a price change is the same for both goods – the opposite direction as the price change (unless Giffen). Substitutes If a rise in \\(P_X\\) leads \\(d_Y\\) to increase (and vice versa), then goods Y and X are (gross) substitutes to one another. A tip on how to remember ‘complements’ vs ‘substitutes’: ‘Substitutes’ are competing to meet the same desires, so when you buy more of one, you tend to buy less of the other. Thus the quantity demanded response to a price change go in opposite directions for the two goods Thus, as quantity-demanded for good A typically goes in the opposite direction as the price of A … quantity demanded for a substitute good B will go in the same direction as the price of A.55 5.11 Individual demand curves Quantity of X demanded \\[d_X(P_X,P_Y,I; \\: preferences)\\] ‘Individual demand curve’: depicts how the amount of a good an individual buys responds to that good’s price How do we derive this (graphically)? We can ‘map it out’ by increasing \\(P_X\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) budget constraint shifts in \\(\\rightarrow\\). In each case we find new point of tangency with indifference curve. We plot this in the example below (better illustrated in the PowerPoint, perhaps.) 5.12 Shifts in an individual’s demand curve Q: What might cause the (individual’s) demand curve for a product to shift (inward or outward)? Not: Not ‘a change in the price of that good’. Not a shift in the supply curve. Yes: Change in price of complements or substitutes for that good Change in income Perhaps: Change in consumer’s information, preferences,56 or other factors (weather, etc). I’m sure you can see how I could write a multiple-choice question about this. Be sure you understand shifts vs movements along, and ‘demand’ vs ‘quantity demanded’. Know the difference between shifts in a shift in a demand (or supply) curve and movements along a demand curve, and the terminology. This will almost surely be on one of the exams in some form, see e.g., NS micro quiz 3.4. Hint: I suggest you avoid referring to ‘supply and demand’; refer to either ‘supply and demand curves’ or ‘quantity demanded or supplied’. 5.13 Consumer surplus Consumer surplus The extra value individuals receive from consuming a good over what they pay for it. What people would be willing to pay for the right to consume a good at its current price rather than not being able to buy it at all.57 The area between the demand curve and the market price A measure of consumer welfare, useful for policy analysis Advanced math-y:: With a linear demand curve this is a triangle, which has an area that is easy to compute. More generally, this is a `definite integral’. This can be applied to the individual or market demand curve to obtain individual or total consumer surplus (although there are some technical issues with the latter). Also, ‘introducing a new good…’58 Note: We may skip section ‘consumer surplus and utility’ in lecture, but please read over it for understanding 5.14 Market demand (function) Market demand (or better, ‘market quantity demanded’) The total quantity of a good or service demanded by all potential buyers This just sums the individual quantities demanded (at a given price) Market demand curve Relationship between total quantity demanded of a good and its price, ceteris paribus Sum the individual demand curves (‘horizontally’ … quantities demanded at each price) Numerical examples of this may be covered in tutorial, and on an exam/assessment Some of our previous results about individual demand also hold for market demand, while others do not, or only if we make restrictive assumptions 5.15 Shifts in the Market Demand Curve Shifts in the market demand curve are caused by similar things that cause individual demand curve shifts Increases in overall income (for normal goods) Reduced prices of complements, increased price of substitute Change in tastes However, the aggregate income does not have a single effect; it cannot be easily reduced to a single variable here. You can only express the demand curve as a function of aggregate income under restrictive assumptions. In general, it depends who gets this income. (See ‘aggregation issues’). (In addition, the market demand curve could shift out if more consumers enter the market, e.g., because of demographic change.) A random example: 2008: ‘Gas prices forcing demand for SUVs to plummet’ LINK 2015: ‘Economy, gas prices drive demand for SUVs, high-end cars’ LINK 5.16 Elasticities This is a fundamental mathematics concept that comes from Physics; it’s not just for Economics. How do we measure and compare the extent to which one thing responds to another? E.g., which is ‘larger’?: the change in quantity demanded of oranges when the price of oranges rises or the change in quantity demanded of apple juice when the price of apple juice rises? (Or the response to changes in the price of a related good, or to income.) Difficulty: These things are measured in different units and the prices have different starting values. Elasticity: the measure of the % change in one variable brought about by a 1% change in another variable. a unitless measure; will be the same no matter how these variables are measured. Think of responsiveness when talking about elasticity. Actually it’s a measure from physics having to do with rubber bands, they tell me. Advanced footnote59 If a 5% fall in the price of oranges typically results in a 10% increase in quantity bought… we say that each percent fall in the price of oranges leads to an increase in sales of about 2 percent. I.e., the ‘‘elasticity’’ of orange sales with respect to price is about 2, Note that elasticities may not be constant; they may depend on the starting point; e.g., linear demand implies a different price elasticity at each point. 5.17 Price elasticity of demand Price elasticity of demand: \\[e_{Q_{d}, p} = \\frac{percent \\ change \\ in \\ Q_d}{percent \\ change \\ in \\ p} \\] \\[ = \\frac{\\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}/\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}\\] This should always be negative (except for Giffen goods). It is a unitless measure related to the slope of the demand curve. It is very important for price-setting firms (more on this later). Examples from the headlines India’s Hike Messenger takes aim at WhatsApp “Reliance ended up showing that there is elasticity in the market. If you drop prices, people will come on board,” he said. ‘Next’ to add more space despite retail sales ‘moving backwards’ The retailer does not expect any impact from the drop in sterling since the Brexit vote to kick in until at least the Spring of 2017, as it had hedged some of its foreign-currency exposures in advance. Still, it expects expenses to rise by up to 5 per cent next year. ‘The last time we had to increase prices (which was in 2010 when cotton prices soared) we estimated that price elasticity was around 1.1. If that remains the case today, a retail selling price increase of 5% would result in a fall in unit sales of -5.5% and a fall in like for like sales value of between -0.5% to -1.0%. In the scheme of things, we think that this drag on sales is manageable and less damaging than taking a significant hit to margin.’ 5.18 Properties of price elasticity of demand Goods with many close substitutes at a similar price will be highly elastic with few substitutes … inelastic Typically: more elastic in the long run than the short run. Q : why?60 We refer to price elasticities with the following terminology: \\(e_{Q,p}\\) \\(abs(e_{Q,p})\\) Term \\(&lt; -1\\) \\(&gt;1\\) Elastic \\(= -1\\) \\(=1\\) Unit Elastic \\(&gt; -1\\) \\(&lt;1\\) Inelastic Note that sometimes elasticities are expressed in absolute value terms (a positive number). It should be clear from the context. Consider an individual’s expenditure on a product. The total expenditure (the firm’s revenue from this): price \\(\\times\\) quantity By taking the total differential of this (you don’t need to), and recalling the ‘multiplication rule’ of derivatives… We have that for small changes in price, the percent change in total expenditure is: percent change in price + percent change in quantity Try it out (for small changes) and you see this will hold approximately. As \\(e_{Q,P}\\) tells you the percent change in quantity for each (small) percentage change in price, we can use this to determine the change in expenditure for a small change in price. Considering very small increases in a good’s price: If the (individual’s) demand is price-elastic, quantity will decrease by a larger percentage than price increased. Thus her expenditure (on this good) will decline. If the (individual’s) demand is price-inelastic, quantity will decrease by a smaller percentage than price increased. Thus her expenditure (on this good) will increase . If the (individual’s) demand is unit-elastic (with respect to price), quantity will decrease by a the same percentage as price increased. Thus her expenditure (on this good) will be unchanged. Example and (slightly more advanced) algebra… If price rises by 20% and quantity demanded falls by 20% what happens to revenue? Suppose p=10 and q=10 so TR=100. Then when p=12 and q=8 TR=96. Huh? Price increased by 20% and quantity decreased by 20% so shouldn’t TR be unchanged? No! This only works for small changes. TR is unchanged when p \\(\\times\\) q stays the same. With a change in each \\(\\delta p\\) and \\(\\delta q\\), the new revenue is \\((p+\\delta p)(q+\\delta q) = pq+\\delta p q + \\delta q p + \\delta p \\delta q\\). This is the same as before if \\(pq=pq+\\delta p q + \\delta q p + \\delta p \\delta q\\), i.e., if \\(\\delta p q + \\delta q p + \\delta p \\delta q=0\\), i.e., if \\(\\delta p q + \\delta p \\delta q =-\\delta q p\\), i.e., if \\(\\delta p q/p + \\delta p \\delta q/p =-\\delta q\\), i.e., if \\(\\delta p/ \\delta q (q/p) + \\delta p /p =-1\\), i.e., if \\(-e_p + \\delta p /p = -1\\) In the limit, as \\(\\delta p\\) goes to zero, this gives us that ‘unit elasticity means a small change in quantity leads to no change in revenue.’ Important question/result Q: Suppose a firm is setting its price and selling to only one individual , and facing no competitors. It should basically never want to set its price at a point where demand is inelastic. Why not?61 Price elasticity of demand: also read/consider Numerical example (may be covered in tutorial) Skip: Unit Elastic Curve Read on your own: Application 3.7: An Experiment in Health Insurance 5.19 Income elasticity of demand; Normal, luxury, and inferior goods Income elasticity of demand % change in quantity demanded of a good in response to 1% change in income (approximately). \\[e_{Q_d,I} = \\frac{percent \\ change \\ in \\ Q_d}{percent \\ change \\ in \\ I} \\] \\[ = \\frac{\\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}/\\frac{\\Delta I}{I}\\] Normal goods: \\(e_{Q,I} &gt; 0\\) Inferior goods: \\(e_{Q,I} &lt; 0\\) Luxury goods: \\(e_{Q,I} &gt; 1\\) E.g., cocaine is a luxury good, if, when I win £1000 in the lottery, I will increase my consumption of cocaine by more than £1000 … (assuming, as in classical models, that I treat all sources of income the same Q: Is a luxury good a normal good?62 Some real-world discussion of this Prof. Muellbauer letter to FT Sir, Professor Gordon Gemmill (Letters, December 14), surprisingly for a trained economist, assumes an income elasticity of demand of zero for housing: that is, that people do not demand more and better housing as they become richer. Nowhere in the world is this the case! My own empirical work demonstrates that around two-thirds of the rise in UK house prices, corrected for general inflation, since 1980 is because supply is not keeping up with income and population growth. Other drivers do exist … The price effects of extra supply take time to build up. I agree on that. But just imagine what would happen if we did nothing more than we are now doing: population and income growth would drive prices even higher even though we already hold the record for rises in house prices since 1970 among the group of seven leading high-income countries. We need to build far more housing, in the right locations. And we need to start now. - Prof John Muellbauer Nuffield College, Oxford, UK 5.20 Further material to study Please read the rest of NS chapter 3, including Some elasticity estimates (note these are a bit dated) Problem set on this material will be included soon.

At least they ‘should’ not change; your optimal choices would not change. Perhaps in some specific context the way the problem is framed may affect people’s choices, but that is not what is being asked here. Furthermore, we are considering ‘normative’ economics in the sense of ‘what would rational optimizing agents do’?↩ There are ‘adding up’ conditions. You always spend all of your income. Thus, if as your income increases, you spend less on some subset of goods, you must spend more on the remaining goods.↩ Although econometricians attempt to estimate each separately, through independent variation in income and prices.↩ Advanced point: the standard definition of the ‘income effect’ of a price change actually combines two effects that we saw when looking at the impact of an income change on consumption of X. More consumption of each good is possible, but the MRS may differ at this higher consumption and utility level.↩ Note, there was previously a typo, this had read ‘substitutes’ and the one below ‘complements’↩ a change from the ‘RPI’ in 2003, although RPI is still used for some things↩ Something to know: what has been the inflation rate in recent years? This is an example of ‘market and industry knowledge’ that employers value. True, you can look this stuff up, but having a general sense of these things rolling around in your brain will ground your thinking. As an analogy, suppose you were a mariner navigating the seven seas and you had to go online every time to remember which direction was North or South.↩ Note: ‘Taxes based on ground-floor area’ are mentioned throughout the web, but I couldn’t find an authoritative reference to this. If anyone finds one, please let me know!↩ Why ‘compensated’ behavior? Essentially, because taxes in general will always leave people with less effective income, causing them to change their consumption choices to reflect the new, lower indifference curves. What matters for the deadweight loss is how the taxes change their behavior at this new lower-income state. This is a fundamental issue in Public Finance/taxation.↩ This illustration is a single example; to see that this holds generally, take Public Economics. There are some interesting and surprising results. A caveat: If you can’t tax one good (e.g., leisure) you don’t want to tax all other goods equally. In general, you want to tax goods that distort behaviour less overall.↩ In the UK, the ‘welfare wall’ is usually referred to as the ‘benefits trap’ or ‘unemployment trap’.

["production-costs.html", "6 Production and costs (brief coverage)(L4-L5) 6.1 Production and costs (brief treatment: coverage) 6.2 The Firm’s Production function 6.3 Marginal product 6.4 Cost minimizing input choice 6.5 Types of costs (‘Basic cost concepts’) 6.6 Returns to scale", " 6 Production and costs (brief coverage)(L4-L5) 6.1 Production and costs (brief treatment: coverage) Some key goals of these chunk Better understand how economists depict a firm’s production function … and how a firm can ‘trade off one input for another’ in the producing a particular output … and why the production function may have increasing returns to scale or diminishing returns to scale Our coverage of the production function, inputs, and the firm’s cost structure is somewhat brief. Key issues are highlighted here. I’m giving you the ‘basic idea’ so we can continue the story. Recommendation: Read the following parts of NS Text ch 6-7; you can skip the parts not mentioned and skip the applications NS Ch 6: Production function (at least the basic idea) Returns to scale (!) Basic cost concepts (!) ‘Cost minimising input choice’ (understand key principle of ‘bang-for-the-buck’ equalisation) Cost curves (!) … to help understand the key concepts in following chunks In standard neo-classical economics the firm (each firm) is treated as a unified decisionmaker whose goal is to maximise profits … this profit-maximization assumption ‘leads to predictions of firm behaviour which are time and again bourne out by the evidence’63 6.2 The Firm’s Production function A production function is a mathematical relationship between inputs (capital, labour, materials, etc.) and outputs. \\[q = f( K, L, M, ...)\\] \\[q = f(K, L)\\] E.g., a particular Cobb-Douglas in two inputs, \\(q =2L^{1/3}K^{2/3}\\) “Leontief” fixed proportions: \\(Q=\\min(a_{1}X_{1},a_{2}X_{2},\\dotsc ,a_{n}X_{n})\\) “O-ring” production (Michael Kremer, recent Nobel memorial prize winner) Given its production choice, the firm tries to produce it at the minimum cost - This resembles a consumer maximizing utility subject to budget constraints64 One reason why you might care about this: How will you earn money in the future? Production may be a function of capital (esp ‘high-tech’), materials, and various types/skill-levels of labour. We’ll note that in a competitive market each input, including workers, is paid based on their marginal contribution to output, given the firms’ optimising choice of inputs. If production functions (or costs of various inputs) change ‘your kind of labour’ may become less productive (per hour) as part of this process, meaning wages must fall. If they fall low enough people may not want to work. If these are ‘sticky’ or legally prevented from falling firms may reduce employment of ‘your kind of labour.’ 2020 US presidential candidate Andrew Yang is making this sort of argument, and he claims the best response is a tax-funded ‘universal basic income’. Do you think he is correct? 6.3 Marginal product Marginal product Additional output from adding +1 unit of an input, holding other inputs constant. Marginal Product of Labour—\\(MP_L\\): Slope of production function in units of labour (holding capital etc constant) \\[MP_L=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L}f(K,L)\\] Similarly for Marginal Product of Capital (\\(MP_K\\)) It is fairly standard to assume a diminishing marginal product of each input (by definition, holding other inputs constant). Intuitively: As we hold the amount of equipment and factory space constant …Increasing number of worker we can produce more but each additional worker we hire adds less of a positive increment. … The shop floor grows crowded and workers’ access to tools and equipment grows limited. This is the famous Too many cooks problem (warning: that video is a bit graphic). Similarly, as we add more capital in terms of technology and robots … this increases production … But again each additional machine adds less and less to output then does the previous machine or tool. … Certain point additional machines cannot be particularly carefully used if there is no one to supervise them; at least so we thought See further discussion of this in the NS text 6.4 Cost minimizing input choice Typically, a particular quantity (\\(q\\)) could be produced with several different combinations of inputs. E.g., smoothies are produced with labour (employees), technology (blenders, robots perhaps, refrigerators), and raw materials (fruit, ice, yoghurt etc). Which combination will the firm choose? \\[q = f(K,L,...)\\] Main point: Whatever \\(q\\) it wants to produce, the firm uses the minimum cost combination of inputs! It chooses inputs to get the best ‘bang for the buck’; \\(\\rightarrow\\) where the input mix is optimal, each input yields the same marginal product per £ Key definitions and results: These results follow from the same logic we used when considering utility maximisation! Consider any combination of (say, two) inputs (capital and labor, K and L) and the output this yields. At any such point the firm can ‘substitute capital for labour’ (and hold production constant) This rate it can substitute one for another, at a certain point (K,L) is called the ‘(marginal) rate of technical substitution’ or \\(RTS(K,L)\\) This will equal the ratio of the ‘marginal product of labour’ (\\(MP_L\\)) and the ‘marginal product of capital’ (\\(MP_K\\)) When the firm chooses inputs optimally (and where it uses both), it chooses K and L to set the \\(MRT(K,L)\\) equal to the price ratio of these inputs (\\(w/r\\)… wages \\(w\\) per unit of for labor, rent \\(r\\) per unit of capital). ‘Same bang for the buck at optimal choices \\(K^*\\) and \\(L^*\\)’ i.e.:65 \\[\\frac{MP_K(K^*,L^*)}{r}= \\frac{MP_L(K^*,L^*)}{w}\\] Also, if markets for labour and capital are (perfectly) competitive, when we consider the price of each outputs: this ‘bang for the buck’ (measured in terms of revenue) will be the same for all inputs and for all production processes Inputs (workers, owners of capital) in every industry will be paid based on their (marginal) productivity … E.g, if workers were being paid less than their marginal productivity, they would be ‘hired away’ by another producer, ultimately raising wages until these equal the marginal productivity, the marginal contribution to revenue This is very similar to the consumer optimization we discussed. For a given total input cost, the firm wants to produce as much as possible. A better way of thinking about this is that for a given production, the firm wants to incur as low a cost as possible. However, there is no ‘hard budget constraint’ as in the consumer optimisation case. The firm’s output choice will be chosen to maximise it’s profit, with no constraints other than ‘non-negativity’. Summing up: Optimisation (given a production function and input prices)… yields a (minimum) cost for every output \\(q\\) a firm chooses to produce. 6.5 Types of costs (‘Basic cost concepts’) Fixed costs (FC) Costs that must be regularly incurred to remain in business (i.e., for any level of output), but that do not vary with the level of output Variable costs (VC) Costs that increase with the quantity produced. Sunk costs Costs that have been incurred in the past that can never be recovered. Sunk costs should not enter into any economic decisions. FC from previous years are sunk costs; FC for future years are not. In 2019 we are skipping the discussion of the short-run here: we will assume all inputs can be adjusted. Total cost function: \\(c(q)\\) or \\(TC(q)\\). Total costs are fixed costs plus variable costs Fixed costs: must be incurred to produce even the first unit (e.g., hire factory space) Variable costs: increase as one produces more units Marginal cost \\(MC(q)=c&#39;(q)\\): rate that costs increase in quantity; the derivative of the cost function cost of producing one additional unit (given that you already produced q units) ‘Average cost’ \\(AC=c(q)/q\\): the production cost per unit produced Average costs are also the total ‘rise over run’ for the TC curve at a given quantity as the firm optimally chooses its inputs. Average costs (for a firm) may be increasing or decreasing in quantity. This depends on the returns to scale. 6.6 Returns to scale Are bigger firms always more efficient? Do things get cheaper to produce the more we produce? If so, what limits the size of firms? I.e., why don’t we see only one firm in each industry? Returns to scale The rate at which output increases in response to a proportional increase in all inputs. Constant returns to scale (CRS) If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor equal to X. E.g., doubling all inputs (labour, capital, land, etc) means exactly doubling all outputs Increasing returns to scale (IRS) If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor greater than X. Decreasing returns to scale (DRS) If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor less than X. Increasing average costs \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) Decreasing returns to scale Decreasing average costs \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) Increasing returns to scale Constant average costs \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) Constant returns to scale Consider: why/when would we expect DRS/IRS/CRS? (We discuss this further below.) The shape of the marginal cost curve depends on the production function Constant returns to scale: constant MC (and no FC) Decreasing returns to scale: increasing MC Increasing returns to scale: decreasing MC (and/or constant FC) Arguments/reasons for scale (dis)economies IRS Fixed costs (incorporation, buildings, management, planning, R&amp;D) spread over more units Should always be able to at least ‘double everything’ and produce twice as much? (so at least CRS) Scale allows specialisation DRS Limited resources in whole (or local) economy; costs begin to rise Managerial issues and coordination problems, bigger ‘centre’ to lobby for favours (See ‘theories of the firm’) Harder to give incentives to top manager/CEO? Larger firm \\(\\rightarrow\\) harder to make CEO liable for losses Advanced footnote66 `r format_with_col(“Mock exam question: Give one reason why production may exhibit ‘increasing returns to scale’ and one reason why it may have ‘decreasing returns to scale’.”, “gray”) Computing… If you know the production function, how do you know if the ‘returns to scale’ are increasing or decreasing? Slide in a constant \\(\\alpha&gt;1\\) next to each input, simplify, and compare to the original production E.g.: \\[Q(L,K) = L^{1/4}K^{1/2}\\] . . . \\[Q(\\alpha L, \\alpha K) = (\\alpha L)^{1/4}(\\alpha K)^{1/2}\\] \\[=\\alpha^{1/4}\\alpha^{1/2}L^{1/4}K^{1/2}=\\alpha^{3/4}L^{1/4}K^{1/2}=\\alpha^{3/4}Q(L,K)\\] \\(\\rightarrow\\) So if we increase inputs by \\(\\alpha\\) here, we increase output by \\(\\alpha^{3/4}&lt;\\alpha\\), so DRS everywhere for this production function. Note that this case was easy; returns to scale may not be constant: there can be IRS at one point and CRS or DRS at another. You can always just try doubling everything and see if output doubles but this will only tell you the returns to scale in this particular range. Quote from Jehle and Remy’s ‘Advanced Microeconomic Theory’, 2011↩ A major difference: a firm also chooses the level of output, while the consumer has a fixed budget constraint … we return to this in later sections.↩ Of course there can be ‘corner solutions’ as in the consumer case, where you optimally use none of one input↩ I think the first point is valid, but it doesn’t suggest that 2 firms would be more efficient than 1; these DRS would set in as a function of total output, not a single firm’s output. The second and third arguments are complicated and perhaps harder to justify. The case for DRS is unproven, IMHO↩ "],

Context We considered production functions and cost … Now: what output should the firm set to maximise profits? (Next: the consequences of this for the market) 7.2 Important aside: What are ‘firms’ and why do they exist? Standard (classical) economics definition: A firm is an entity that transforms inputs into outputs. We assume a firm’s goal is to maximise profit. Aside… Ronald Coase asked the question “Why do large entities called ‘firms’ exist?” They engage in many activities and own many assets They often use ‘command and control’ within firms rather than markets This spawned a large literature on the ‘theory of the firm’ emphasizing things like incomplete contracts, hold-up, relationship specific assets, lobbying costs, and more. Marginal revenue Marginal revenue The additional gross income a firm gains from increasing the quantity it supplies by one unit Remember, given its choice of production the firm will always choose the highest price at which it can sell all the units it has produced. We will come back to this when we discuss monopolies Q: What will be the impact of increasing quantity on a firm’s revenue?? It can sell an additional unit at some price But it may have to reduce prices on all units to do this (more on this later) MR for firm facing ‘downward-sloping demand’67 Assume it’s charging a single price to all consumers. \\(\\rightarrow\\) It can sell more only by reducing price on all units E.g., it can sell 51 units rather than 50 by reducing price from £1 to £0.99 The marginal revenue is less than market price here because - Get (new) market price for additional unit \\(\\rightarrow\\) + £0.99 - But lose £0.01 on all previous 50 units \\(\\rightarrow\\) - £0.50 - So MR is £0.49 MR curves be like: Q: Why might MR curves typically decrease in Q?68 MR for a ‘price-taking’ firm Under ‘perfect competition’ (which we will describe soon), each firm is a ‘price-taker’ Each firm: gets market price P for each additional unit the firm is small, so its output has (virtually) no impact on P69 (More on this later) Thus its marginal revenue is constant at \\(P\\)! Note that for such a firm, the total revenue curve will be a straight line … ‘double quantity and you double revenue’ 7.3 Profit-maximisation If operating, set optimal output \\(q^*\\) Under standard assumed conditions Advanced footnote70 … profits are maximised at the unique \\(q^*\\) such that \\(MR=MC\\) This holds for all types of firms For firms with market power (‘price-setters’) the MR takes into account the downward sloping demand curve. For a price-taker, setting \\(MR(q)=MC(q)\\) means setting \\(P=MC(q)\\), because \\(P=MR(q)\\) 71 Consider a firm with market power: The firm wants to maximise profit. This means making the vertical distance between the revenue and cost curves as large as possible. If the curves had differing slopes, profits could be increased by adjusting output in the direction in which the curves diverged. (Consider this starting from points \\(q_1\\) or \\(q_2\\) on the curves below.) 7.4 MR=mc condition for a price-taking firm \\[MR(q) = P\\] … because of price-taking Notice in the diagram below that the profits—the distance between total revenue (TC) and total costs (TC) is maximised at the quantity \\(q\\) where \\(MR(q)=mc(q)\\), i.e., where \\(P=mc(q)\\). 7.5 Supply decisions of a price-taking firm Price-taking firms: How much should they charge? They can sell all the output they and at market price P. Will price at P. We can see this is the case by considering points other than this and noting that these are always worse (for the firm): Set p&lt;P* \\(\\rightarrow\\) Sell same amount, earn less. Not smart! Set p&gt;P* \\(\\rightarrow\\) Sell no units. Bad move! Price-taking firms How much should they produce? One standard assumption is that \\(MC(0)&lt;P^*\\), \\(MC(q)\\) increasing in q (assumed) (… perhaps a more reasonable assumption is that there is at least some region for which AVC&lt; \\(P^*\\)). Thus, the firm should choose q for which \\(MC(q) = P^*\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘Perfectly competitive firms price at marginal cost’ But if P* is below your average cost for any possible output q you must shut down! If it’s below ‘(short run) average variable costs’, shut down right away; each unit you produce adds to your loss! If it’s below your (long-run) average cost, shut down before incurring any more fixed costs, you will never be able to produce at a profit! NOTE: I am not focusing on the distinction between the short and long run cost curves in this module 7.6 Some suggested practice problems from Nicholson and Snyder Chapter 8 (12th ed) ‘Problems’: 8.1 Supplemental: 8.5, 8.7 See example in table 1 in text.↩ Ans: Demand curves slope down, so less revenue for each additional unit. Also, the impact of the reduced price is greater because the more we sell the more units this affects.↩ The NS text gives a good illustration and examples of why it is fine to assume that a small producer’s output has no impact on price↩ There are specific conditions for the existence of a ‘unique maximum-profit quantity’. E.g., this will be ensured by everywher- decreasing marginal revenue and increasing or nondecreasing marginal costs↩ Ans: if q&gt;q*, MR, which is decreasing in q, will be below MC. Firm can do better if it reduces q somewhat– cost decrease will be larger than revenue decrease. If \\(q&lt;q^{\\ast}\\), \\(MR&lt;MC\\) – better to increase q and revenue increases more than costs↩ "],

This implies that its marginal cost curve is its supply curve! (except where \\(AVC(q)&gt;P^*\\) for all q; where it produces zero) Note: Where the minimum AVC exceeds P*, the firm has no way to produce profitably, so it will produce nothing. For a further revision, this process is well mapped out in a step-by step Powerpoint you can download here. Start from the beginning, this is specifically referred to beginning on about slide 20 ‘The Firm’s Long-Run Decision to Exit or Enter a Market’; use ‘presentation mode’. However, note that slide 19 states ‘the firm considers its sunk costs when deciding to exit, but ignores them when deciding whether to shut down.’ This is not stated precisely. They are referring to those ‘fixed costs’ which must be incurred at regular intervals (e.g., a license fee every year)… from the pov of midyear, this years’ license fee is sunk, but next year’s is not. To get the market supply curve: Sum each firm’s supply curve horizontally (recalling that a price-taking firm’s supply curve is the relevant part of its MC curve). This is shown below: 8.3 SR Price determination Sum each firm’s supply curve (part of MC curve) to get the market supply curve. Next sum individual demand curves to get the market demand curve. At what point do these intersect? At this price \\(P^*\\) we have \\(Q_D(P^*)=Q_S(P^*)\\) We call this the (short run) equilibrium price This price may be above average variable or even average total costs for many firms (\\(P^*&gt;AC\\)) \\(\\rightarrow\\) They can make real economic profits! (But only in the short run.) To avoid confusion, recall that firms are producing where their marginal costs equal the market price. MC are often assumed to increase as quantity increases; this means that only the cost of the last unit produced equals \\(P^*\\). Previous units had marginal costs below \\(P^*\\). Thus average (variable) costs may be below \\(P^*\\) 8.4 Illustration of SR price determination Price signal The price acts as a signal (leading to efficient choices): to firms, telling them ‘how much to produce’ It tells them: ‘Don’t produce past the point where your marginal cost exceeds the price you can get in the market, jerk!’ At the price where the market ‘clears’ \\(Q_d=Q_s\\). It also acts as a signal to consumers, telling them ‘how much to purchase’ …and ‘which consumers should obtain the units produced’? By the definition of the market-clearing price \\(P^*\\), consumers can buy all they desire at P. I.e., they can buy units until the last unit they buy gives them a marginal utility of \\(P^*\\). This foreshadows a result we will come to later, the efficiency of equilibrium outcomes (under given conditions). The above result means that each consumer values the last unit they consume at the same amount. Thus, we never have that the ‘wrong’ consumer obtains the good. This in term implies there can be no further gains from ‘exchange among consumers’. If prices were too low (e.g., because of a price ceiling), implying \\(Q_d(p)&gt;Q_s(p)\\), then demand would have to be rationed, and consumers who valued the product more than other consumers might not get as much. 8.5 Shifts in S and D curves (See NS text; this is revision, to some extent.) 8.6 The Long run Here we assume ‘free entry and exit’ of firms, and a large number of firms have access to the same production process. Suppose there are positive economic profits in an industry (for efficient producers)74 I.e., suppose \\(P^*&gt;AC(q)\\) for some q. This implies the following process. \\(\\rightarrow\\) Firms enter \\(\\rightarrow\\) Supply curve shifts out \\(\\rightarrow\\) equilibrium price declines \\(\\rightarrow\\) profits decline the above process continues until economic profit falls to zero i.e., until \\(P^*=AC(q)\\) for the minimum AC q Note that positive economic profits are sometimes called ‘supernormal profits.’ Remember, economic profits are profits after subtracting the (opportunity) cost of capital, management, and other inputs. Did you enjoy watching these dominoes fall? We can do it in the opposite direction too. Now instead suppose there are negative economic profits in an industry (for efficient producers) I.e., suppose\\(P^*&lt;AC(q)\\) for any q. This implies the following series of events: \\(\\rightarrow\\) Firms exit \\(\\rightarrow\\) Supply curve shifts inwards \\(\\rightarrow\\) equilibrium price rises \\(\\rightarrow\\) profits rise the above process continues until economic profits rise to zero i.e., until \\(P^*=AC(q)\\) for the minimum AC q Long Run Equilibrium In long run equilibrium: Firms choose output to maximize their profits Profit max: \\(P^* = MC(q)\\) No firms in the market want to exit, and no firms out of the market want to enter Zero economic profits: \\(P^* = AC(q)\\) Also: With free entry and exit (and no limits on production)… All firms in the market must produce the quantity that minimizes their average cost, and all must have the same average cost. I.e., \\(P* = min AC(q) = MC(q)\\) for any firm in the market I.e., the MC curve intersects the AC curve at its minimum point. And this is the same average cost for all firms All firms (in the market) produce the quantity \\(q\\) that minimizes their AC, and for all firms this is the same average cost. Why is this the case? Why is \\(P* = min [AC(q)] = MC(q)\\)? Which implies… no profit in equilibrium and firms produce at P=MC. and thus implies that \\(P*=AC(q)=MC(q)\\) for all firms in the market. Answer ‘by contradiction’: Suppose here that a firm were producing at a point above it’s minimum AC, i.e., suppose \\(AC(q)&gt; min [AC(q)]\\). This firm could instead produce at the q that minimised its AC, and make a profit (contradicting the above) … (and so would other firms, who’d be induced to enter) We assume a large number of firms have access to this efficient technology. As previously mentioned, entry shifts the supply curve out, equilibrium price falls, until the point where \\(P^*=AC(q)\\) for firms producing at this lowest AC point. 8.7 Long Run (LR) Supply (*) (* Note: In 2019 this is not covered in detail and it will not appear explicitly on the mid-term assessment, but it might be part of a ‘choose-able’ question on the final assesment.) We have the SR supply curve (upward sloping). But we know that in the long run this will shift out in response to a price change. Taking this shift into account gives us the Long Run Supply Curve. To avoid confusion, note: In the SR there are movements along this curve in response to price changes. In the longer run, it does shift in response to price changes, as firms enter. The LR supply curve, which we will now define, does not shift in response to price changes But other things may cause it to shift, like changes in input costs So what will the LR supply curve look like? If demand shifts out, do more enter and produce at the same efficient minimum AC? Depends on whether entry and higher aggregate production change the firms’ cost functions Input costs may rise; increased demand for scarce inputs, skilled workers and public resources (Also, other potential ‘externalities’ between firms, consumers, e.g., network externalities) DR opinion…75 As alluded to in the introduction, this is relevant when we want to consider the impact of long run population and economic growth Economic and population growth leads to increased demands for most products (especially natural resources and other primary products). The shape of the LR supply curve tells us whether real resource prices will increase rapidly over time. The relative slope for different products tells us which prices will rise relative to prices for other goods. E.g., will housing become relatively more or less expensive? LR Supply: Constant cost case LR Supply: Increasing cost case In the above diagram, we have: Initial market equilibrium: P1, Q1 Increase in demand to D’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) price to P2 in SR \\(\\rightarrow\\) firms produce at q2, profit \\(\\rightarrow\\) Profit attracts new firms. \\(\\rightarrow\\) costs rise to the levels shown in (b). \\(\\rightarrow\\) New equilibrium at P3, Q3. Long-run elasticity of supply: % change in LR \\(Q^s\\) / % change P (Various estimates over the years, see text) 8.8 Consumer and producer surplus, efficiency Consumer surplus (reprise) The extra value individuals receive from consuming a good over what they pay for it. What people would be willing to pay for the right to consume a good at its current price. The area between the demand curve and the market price Producer surplus The extra value producers get for a good in excess of the opportunity costs they incur by producing it. What all producers would pay for the right to sell a good at its current market price. The area between the supply curve and the market price Basically producer surplus is profit + unavoidable costs. In the short run you cannot shut down and avoid the fixed costs, whether or not you sell any units. Since you are already incurring these, they don’t count against the benefit you would get from selling at the market price. In the long run, profits are zero, and all costs are variable, so producer surplus is zero76 In what sense is a competitive market efficient? Economically efficient allocation of resources: maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus. - At market equilibrium there are no more mutually beneficial exchanges Basically, a competitive market in equilibrium maximizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. Q* maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus. Any other quantity yields a lower sum. E.g., at Q1 in the above diagram we ‘lose’ the triangle FEG … this is called a ‘deadweight loss’ (‘DWL’) as it is a loss to society, it just disappears. We can use these models and concepts to study things like: ‘Who suffers from a tax’ in the LR and SR? Who gains from technological innovation? Who gains and who is harmed by trade restrictions, and do the costs outweigh the benefits? This is also relevant to rail regulation and music copyright. 8.8.1 Important caveat and discussion point Should price-taking firms and perfect competition be our ‘baseline’ dominant model? Is it reasonable to assume: Free entry of firms/no ‘barriers’? Homogenous products? Decreasing returns to scale at some point? These conditions will indeed lead to perfect competition/MC pricing. But many markets have large entry costs, first-mover advantages, and perhaps continuously increasing returns to scale. This will lead to monopoly or oligopoly in the absence of regulation. Perhaps even more crucially, most products are also ‘differentiated’; if one firm charges slightly more than another firm, it will still capture the demand from those people whose are ‘close’ to it. People will pay a little extra to not travel as far. They will also pay a little extra to get the product that most suits their preferences. In this case, with free entry, we have something known as ‘monopolistic competition’, which has some of the characteristics of monopoly (e.g., pricing above marginal cost) and some characteristics of perfect competition (e.g., zero long-run profits). This model is another candidate for bring the dominant model; there is an active debate about this! 8.9 Suggested practice problems from Nicholson and Snyder Chapter 9 (12th ed) ‘Micro-quizes’ 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, ‘Problems’: - 9.3a and b - 9.5? - 9.9 a-d? Note: in 2019 we are not covering the LR supply curve quite as much↩ This seemed to be an urgent question in 2016 when I first wrote this section. It still seems to be an urgent question.↩ For a further revision, this process is well mapped out in a step-by step Powerpoint you can download: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vyvao528job7q0q/fc.ppt?dl=0 (This is specifically referred to beginning on slide 39; use ‘presentation mode’)↩ For a variety of reasons, we shouldn’t always expect the LR curve to be upward sloping. It might also be flat or downward sloping. Thus, if the demand curve for, e.g., microchips or personalised software shifts out, we may see that equilibrium price declines in the long run.↩ Adv: When a firm owns a unique resource it can arguably make a LR profit called a ‘Ricardian rent’. However this could be seen as the return to an asset which should be ‘charged against’ these profits.↩ "],

However: Some markets may not reach equilibrium ‘quickly’ These conditions may not hold \\(\\rightarrow\\) market failure Efficiency itself does not imply preferred outcomes: there can be a great deal of inequality General Equilibrium analysis considers the entire economy as a system of markets which may interact with one another General equilibrium: a set of prices so that \\(Q_s(P)=Q_d(P)\\) in all markets, including input markets Markets are interdependent E.g., a government push for tomato consumption may shift tomato demand out and prices up this may lead in the LR, to a shift out in tomato supply curves (firms enter) this may increase the demand for inputs such as farm labour, raising the cost of production of other vegetables etc. Will we return to equilibrium, and with what prices and quantities? Stay tuned true believers! (and take more Econ, because we won’t cover it here) 9.3 Pareto efficiency Overall Pareto efficiency: no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off If we could do so, we would not be at an efficient point Pareto efficiency is hard to disagree with, as a policy goal; if we could move to a situation where some were better off and none made worse off, we should do it. 9.4 The three amigos of efficiency: productive, exchange, and top-level Overall efficiency requires several conditions: Productive, Exchange, and Top-level efficiency Efficiency in production (being on the PPF) No way to reallocate inputs to increase production of one good without reducing production of another Given society’s resources, we are producing ‘as much as possible’ Efficiency in production? Note: Basic argument for productive efficiency of competitive equilibrium: Firms hire more of each input until its ‘bang for buck’ is the same as all other inputs, and a single market price for the input will ensure this is the same across firms. This ‘equilibrium’ input price must reflect its marginal productivity in producing the ‘last unit’ for each and every firm. Efficiency in consumption (exchange efficiency) No way to reallocate output amongst consumers to make them all better off Note– Basic argument for productive efficiency of competitive equilibrium: If, given the ‘endowments’, one person values A in units B more than someone else, an equilibrium price ensures that they will trade these amongst one another until each has the same MRS The ‘Edgeworth box’ offers a graphical demonstration that this yields a Pareto optimum (given the amounts produced). 9.4.1 Edgeworth box scavenger hunt Does this look familiar? Where can you find it at Exeter? What does it mean? An equilibrium price ensures that they will trade these amongst one another until each has the same MRS. The ‘Edgeworth box’ offers a graphical demonstration that this yields a Pareto optimum (given the amounts produced). Note: You do not need to know how the Edgeworth box works; we do not have time to cover this. Given our inputs, we can produce ‘efficiently’, i.e, along the PPF, and given the amounts of each good produced, it is ‘consumed by the right people’ (no more room for trade) … yet we may still not be at efficiency? Why? We need to produce the right combination of goods. Efficient allocation of resources (‘top-level’ condition) No way to produce more of one good and less of another to make all consumers better off 9.5 A basic argument for exchange efficiency of competitive equilibrium: Basic argument for top-level efficiency of competitive equilibrium: Equilibrium prices from exchange reflect each consumer’s marginal rates of substitution for their last unit This signals to firms the rate at which all consumers would be willing to trade off A for B at the margin In equilibrium firms produce at a point where the cost tradeoffs between A and B (slope of PPF) reflects these prices. 9.6 Fundamental theorems of welfare economics; market failures First fundamental theorem of welfare economics A general competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient, under standard assumptions. Loose intuition: free exchange leaves no room for mutually-beneficial improvements, and firms and consumers optimise Second fundamental theorem Under some fancy assumptions, any Pareto efficient outcome is a competitive equilibrium for some pattern of initial endowments So if we could costlessly redistribute endowments, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome by doing so, and then relying on the free market. First fundamental theorem of welfare economics A general competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient, under standard assumptions. But these assumptions may not hold, this there may be ‘market failures’ Imperfect Competition Markets may not be competitive, because of barriers to entry or increasing returns to scale \\(\\rightarrow\\) Prices may not reflect marginal costs, leading to ‘deadweight losses’ Externalities, public goods, altruism The assumptions require ‘anything someone values’ is bought and sold in the market on their own behalf. But: Externalities: All costs (and benefits) may not be priced; e.g., pollution Public goods (and bads): Many people may benefit from the same good (e.g., fireworks) Altruism/interdependent utilities: People may care about others’ consumption Asymmetric information: People may have different information about the state of the world (costs, risks, a good’s quality) Bounded rationality: people may not choose in their own best interests Second Welfare theorem implied that if we could costlessly redistribute endowments, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome by doing so, and then relying on the free market. But redistribution via ‘optimal lump-sum’ taxes is not so easy, as endowments may be unobservable And redistribution based on things you can affect, e.g. income, may distort incentives.

I will give you a preview of game theory as we consider these, and we may return to these examples in our game theory section. NS: Ch 16 – public goods section only (skip Lindahl equiliibrium, median voter, single-peaked preferences optional) Key goals of this chunk Learn how economists define a public good Be able to assess whether something fits into this category Understand what ‘market failures are’ Learn and be able to explain why a competitive market will usually undersupply a public good (but may still supply some of it) Understand the difficulties government may face in providing the right amount of a public good Get a sense of the general patterns and evidence on voluntary provision of public goods, including in ‘lab experiments’ and what ‘lab experiments’ in economics are Outline: What is a public good, why do markets fail to provide these optimally, (how) can governments provide these optimally, when do people provide these voluntarily? Motivation Policy: The ‘public goods argument’ is critical to justify many government programmes (military, environmental cleanup, research, etc) Management: Firms/workers can only profit from providing a public good through getting subsidies or by turning it into a private good. Are these questions important? Some people seem to think so: 10.2 Market failures Occur when prices don’t fully reflect the marginal social benefits or costs Provide scope for political intervention How does this happen? One potential source of market failure: Public Goods 10.3 Public Goods (attributes, categories) What are the characteristics of a public good? Def – A Pure Public Good is a good that is both Non-excludable: Once the good is provided, it is impossible/costly to prevent any individual from using/benefiting from it. Note: This even includes individuals who have not paid for it Opposite (and alt definition) Exclusive goods: … a good is exclusive if it is relatively easy to bar people from benefitting from it once it has been produced Non-rival: One person’s consumption doesn’t reduce the quantity available for others. The fact that some people use the good doesn’t prevent others from using the same good. There is no “crowding.” Alt (equivalent def): Providable to additional users at zero marginal (social) cost. Consumption of additional units of the good involves zero marginal social cost of production. (E.g., if we had produced a film but restricted it to subscribers, the marginal social cost of letting the whole world download it is essentially zero; the exclusion would take us away from the ‘utility frontier’) Q: think of some examples. In market economies, private suppliers provide the majority of goods and services to consumers. However, certain goods are publicly provided. These include for example defense, education, and health. Why does the government instead of the market provide these goods? Which characteristics differentiate goods that are privately provided from goods that are publicly provided? How do we define public goods? The terminology might induce the conclusion that ‘public goods are good that are publicly provided as opposed to private goods which are privately provided.’ This conclusion is simply WRONG! The public or private nature of the good is an intrinsic characteristic of goods that is not related to the provider of the good Hence, it may well be that the state provides a private good or that the market provides a public good. ## Examples, In-between’s {-} Excludable and rival (depleatable)? \\(\\rightarrow\\) Private good “Club goods”: excludable but non-rivalrous (at least up to a congestion point). “Common property”: Nonexcludable but rivalrous “Somewhat” nonexcludable and/or “somewhat” nonrival: \\(\\rightarrow\\) “impure public goods.” What about? Recorded music “Information” goods (e.g., software) A national park A theatre performance Roads Clean air Education Aid to the needy Loud music coming from my window Disease control Economic research The justice system Fireworks in Disney World The 2012 Olympics in London 10.4 The basic idea If a good is non-rival then additional provision is costless. Thus, if exclusion is possible, and any positive price is charged, some are deterred from consuming it this is inefficient: people who could benefit from the good, at no cost to others, will not consume it :( If a good is non-excludable it will be difficult to charge people for it many might prefer to wait for others to buy it, and then they enjoy it anyways (free-ride), which could lead to coordination problems and… Even if each person provided it for their own benefit (on the assumption that no one else would), they would typically choose too little from a social POV… Considering their own marginal benefits (and MRS) versus the price or cost, not the social marginal benefit (essentially, a positive externality) But if firms cannot charge for its full value, they might not pay the fixed costs to develop/build/provide it Who would pay to produce a film that is freely pirated/distributed? Who would pay to develop a drug that must be priced at its marginal cost? Why contribute to police protection for your village, if your neighbours will pay for it anyways? Note: Loosely, ‘rivalryness’ basically relates to whether market provision will be efficient; ‘excludability’ tells you whether firms can make some revenue from providing it, selling the same prooduced good to more than one person (or to a ‘club’ of people) Application: drug development Drug R&amp;D may be a public good, or a common resource Expensive to develop and introduce a new drug – ‘sunk costs’ once developed But cheap to copy and produce; without patent protection may have \\(P=mc\\) and no ex-post profit to compensate for sunk costs \\(\\rightarrow\\) No incentive to develop drugs without patent protection guaranteeing ‘excludability’ and a limited monopoly But ex-post, patent protection is costly; drug produced for a few pennies sold for £1000’s People may not buy, or NHS may not cover \\(\\rightarrow\\) Inefficient: some consumers may value drug at £100’s, far above MC, yet they don’t consume it Possible solution: Government awards and subsidies for drug development. Note: In fact, governments do fund and subsidise R&amp;D. But there are difficulties here too. Governments may free-ride off of other governments. It is also for government to know whom to fund, hard to quantify the benefits to potential drugs, and offering ‘prizes’ to developers offers its own challenges: how to asses if the drug is good enough to deserve the prize? And too many firms working on the same drug may be wasteful. "],

First problem set with suggested answers Mathematical approaches, economic models, revision and warm-up We will cover key parts of this problem set in the first tutorial (as well as part of the second problem set). However, you should aim to be able to do and understand all of the material on the assigned problem sets. Goals of this problem set: Re-acquaintance with mathematical approaches to Economics (e.g., simultaneous equations, graphing functions) Revising the supply and demand model and its implications, applying this to real-world problems, considering empirical approaces Understanding the logic of ‘difficult’ multiple choice questions (assessment tips) Discussing and writing a coherent response to applied Economics questions Problem 1: drawing demand and supply, computation 1.1.A: Graph the points of these supply and demand curves for orange juice. Be sure to put price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. (If this is tedious, just graph three points for each). Ans: 1.1.B: Do these points lie along two straight lines? If so, figure out the precise algebraic equation of these lines. (Hint: If the points do lie on straight lines, you need only consider two points on each of them to calculate the lines.) Extended answer: Yes, they do. The ‘rise over run’ between any two points is the same. (To confirm this fully, we should check this for all point pairs, even if I didn’t do this in tutorial. Another way of saying this is that they should all fit into this same linear algebraic equation) E.g., for supply, when price rises from 1 to 2, quantity supplied rises from 100 to 300, for a ‘rise over run’ of 200/1=200. OK, as we plot price on the vertical axis, we could say that the ‘rise’ is the rise in price of 2-1=1 and the ‘run’ is the rise in quantity supplied or 300-100=200, for a ‘rise over run’ of 1/200. For any other pair of points on this supply curve this is the same; e.g as price rises from 3 to 5, \\(Q_s\\) rises from 500 to 900, for a ‘rise over run’ of \\(5-3/900-500 = 2/400=1/200\\) For the demand curve we could make similar calculations but the slopes will be negative. Now to figure out the algebraic equation… (Recall GCSE maths formula for straight line: \\(y=mx+b\\)) This is a linear function \\(P = a+bQ\\) (when we get to demand, we allow \\(b\\) to be negative) Essentially repeating the above ‘rise over run’ calculation’… For supply, increase P by 1 and Q increases by 200. (See diagram) i.e, for \\(\\Delta P = 1\\), \\(\\Delta Q = 200\\) … implying that if price were to increase by 1, firms would be willing to provide 200 more units in total Doing this more carefully … if we have any two points, \\(x_1,y_1\\) and \\(x_2,y_2\\) we can compute the slope \\(m= \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\), again ‘rise over run’. Take any two points on the supply curve (the table above), and compute this to get the slope. E.g., \\((P_1,Q_1)\\) = \\((1,100)\\) and \\((P_2,Q_2)\\)=\\((2,300)\\). The slope is thus \\(\\frac{(300-100)}{(2-1)}=200.\\) as stated above. However, this is the slope of \\(Q\\) in \\(P\\). Confusingly, although economists usually consider how \\(Q\\) changes in \\(P\\) along supply (or demand curves), our convention is to plot \\(P\\) on the vertical axis an \\(Q\\) on the horizontal. So, when drawing the slope, remember to keep this straight. If the slope of Q in P is 200, the slope of P in Q is actually the inverse of this, namely \\(1/200\\). (Check: \\(\\frac{P_2-P_1}{Q2-Q1}=1/200\\)). Also note that a slope of \\(1/200\\) would look almost flat, so it’s better to make the quantity axis in units of 100, so you can do a slope of 1/2 (vertical increase of 1 units for each 2 units of horizontal increase). Thus \\(\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\Delta Q} = \\frac{1}{200}\\) We know the slope \\(b=\\frac{1}{200}\\) \\(\\rightarrow P = a + \\frac{q}{200}\\) What about the intercept \\(a\\)? Just plug some value into the formula and solve for this. at \\(P=2\\), \\(Q=300\\) \\(\\rightarrow 2 = a + \\frac{300}{200} = a + \\frac{3}{2}\\) so \\(a = \\frac{1}{2}\\) Thus the equation is \\(P = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{Q_s}{200}\\) - or \\(Q_s=200P-100\\) Check: does this equation describe the graph? Is it intuitive? Supply upward-sloping in price. Intercept: \\(P&gt;1/2\\) necessary for a positive quantity supplied. For demand, increase P by 1 and Q declines by 100. Solves similarly to above: \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(P=8-\\frac{Q_d}{100}\\) or \\(Q_d=800-100p\\) This was the intuitive way. Another way to do this is to simply plug two points into \\(P = a+bQ\\) and solve these equations: Start with the point \\(P=1, Q=100\\) \\[1 = a+b\\times 100 \\leftrightarrow\\] \\[1 - a = b\\times 100 \\leftrightarrow\\] \\[b = (1 - a)/100\\] Now we plug this expression for b (the slope) into the formula at another point, the point \\(P=2, Q=300\\). \\[2 = a+b\\times 300\\] Plugging in \\(b=(1 - a)/100\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\[2 = a + \\frac{1 - a}{100} \\times 300 = a + 3(1 - a) = 3-2a\\] \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) \\[1=2a \\leftrightarrow a = 1/2\\] Now we can plug this in to solve for b: \\[b = (1 - a)/100 = \\frac{1}{2}/100 = 1/200\\] Again, this yields the supply curve \\(P = 1/2 + Q/200\\) which is the same as \\(Q_s=200P-100\\) 1.1.C: Use your solutions from part b to calculate the “excess demand” for orange juice if the (imposed) market price is zero Note that for the supply curve, quantity supplied is never negative – below a certain price, it will just be zero. Consider: (why) does this make sense? *More technically, firms choose among their feasible ‘production sets’, which must be non-negative. Ans: Draw these functions on the same graph to aid intuition \\(Q_s(P)=200P-100\\), at \\(P=0\\), \\(Q_s = -100\\) we must not forget that we actually mean \\(Q_s(p)=max(0,200P-100)\\), so \\(Q_s(0) = 0\\) \\(Q_d(P)=800-100P\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(Q_d(0)=800\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) Excess demand at \\(P = 0\\) is \\(Q_d(0)-Q_s(0)=800-0 = 800\\). Consider: does this make sense? If the government declared ‘orange juice must be free’ and imposed no subsidies, would you expect there to be excess demand? 1.1.D: Use your solutions from part b to calculate the “excess supply” for orange juice if the orange juice price is $6 per gallon. Ans: Excess supply at \\(P=6\\) is 900 (This is a very similar question as the previous part.) MCQs from previous exams, slightly adjusted (these were some of the hardest ones, they are not all so difficult) MCQ2 True or False: One example of microdata is a set of over 5 million observations of income, hours worked, and demographic information from over 1 million households’ tax returns over five years. Answer:; True. Microdata refers to the level of the unit of observation; the economic decision-maker, such as an individual or household, rather than an aggregation, such as an entire country or market. 65% got this one right. Note77 Note – this was covered in the mini-lecture ‘Empirical microeconomics/econometrics’ as well as in the text. Again, this is a ‘challenge question’; if you read carefully, and read the suggested applications and additional readings, you should be able to get most of these questions. However, I don’t expect everyone will get these right, so I will limit the number of such questions so that you can still get a good mark without knowing these. I want you to have more than just a ‘textbook theoretical’ understanding. Understanding how data is used in business, economic analysis, and policy, will be very important in your career! MCQ3 True or false: It is valid to plot observed prices and quantities traded in a market and fit a line through them to estimate a market demand curve. Answer: False. \"If we plot prices and quantities traded in a market, we are be observing the interaction of shifts in supply and demand curve, so it is difficult to estimate either curve without further assumptions. About 30% got this one right. Again, this is a challenge question. Remember: I will ask some questions where the answer is not ‘common-sense’ answer that someone who has not taken Economics would give. And this is what you should want: if you study and engage, you should understand more after taking this module than you did when you started it! My video discussing a related question here MCQ4 (Choose all that are correct): The slope of the production possibility frontier shows how inputs must be changed to keep them fully employed. shows consumers are willing to trade one good for another. shows the opportunity cost of one good in terms of the other. is typically negative shows the returns to scale Answer: shows the opportunity cost of one good in terms of the other. AND is typically negative MCQ5: True or false: If people who attended university earn more than those who did not, this proves that university makes people more productive. Answer: False. Those who attended university may have had a greater potential to earn money whether or not they actually attended university. They may have been more skilled, hardworking, etc. If we had a clean experiment randomly assigning people to university we might be able to credibly assert that attending university did cause later outcomes, and perhaps caused these people to earn more money. However, we still would not that this occurred through the channel of making people more productive. There are other reasons why completing university may increase income other than ‘making people more productive’. Discussion questions Consider the following statement: Gasoline sells for $4.00 per gallon this year, and it sold for $3.00 per gallon last year. But consumers bought more gasoline this year than they did last year. This is clear proof that the economic theory that people buy less when the price rises is incorrect. Do you agree? Explain. Ans: Other things may have changed, including tastes, income, the population; these could shift the market demand curve. This does not invalidate the more general proposition that ‘in aggregate people are willing to buy fewer units at a higher price rises, all else equal’ nor that ‘when a shift in the supply curve (or costs) means that firms to require a higher price for each unit, this leads to an equilibrium in which a lower quantity is exchanged (at a higher price)’ The point is you need to focus on the equilibrium price here. Second problem set: Preferences, Utility, Consumer optimization Mainly from NS chapter 2-3. We will cover key parts of this problem set in the first and second tutorials. However, you should aim to be able to do and understand all of the material on the assigned problem sets. Goals of this problem set: (Exam skills) – further understanding of how to hack difficult MCQs learning how to answer a range of ‘consumer optimization problem’ questions; algebraically, graphically, short answer building the ability to connect intuition, graphs, and algebra, and explain this coherently (More difficult) MCQ’s (some are from previous midterms, adapted to a new format) We will not go over all of these MCQs in the tutorial, but we will try to go over any of these that you have questions about, after reading the suggested answer.

Maximising a utility function \\(U(x,y)\\) subject to a budget constraint \\(p_xX + p_yY \\leq I\\) will yield the same choices (of x and y) as maximising the utility function \\(2U(x,y)\\) (doubling the previous utility function) subject to the same budget constraint. D. Maximising a utility function subject to the budget constraint \\(100p_xX + 100p_yY \\leq 100\\) will yield the same consumption of x and y as maximising this utility function subject to the budget constraint \\(100p_xX + 100p_yY \\leq 200\\) E. We can precisely estimate an individuals’ utility function by measuring their consumption Steak and beer (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) Suppose for a particular consumption plan an individual’s MRS (of steak for beer) is 3. That is, at this consumption plan he or she would be willing to give up 3 beers to get an extra steak. Suppose also that the price of a steak is £1 and a beer is £0.25 (i.e,. 25p) A. This plan may be optimal if it involves buying only beer and no steak. B. This plan may be optimal if it involves buying only steak no beer. C. If this plan involves a positive amount of beer and steak, it is not optimal: the individual would prefer to buy more beer and less steak. D. If this plan involves a positive amount of beer and steak, it is not optimal: the individual would prefer to buy more steak and less beer. E. This plan is certainly optimal. Extra practice to aid understanding: - Draw this using indifference curves and a budget constraint, considering each of the cases (‘positive amount of each, only one, only the other’) Ticket scalping (Choose TWO. For questions like these partial credit will NOT be awarded.) Suppose the NFL had a ‘rationing policy’, where each consumer could buy at most one ticket to the Super Bowl. Suppose the diagram above represents each consumer’s budget constraint and two of her indifference curves. The maximum amount she would be willing to pay to buy an additional (second) ticket is characterised by the vertical distance between ____ and ____ (choose two): A B C D Individual optimisation solved problem John M. Countryside makes £50 per week at his summer job and spends his entire weekly income on leeks and chocolate, because these are the only two items that provide utility to him. John gains utility from both of these; his utility is \\(U(\\ell,c)=c^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ell^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\), where \\(\\ell\\) is the number of ounces of leeks he consumes and \\(c\\) the number of ounces of chocolate he consumes. a. If leeks costs £2 per ounce and chocolates cost £1 per ounce, how many will John buy of each in a week? Please show your steps: state the optimisation condition and constraint and then solve. Recall the power rule for derivatives: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}ax^{b}=bax^{b-1}\\) where \\(b\\neq0\\). Now suppose that the price of chocolate rises to £2 per ounce. How many of each will he buy? Plot (a relevant set of) John’s indifference curves and his budget constraints before and after this change. Explain, using the diagram, why he chose to reallocate. Note that even though the midterm is MCQ there are still ways I can still ask about things like this … E.g., I could present several diagrams and ask ’which of the following correctly depicts this budget constraint and indifference curves representing these preferences’? Furthermore, I have tended to ask questions like this on the final exam. Second problem set with suggested answers: Preferences, Utility, Consumer optimization Mainly from NS chapter 2-3. We will cover key parts of this problem set in the first and second tutorials. However, you should aim to be able to do and understand all of the material on the assigned problem sets. Goals of this problem set: (Exam skills) – further understanding of how to hack difficult MCQs learning how to answer a range of ‘consumer optimization problem’ questions; algebraically, graphically, short answer building the ability to connect intuition, graphs, and algebra, and explain this coherently (More difficult) MCQ’s (some are from previous midterms, adapted to a new format) We will not go over all of these MCQs in the tutorial, but we will try to go over any of these that you have questions about, after reading the suggested answer. When is it reasonable to think that people obey a utility function. . . ? (Choose ALL THAT APPLY, and no more). We can represent a person’s preferences with a continuous utility function even if A. their preferences violate transitivity B. they prefer more of one good over less of that good C. they are unemployed D. they dislike chicken E. they cannot state a preference nor make a choice between many categories of goods Suggested answer b,c,d. Transitivity and complete preferences (violated in a and e) are required axioms to have a utility representation. Monotonicity (b) is a common assumption for preferences and utility functions Unemployed people have preferences and utility functions just as do everyone else. Even someone with no income may have a utility function. You can dislike any good, even chicken, and have a utility function … that good will simply not enter into this function (or it may enter negatively if it’s a ‘bad’). Maximising a utility function and comparing utilities According to the standard classical assumptions over utility functions and over budget constraints: A. We can meaningfully state ‘person A gets more utility than person B’. B. Utility functions cannot be stated in terms of more than two goods C. Maximising a utility function \\(U(x,y)\\) subject to a budget constraint \\(p_xX + p_yY \\leq I\\) will yield the same choices (of x and y) as maximising the utility function \\(2U(x,y)\\) (doubling the previous utility function) subject to the same budget constraint. D. Maximising a utility function subject to the budget constraint \\(100p_xX + 100p_yY \\leq 100\\) will yield the same consumption of x and y as maximising this utility function subject to the budget constraint \\(100p_xX + 100p_yY \\leq 200\\) E. We can precisely estimate an individuals’ utility function by measuring their consumption Suggested answer TRUE: Maximising a utility function \\(U(x,y)\\) subject to a budget constraint \\(p_xX + p_yY \\leq I\\) will yield the same choices (of x and y) as maximising the utility function \\(2U(x,y)\\) (doubling the previous utility function) subject to the same budget constraint. Why? Ordinal utility functions are only identified up to a monotonic transformation. So doubling a utility function leads to the same choices FALSE: (a): False because we cannot compare ordinal utility across individuals (because it’s only identified up to a monotonic transformation) (b): False because Utility functions can be stated in terms of as many goods, services, and activities as you like. (Indifference curves are hard to depict in more than 2-3 goods, however) (d): False: It’s true that demand function is homogenous of degree zero; however, here we did multiply prices and income by the same amount – we only changed income False: While we can identify some elements of preferences by observing an individual’s choices Steak and beer (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) Suppose for a particular consumption plan an individual’s MRS (of steak for beer) is 3. That is, at this consumption plan he or she would be willing to give up 3 beers to get an extra steak. Suppose also that the price of a steak is £1 and a beer is £0.25 (i.e,. 25p) A. This plan may be optimal if it involves buying only beer and no steak. B. This plan may be optimal if it involves buying only steak no beer. C. If this plan involves a positive amount of beer and steak, it is not optimal: the individual would prefer to buy more beer and less steak. D. If this plan involves a positive amount of beer and steak, it is not optimal: the individual would prefer to buy more steak and less beer. E. This plan is certainly optimal. Suggested answer - This plan may be optimal if it involves buying only beer and no steak. - If this plan involves a positive amount of beer and steak, it is not optimal: the individual would prefer to buy more beer and less steak. Let’s skip the formulae and just reason. At her current level of consumption, steak is three times as valuable to her as beer (per unit), yet it costs four times as much per unit. At the margin, every pound she spends, she can buy one steak or four beers; the latter would yield twice as much utility. This means she should buy more beer and less steak. As she does this, the MU of beer will decline, and the MU of steak will increase … and she should keep making this shift until the rate she is willing to trade off steak to obtain beer is ‘1 steak per 4 beers’, reflecting the price ratio. However, if this point already represents “only buying beer and not steak” she cannot buy less than no steak. The tricky thing here is that at the point mentioned, steak is providing 3x as much utility ‘per unit’, but it costs 4 times as much, so the ‘bang for the buck’ is lower. Extra practice to aid understanding: - Draw this using indifference curves and a budget constraint, considering each of the cases (‘positive amount of each, only one, only the other’) I made a video on some related questions here Ticket scalping (Choose TWO. For questions like these partial credit will NOT be awarded.) Suppose the NFL had a ‘rationing policy’, where each consumer could buy at most one ticket to the Super Bowl. Suppose the diagram above represents each consumer’s budget constraint and two of her indifference curves. The maximum amount she would be willing to pay to buy an additional (second) ticket is characterised by the vertical distance between ____ and ____ (choose two): A B C D Ans: B and D Paying the vertical distance between B and D (sacrificing this amount of ‘other goods’) to obtain the second ticket will leave her at point D. This is on the same indifference curve aas point B so this leaves her equally well off. Thus this is the most she would be willing to pay for the second ticket. Individual optimisation solved problem John M. Countryside makes £50 per week at his summer job and spends his entire weekly income on leeks and chocolate, because these are the only two items that provide utility to him. John gains utility from both of these; his utility is \\(U(\\ell,c)=c^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ell^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\), where \\(\\ell\\) is the number of ounces of leeks he consumes and \\(c\\) the number of ounces of chocolate he consumes. a. If leeks costs £2 per ounce and chocolates cost £1 per ounce, how many will John buy of each in a week? Please show your steps: state the optimisation condition and constraint and then solve. Recall the power rule for derivatives: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}ax^{b}=bax^{b-1}\\) where \\(b\\neq0\\). Suggested answer \\(MU_{\\ell}={\\frac{2}{3}}c^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ell^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\) \\(MU_{c}={\\frac{1}{3}}c^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\ell^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\) For optimisation (where the second order condition holds, and where we consume some of both so it’s not a corner solution; this will be the case here, points may be awarded here if anyone mentions this and more if they derive it): \\(MU_{\\ell}/MU_{c}=MRS=p_{\\ell}/p_{c}\\) \\(\\rightarrow{\\frac{2}{3}}c^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ell^{-\\frac{1}{3}}/{\\frac{1}{3}}c^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\ell^{\\frac{2}{3}}=\\frac{2}{1}\\) \\(\\rightarrow2c^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ell^{-\\frac{1}{3}}/c^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\ell^{\\frac{2}{3}}=2\\) \\(\\rightarrow c\\ell^{-1}=1\\) \\(\\rightarrow c=\\ell\\) A slightly simpler way would have been to first make a monotonic transformation of the utility function, cubing it: \\((U(\\ell,c))^{3}=(c^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ell^{\\frac{2}{3}})^{3}=c\\ell^{2}\\). Then \\(MU_{\\ell}=2c\\ell\\) and \\(MU_{c}=\\ell^{2}\\), implying \\(MU_{\\ell}/MU_{c}=2c\\ell/l^{2}=2c/\\ell\\)… set equal to the price ratio \\(2c/\\ell=2\\rightarrow c=\\ell\\). Partial credit: We also know the above is a Cobb-Douglas utility function so expenditure shares will be constant and reflect the relative power coefficients; as the coefficient on \\(\\ell\\) is twice that on c, we will spend twice as much on \\(\\ell\\), which, as it is twice as expensive, means buying the same amount of each. Budget constraint: \\(2\\ell+c=50\\) Substituting in: \\(2\\ell+ \\ell=50\\rightarrow3\\ell=50\\rightarrow \\ell =50/3}\\) \\(c=\\ell=50/3\\) (Side note, you might argue leeks are ‘discrete’ and not continuous)78 Check all the budget is spent: \\(2(50/3)+1(50/3)=50\\) Now suppose that the price of chocolate rises to £2 per ounce. How many of each will he buy? Plot (a relevant set of) John’s indifference curves and his budget constraints before and after this change. Explain, using the diagram, why he chose to reallocate. Suggested answer \\(MU_{\\ell}/MU_{c}=MRS=2c\\ell/l^{2}=2c/\\ell\\) still holds Set it equal to the new price ratio: \\(2c/\\ell=1 \\rightarrow c=\\ell/2}\\) New budget constraint: \\(2\\ell+2c=50\\) Substituting in: \\(2\\ell+\\ell=50\\rightarrow\\ell=50/3 \\rightarrow c=\\frac{50}{6}\\) … (costs 100/3+50/3=150/3=50 … so it adds up) Note that even though the midterm is MCQ there are still ways I can still ask about things like this … E.g., I could present several diagrams and ask ’which of the following correctly depicts this budget constraint and indifference curves representing these preferences’? Furthermore, I have tended to ask questions like this on the final exam. Mock mid-term exam This MOCK test consists entirely of multiple choice questions. Please allocate your time wisely among these. Note that not all of these questions are worth the same amount: this is clearly indicated below. Answer multiple choice questions on MCQ answer sheet. 11.0.1 (skip this) 11.0.2 Choose ONE. Which of the following best represents ‘repeated cross-sectional firm-level micro-data that may be used to test whether firms that engage in CSR (corporate social responsibility) activities tend to be in more heavily-regulated industries’? A table of the average number of employees engaged in CSR per firm, estimates of the regulatory involvment, and amount spent on political lobbying in 2017, aggregated across the largest employment sectors: professional services, manufacturing, and retail. A data set with ten observations, one for each of the years 2010-2018 for a single small firm. Each observation (row) contains ten variables (columns) detailing the CSR expenditure, profit, and estimated regulatory burden for this firm, based on a survey on their CSR activities and spending, cross-checked against their public financial reportings. A dataset of US firms between the years 1990-2015. Each year a different representative sample of 1000 firms are chosen and given a survey on their CSR activities and spending, cross-checked against their public financial reportings. Each firm’s 4-digit SIC industry code is reported and merged to an independent measure of regulatory burden by industry by year. A dataset of individual tax reportings (income, asset balances and liabilities, corporate taxes paid, dividends paid, inventory depreciation, loan interest, salaries and national insurance payments, and tax-favored capital investment and research) from all small UK firms between the years 1950-2015. An excerpt of the findings from a report on the tax and regulatory burden and CSR activities of EU-based firms between 1970 and 2015. Correct: A dataset of US firms between the years 1990-2015. Each year a different representative sample of 1000 firms are chosen and given a survey on their CSR activities and spending, cross-checked against their public financial reportings. Each firm’s 4-digit SIC industry code is reported and merged to an independent measure of regulatory burden by industry by year. Note, the other choices depict, respectively: a. aggregated data (not micro-data, not firm-level data) b. a panel dataset not repeated cross-section. Also not particular useful for testing this relationship; one firm will not lead to any variation in ‘which industry’ d. Panel data. More importantly, it doesn’t seem to have any information on CSR or on regulatory burden. e. This is a *report* not data. By the way, note that the question about CSR is not a ‘causal question’; just a question about an observed relationship. 11.0.3 (Choose ONE) Which of the following fields of Economics typically uses the most pure mathematics? Applied microeconomics Empirical labour economics Microeconomic theory Macroeconomics of growth Development economics Microeconomic theory. Although you may be used to thinking of ‘theory’ as a bunch of woolly verbiage, in Economics it involves very formal mathematics (especially Real Analysis) and logic. 11.0.4 (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) Suppose we observe prices and quantities traded in a market over a period of time. In such a case, fitting a line through these points will provide a reasonable valid estimate of a market supply curve... (Choose ALL that are necessary for this.) if the supply curve was constant over this period. if this was a period when the demand curve was constant and the supply curve was shifting. if this data pertains to several dissimilar products, and we cannot separate these products in the data set. if the demand curve shifted over this period. if the supply curve is approximately linear. TRUE: a. if the supply curve was constant over this period. if the demand curve shifted over this period. if the supply curve is approximately linear. False: “if this was a period when the demand curve was constant and the supply curve was shifting.” — this is a condition for estimating a demand curve not a supply curve. “if this data pertains to several dissimilar products, and we cannot separate these products in the data set.” —With several unrelated products it is unclear what this relationship would be depicting See my youtube video on a related question HERE 11.0.5 Choose ONE. Suppose that, over a number of years, a country randomly (by lottery) selected people from an eligible pool to attend university, and all who were selected attended university, and all who were not selected did not attend any university. Suppose that, for this country, on average those who attended university earned significantly more than those who did not. In such a case, which of the following statements is most correct? This offers no valid evidence on the income returns to education because correlation is not causation. This provides substantial evidence that attending university leads to higher wages, at least in the context of this country. This proves that if one’s parents earn a higher wage one is more likely to attend university, at least in the context of this country. This provides substantial evidence that education is a luxury good. None of the above TRUE: (b) This provides substantial evidence that attending university leads to higher wages, at least in the context of this country. Discussion: This seems to describe an ideal ‘natural experiment’ for testing the impact of attending university on earnings, all else equal. In this case it is reasonable to infer a causal relationship! FALSE: all other answers... Yes, ‘correlation is not causation’ but that doesn’t invalidate this evidence. ... There was nothing mentioned about parents... A luxury good is basically one where a “1%” increase in income leads to a larger than 1% increase in amount of the good consumed. ... here the causality is in the opposite direction, and anyways this is a different issue. UTILITY AND CHOICE 11.0.6 (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) According to the standard classical assumptions over ordinal utility functions and over budget constraints: We can observe whether an individual’s utility increases over time by recording their happiness. Utility functions are expressed as a direct function of prices and income, holding the quantity of goods consumed \\((x_1,x_2,...,x_n\\)) constant . For a utility function in \\(n\\) goods \\(u(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)\\) the combinations of \\((x_1,x_2,...x_n)\\) that yield a particular utility level all lie on the same ‘indifference curve.’ An individual utility function implies an infinite number of indifference curves. Utility functions are ‘homogenous of degree zero’: doubling all arguments will lead to the same level of utility. Maximising a utility function \\(U(x,y)\\) subject to a budget constraint \\(p_xX + p_yY \\leq I\\) will yield the same choices (of x and y) as maximizing this same utility function subject to the budget constraint \\(100p_xX + 100p_yY \\leq I\\), i.e, multiplying prices by 100 but leaving income unchanged. TRUE: c. For a utility function in \\(n\\) goods \\(u(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)\\) the combinations of \\((x_1,x_2,...x_n)\\) that yield a particular utility level all lie on the same ‘indifference curve.’ An individual utility function implies an infinite number of indifference curves. Other answers are false... respectively a. The standard view of utility functions is that they are *not* directly measurable b. No, utility functions are a function of the goods and services consumed. (Here we are describing *indirect* utility, which we did not cover) d. Utility functions are not Homogenous of degree zero (*demand functions* are) e. The statement would only be correct if we *also* multiplied income by 100. Otherwise they certainly cannot choose the same amounts of each , they wouldn’t be able to afford it. 11.0.7 Choose TWO. Partial credit will NOT be awarded. Suppose the NFL had a ‘rationing policy’, where each consumer could buy at most one ticket to the Super Bowl. Suppose the diagram above represents each consumer’s budget constraint and two of her indifference curves. The maximum amount she would be willing to pay to buy an additional (second) ticket is characterised by the vertical distance between (______________) and (____________) (choose two): A B C D Ans: B and D Discussion: Paying an additional amount equal to the vertical distance between B-D (giving up this amount of ‘other goods’) and obtaining a second ticket would put her at point D. This point leaves her as well off as the point she was at before, point B. Thus this is the most she would pay for the second ticket. 11.0.8 (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) Considering the above indifference curve, which of the following are true? At point A she is willing to give up approximately 2 hamburgers to gain 1 soft drink. At point D she is willing to give up more than one hamburger to gain one soft drink. For this consumer, these goods are perfect complements, although not at a 1-1 ratio. This consumer would strictly prefer to consume at point C than to consume at point A. The indifference curve demonstrates an diminishing marginal rate of substitution between the two goods; at a higher level of hamburger consumption, she requires fewer soft drinks to be willing to give up a hamburger. True statements: At point A she is willing to give up approximately 2 hamburgers to gain 1 soft drink and The indifference curve demonstrates an diminishing marginal rate of substitution between the two goods; at a higher level of hamburger consumption, she requires fewer soft drinks to be willing to give up a hamburger. 11.0.9 If, starting from any level of consumption (with a positive consumption of plankton), a individual can hold her utility constant by reducing her consumption of plankton by 1 and increasing her consumption of algae by 10, then, for this individual, algae and plankton are (select only one): perfect substitutes perfect complements complements (but not perfect complements) substitutes (but not perfect substitutes) inferior goods perfect substitutes. Note: remember that perfect substitutes require the MRS to be a constant ratio, but that ratio need not be 1:1. DEMAND, ITS DERIVATION AND ITS PROPERTIES 11.0.10 (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) The diagram above depicts two of an individual’s indifference curves and depicts her budget constraint before and after a price decrease, as well as the compensated budget constraint at the initial point. For this individual, within this range of prices, and for this income level, we know that good X (Clarification: good X is the good depicted on the horizontal axis) can be classified as: a normal good an inferior good a Giffen good a useless good a luxury good an inferior good Discussion: The movement between the choice made given the (hypothetical) budget constraint SC and the actual ‘new’ budget constraint BC2 depicts the income effect of the price change. Note that this movement is the same as would occur from an increase in income given the new price ratio. Over this range we see that this ‘hypothetical increase in income’ leads to a decrease in consumption of the X good... the horizontal movement from B to C. Thus in this range it’s an inferior good. Note that as it’s inferior it cannot be normal or luxury. However, the net effect of decrease in the price of the X good (including substitution and income effects) is the movement from A to C. This is an increase in the consumption of the X good, so it is not Giffen. (The substitution effect outweighed the income effect.) The x good is not ‘useless’ as the indifference curves are not horizontal. 11.0.11 Choose ONE. Which of the following functional forms for utility suggests the greatest substitution effect of a 0.20 increase in the price of X when starting from the point where \\(P_X =P_Y-0.10\\)? \\(U(X,Y) =2X+2Y\\) \\(U(X,Y) = XY\\) \\(U(X,Y) = 2 \\times min(X,Y)\\) \\(U(X,Y)=X^4Y^3\\) \\(U(X,Y)=Y\\) \\(U=2X+2Y\\) Discussion: This is a challenging question. We can rule out some of these immediately. \\(U(X,Y)=Y\\) implies only good Y is valued, so no substitution is possible... and in fact the price change in X will have no impact \\(U(X,Y) = 2 \\times min(X,Y)\\) represents perfect complements (at ratio A.1); we know there is no substitution effect here as there is only a single point (the vertex of the L-shaped indifference) curve that yields a particular level of utility at the minimum cost. Choice (a) \\(U(X,Y) =2X+2Y\\) stands out. This is ‘perfect substitutes’ (here at ratio 1:1) . For this case the consumer chooses the good with greater ‘bang for the buck’ (MU/p). Either this ‘better BftB’ is the same before and after the price change (in which case there’s no change), or it switches to the other good, leading to the ‘maximum possible substitution.’ Here both X and Y have the same MU, so the consumer will simply choose the cheaper one. Before the increase X was cheaper, but afterwards Y is cheaper. \\(\\rightarrow\\) maximum possible substitution! Finally, consider the utility functions \\(U(X,Y) = XY\\) and \\(U(X,Y)=X^4Y^3\\). These are basically U-shaped (in fact they are Cobb-douglas), so there will be some substitution effect. However, for these, for any positive price of each good a positive amount of each will be consumed. (Why? Because otherwise you get no utility!) So the substitution will not be ‘a complete switch from one good to the other.’ 11.0.12 (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) Suppose, at a particular consumption choice that an individual is considering, her MRS (of cider for beer) is 2:1. That is, at this point under consideration she is willing to give up 2 ciders to gain an extra beer. This choice is definitely *not* optimal if the price of beer is less than the price of cider, and the choice being considered involves a positive amount of cider. the price of beer is more than twice the price of cider, and this choice involves consuming both beer and cider. the price of beer is more than three times the price of cider there are goods that give her utility other than beer and cider. the price of beer is exactly twice that of cider. NOT optimal if: the price of beer is less than the price of cider, and the choice being considered involves a positive amount of cider. Nor if the price of beer is more than twice the price of cider, and this choice involves consuming both beer and cider. (or actually, if it involves consuming any beer) Discussion: At this point, at the margin (i.e., considering very small adjustments) she values beer twice as much as cider. Thus, if this point involves consuming both beer and cider, it can only be optimal if the price of beer is twice that of cider. If the relative price of beer:cider is less than 2:1 she should move towards consuming more beer and less cider. If the relative price appears more than this, she should move towards consuming less beer and more cider. However, if the price of beer is less than twice that of cider and she is consuming no cider than this still may be optimal as she cannot consume ‘less than zero cider’. Similarly, if the price of beer is more than twice that of cider and she is consuming no beer than this still may be optimal as she cannot consume ‘less than zero beer’. Remember to read the questions carefully; note that this question is asking for conditions such that a particular choice is NOT optimal. 11.0.13 (Choose ONE) Suppose the economy consists of five consumers, each of whom have an individual demand curve for figs equal to \\(q_d(p) = 10-p\\). Which of the following represents the market demand for figs: \\(Q_d = 10-p\\) \\(Q_d = 10-p\\) \\(Q_d = 50-5p\\) \\(Q_d = 50-p\\) \\(Q_d = 50\\) \\(Q_d = 50-5p\\) Discussion: we simply sum the demand curves ‘horizontally’ ... I.e., at every price add the quantity demanded by each of the five consumers, so \\(Q_d = 5 \\times q_d(p) = 5 \\times(10-p) = 50-5p.\\) 11.0.14 (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) Which of the following will NOT shift the market demand curve for good X, \\(Q^{d}(X)\\)? The price of good X rises. The price of another good Y falls The wealthiest 10% of consumers see their income fall by £10,000 each, while the least wealthy 90% of consumers see their income rise by £10,000 each, leading to no change in total income Consumers’ preference for good X changes Costs of producing good X fall, shifting the supply curve Correct choices = things that will NOT shift \\(Q^{d}(X)\\): (a) The price of good X rises – NO, this represents a movement along the demand curve for X AND (e) Costs of producing good X fall, shifting the supply curve – NO the shift in the supply curve doesn’t enter into the market demand curve Incorrect choices = things that will or might shift \\(Q^{d}(X)\\): The price of another good Y falls: if the goods are complements then \\(Q^{d}(X)\\) will shift out— more quantity of X demanded at every price \\(P_X\\). If the goods are substitutes than \\(Q^{d}(X)\\) will shift inwards. The wealthiest 10% of consumers... : as we’ve noted even if average income does not change a shift in the composition of income may impact the demand curve... Here we see a redistribution of income towards the wealthy. If X is a luxury good (in the relevant range) this should shift the demand curve outwards; if it’s a necessity (or even more extreme, an inferior good) this will shift it inwards. Consumers’ preference for good X changes: Obviously this shifts the demand curve 11.0.15 (Choose ONE) Should a price-setting firm ever set its price at a point where demand is inelastic? Why or why not? Yes, because if demand were elastic, a rise in price would reduce quantity and thus reduce revenue. Yes, because revenue is maximized where demand is the most inelastic. No, because if it were at such a point, it could lower its price and its revenue would increase and costs would decline. No, because if it were at such a point, it could raise its price and its revenue would increase and costs would decline. No, because if it were at such a point, it could raise its price and its revenue would increase and costs would decline. Discussion: With inelastic demand, at the margin, a price increase of some percentage will cause a smaller percentage decrease in quantity demanded, and thus a rise in revenue. As less is needed to be produced, cost will also decline. 11.0.16 Choose TWO. Partial credit will NOT be awarded for this question. In the graph above, the price of X has decreased, yielding the ‘new budget constraint.’ The income effect of this price change (on X) is the movement between points (choose TWO): 0 \\(X^{\\ast}\\) \\(X_B\\) \\(X^{\\ast\\ast}\\) \\(Y^{\\ast}\\) \\(X_B\\) and \\(X^{\\ast\\ast}\\) Discussion: This is straight out of the web book and textbook. PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS AND COSTS 11.0.17 Suppose MPL = 20 and MPK = 40 and the rental rate on capital is £10. If the level of production is currently efficient (and both capital and labour are used, with an everywhere-diminishing MRTS), the wage rate must be £10 £5 £20 £40 b: 5 pounds. The MRTS must equal the price ratio. Thus \\(MPL/MPK=w/r\\) so here \\(20/40=5/10\\) 11.0.18 (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) Suppose the production function for good q is given by \\(q(K,L) = 3K + 2L\\) where K and L are capital and labour inputs. Which of the following statements are true? Consider three statements about this function: The function exhibits constant returns to scale. The function exhibits increasing returns to scale. The function exhibits diminishing marginal productivity for each input (holding the other input constant). The function exhibits constant marginal productivities for each input (holding the other input constant). A positive amount of both inputs are required to produce a positive output. The function exhibits constant returns to scale (doubling K and L doubles outputs, for example *and* The function exhibits constant marginal productivities for each input: output increases at rate 2 per labour input and at rate 3 per capital input 11.0.19 (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) Which of the following statements are correct, regarding a firm’s cost curve? Total costs are the sum of fixed and variable costs Economists include consumer surplus in their definition of revenues. If Average Cost (AC) increases in quantity, the Average Cost (AC) curve must be above the Marginal Cost (MC) curve for each level of output. The MC curve intersects the AC curve at its maximum (if a maximum exists). If marginal costs are increasing and there are no fixed costs, this implies increasing AC everywhere. TRUE: Total costs are the sum of fixed and variable cost If marginal costs are increasing and there are no fixed costs, this implies increasing AC everywhere. The others are false. Consumer surplus is not a part of revenue, it’s an entirely different thing. If Average Cost (AC) increases in quantity, the Average Cost (AC) curve must be BELOW the Marginal Cost (MC) curve for each level of output. The MC curve intersects the AC curve at its MINIMUM (if a MINIMUM exists). ... AC could be everywhere above MC if there is a fixed cost. Profit maximisation and supply, Perfect competition, general equilibrium and efficiency 11.0.20 (Choose ONE.) Suppose the market demand curve for a good follows \\(Q_D = 100 - P\\) and the market supply follows \\(Q_S = -10 + P\\). What is the total revenue of firms (expenditure of consumers) on this product, in equilibrium? -45 -1000 -2475 -3025 None of the above. 100-P = P-10 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 2p = 110 \\(\\rightarrow\\) P=55 \\(\\rightarrow\\) Q = 100-55=55-10=45. Revenue = Q*P = 45*55 =2475 11.0.21 (Choose ONE.) Under perfect competition, if an industry is characterized by positive economic profits in the short run firms will leave the market in the long run and the short-run supply curve will shift outward. firms will enter the market in the long run and the short-run supply curve will shift outward. firms will enter the market in the long run and the short-run supply curve will shift inward. firms will leave the market in the long run and the short-run supply curve will shift inward. b: firms will enter the market in the long run and the short-run supply curve will shift outward. 11.0.22 (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) Markets can fail to achieve efficiency for the following reason(s) There are prices consumers do not think are fair. There are wages workers do not think are fair. Trade puts people out of work. There are barriers to entry, leading to monopolies. There are too many consumers. e. There are barriers to entry, leading to monopolies. PUBLIC GOODS 11.0.23 (Choose all that are correct, and no more.) Which of the following are most reasonably considered public goods? Clothing A giant wedge of cheese Headache medicines provided to individuals for free by the NHS Useful and interesting knowledge generated from an archeological discovery An earthquake-prevention system that successfully prevents earthquakes from occuring Correct: Useful and interesting knowledge generated from an archeological discovery Correct: An earthquake-prevention system that successfully prevents earthquakes from occuring Both of these are reasonably considered nonrival and nonexcludable, ergo Public Goods. END OF PAPER One might argue that this involves some level of aggregation, as the household may consist of multiple individuals. However, conventionally household-level data is considered micro-data, perhaps because: 1. We typically (but not always) consider the household as a decision-making agent, the ‘unitary household model) 2. This is not ’very aggregated’ and still has many many independent units. We typically consider it microdata unless it is aggregated, e.g., at the level of a region or country.↩ So you could solve this for the optimal ‘whole number’ of leeks and chocolates… students get credit for this on an exam, but it’s not necessary.↩ "]
