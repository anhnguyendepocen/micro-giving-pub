This draws heavily from several texts and other resources, including: Introduction to Economic Analysis version 2.1 by McAfee, Lewis, and Dale – available for free LINKED HERE under a Creative Commons license. Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50… older editions are fine too, but beware of some changes) A free alternative, at a similar level: Microeconomics an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine Microeconomics by Hugh Gravelle and Ray Rees (version 3, widely available online for free) A somewhat more advanced-intermediate-level text which I think you will find very useful; this is not yet officially Open-Source, but you can find it online for free (and the authors are OK with this, I have emailed them). Just do a web search for ‘Gravelle and Rees Microeconomics’ and you will find the pdf From time to time I will refer you (and draw from) another open source work that has very clear explanations: Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus by Yoram Baumann, the self-proclaimed ‘World’s First Standup Economist’ More rigorous, advanced and applied work will draw from David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here)[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/] this will give you a flavor of the PhD level micro David Autor. 14.03 Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy.

Academic articles and working papers as well as some of my own writings… these are mentioned below *A more detailed description of the texts is given in the next section, here 1.3 This ‘handout’/ web-book/ online resource Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics I wrote these notes to outline all of the material you are responsible for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short amount of time we have during lecture. I don’t mean you’re simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that these notes will aim to refer to everything that you are responsible for. These notes are meant to be a complement to the textbooks and readings (and to the lectures, tutorials/problem sets and other material on the ELE) and to tie all of this together. I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in these notes. However, each year the module adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to these notes as we go along. I will try to keep you informed of any changes via the VLE forums. Notes versus slides?: These notes should include all of the slide material plus explanatory notes and enrichment material. (However, I left out some of the jokes.) I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will also make the slides themselves available after just before the lectures, even though they are redundant– these notes have everything. Some ‘markers’ and abbreviations: ‘McDL’ refers to the McAfee, Dale and Lewis text ‘NS’ refers to the Nicholson and Snyder text (usually chapters/numbering from the 12th edition is referenced; if you’re using an earlier edition, make sure the content corresponds) GR refers to Gravelle and Rees’ Microeconomics text (free online, more or less) ‘DA’ refers to David Autor’s MIT open courseware notes for Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy ‘QMC’ refers to ‘Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus’ (Baumann) Text in blue usually refers to questions you should try to answer on your own (and I sometimes provide suggested answers in the footnotes. Try to answer it yourself first.) Some text is given in gray to indicate that this is a side point or a discussion. (I’m moving most of this to footnotes.) ‘Comprehension Q:’ A question you should be able to answer if you are following along. ‘T numbers’ (take these loosely please) refer to the weeks of term in which I intended to cover specific material. For example ‘T1:03 - T1:04a’ means ‘term 2 week three (both lectures) and term 2 week 4, first lecture only’ 1.3.1 Tech details of this book (‘do I call this ’collophon’?) I created this in Rmd (the ‘R languages’ ‘markdown’), including some latex and html code too. This is all put together by Knitr and Bookdown using the ‘Pandoc’ conversion tool into an Html file which I’m hosting via Github pages for now. I’ll occasionally use/show some R code; you should consider getting proficient in R and developing other ‘data-sciencey’ tech skills (things like R, Python, Stata, git, vim, shell scripts…) Let me know if you want to look ‘under the hood’. 1.4 Outline and description of module Planned syllabus, coverage: The planned module outline is below; as noted, timings may need to be adjusted, and so material may cut for time constraints.

You also may want to get involved in research (doing it, using it) yourself; let me know if you want to chat about this. If you are thinking of going on to postgraduate study, or are interested in a job involving research, I would strongly advise you to do a final-year undergraduate dissertation. We now have an Economics-specific module for this. You can see some of my research on my webpage and some of my impact projects at the links above 2.3 This module bee2038: Intermediate Microeconomics (applied) Lectures Problem sets: There are eight problem sets, each covering a specific block of material. The material in these problem sets either comes from exams or builds exam skills. These will be posted BELOW. Representative answers for each problem set will be given a few days after each problem set is released, or shortly before the relevant support class. Classes (AKA ‘tutorials’ AKA ‘seminars’) every fortnight (5 total) Support classes will largely focus on covering (exploring, solving, discussing) the problem sets. However, there will obviously not be time to cover every question in the tutorial. Note there are only 5 tutorials but 8 problem sets; thus, tutorials may cover problems from multiple recent problem sets. These classes are about applying material you have learned, not lecturing on it or learning it for the first time. Come ready to ask questions and participate: The classes are a smaller group setting than the lectures; we aim to make these highly interactive and participatory. To really be helpful, we need to know what areas you might be struggling with and where your logic might be breaking down; thus we will either do cold calling or highly encourage all the students in these tutorials to ask and answer questions. Think of these as (especially) ‘safe spaces’; you will be judged or marked based on your performance in the support classes, and there are no dumb questions. If you have a question many of your peers probably have the same question, so asking it provides a public good. First ‘midterm’ examination, 90 minutes, fully MCQ (but may require ‘choose all that are correct’); 15 marks (30% of term mark) Final examination, 120 minutes, MCQ, solved problems, short essays: 35 marks (70% of term mark) Important: Final exam open response (essays/short answer) questions test your deep understanding and ability to explain concepts. I will help you prepare for this, and give you examples. Five essential competencies (for economics students) Apply the scientific process to economic phenomena Analyse and evaluate behaviors and outcomes using economic concepts and models Use quantitative approaches in Economics Think critically about economic methods and their applications Communicate economic ideas in diverse collaborations paraphrased from Algood and Bayer, 2017 American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings, “Learning outcomes for economists”. This module particularly emphasizes 5, and also 2 and 4. These skills are also highly relevant to employers updated link: Texts and resources Recommended text: ‘Intermediate Microeconomics and Its Application’ (12th ed.) Should be available at the University bookstore for around £50, with access to online materials Other recent editions are also OK, but be careful as numbering can change Many other resources online (see below) Note that there are a variety of sources and online courses — any intermediate or advanced textbook in Microeconomics will cover virtually the same material. There are now texts available for free, legally, online, such as Microeconomics Markets, Methods &amp; Models; an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine: A full-fledged text covering many of the topics of this module, without calculus Intermediate microeconomics - M Walbert Illinois tutorials - click ‘tutorials’: A series of tutorials for an intermediate microeconomics module. Covers many of the topics of this module. No calculus but a lot of algebra. Lots of supplementary materials too. Quantum Microeconomics; consider the version either with or without calculus: An unconventional but very careful and interesting approach; my impression is that it is well organised and explained Principles of Economics 2e, Openstax by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine - very well organised, not quite ‘intermediate’, not enough maths for my taste, but may be very helpful as revision and as an additional source of explanations! “Introduction to Economic Analysis”, by Preston McAfee, Caltech and Tracy Lewis, Duke University (note this text uses calculus). Introduction to Economic Analysis - MacAffee, Lewis, Dale: A ‘no-fluff’ text from an esteemed source. Covers much of this module, but a bit at the more advanced side (actually the level varies greatly throughout). Includes calculus and lots of parametric examples. Lots of solved problems. Some resources on CORE , mentioned above, may be helpful, but that needs further investigation, as it is aimed at year-one Economics. I also recommend Simple economics on the web, which contains a great number of useful interactive graphical and algebraic exercises. Play around with this, they are super-helpful and intuitive. Thanks Frank.) Issues with Nicholson and Snyder text and associated online materials: Students can contact Roxanne Watts for access to any online resources associated with the text, roxanne.watts@cengage.com (tel) 01264347322. Expect response to simple questions in 24 hours (1 business day) Note: The module moves through select parts of this textbook; coverage and order given in this ‘handout’, as well as references to coverage in other texts. Lectures \\(\\neq\\) everything!: Some of the material is only mentioned in lecture/handout, but you still must read &amp; learn it (I will be clear on this). On the other hand some sections of the NS text are skipped. Some material is covered in these handouts, or recommended readings, that is not in the text; this is clearly emphasized. All of this is laid out in this handout. 2.4 Problem sets Note: There will be approximately 8 total problem sets, each covering a block of material. As noted above, these are aimed to help prepare you for the assessments. These will be posted BELOW Representative answers and explanations for each problem set will given about 1-week after posting. The five support classes (tutorials) will cover parts of these. 2.5 Feedback on your highly-esteemed but extremely humble lecturer We will have two ‘official’ feedback points. There will be an ‘early feedback’ survey, perhaps around week 4 or 5. This gives you a chance to give me constructive suggestions that I can adapt to during the rest of the module. For the Accelerate end-of-module feedback, you will be asked to rate me. All of these questions are seen as an evaluation of my performance specifically by the “associate dean”. You will be asked to express an opinion, from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’, on one or more questions about the quality of this module. In particular: Overall I am satisfied with the quality of the module. If at any time you think you don’t agree with any of these, please let me know how I can make it better You can tell me directly, or anonymously at: I am not particularly a fan of the “customer service” model of education. It leads lecturers to water-down the content and hinders us from presenting challenging and engaging material. and limit your educational experience. In fact, there is in fairly compelling research that suggests that these measures are not reliable and are “poorly correlated with student learning”. 2.5.1 Responding to feedback I listen carefully to your responses and continually adjust the material and the approach. To give you the best education, I try to follow a process of Kaizen, or continual improvement. I also make changes from year-to-year, in response to your feedback. Some changes made responding to the previous year’s feedback: Before 2019-20 the module was called “BEE2024 Economic Principles and policy”, and it was divided into a Microeconomics term and a Macroeconomics term.\" To make things simpler, we have renamed this Microeconomics part “BEE2038: Intermediate Microeconomics”, and we no longer share the ELE page. However the coverage is the same as before (allowing for normal year-to-year adjustments). Reduced coverage, enabling better focus. In particular, I have eliminated or consolidated much of the material on the firm’s production function and costs. In earlier surveys, this was the topic students liked the least. In 2019 I am removing the coverage of the history of supply and demand curves and a few other topics. Better integration of the problem sets and tutorials with the lectures and the assessments. Better coordination across tutorial sessions. In 2019 I will be providing more practice multiple-choice questions closely emulating the style of MCQ’s that will be on the midterm and final exam Materials: Greater motivation for each lecture. Less content in the slides themselves (less busy). A more complete narrative in the handout files, making these more readable Opportunity to feedback/discuss the handout and problem sets directly on these files (through Dropbox comments) Lectures, tutorials and notes will have a greater focus on carefully explaining the important concepts that many students struggled with (e.g., Expected Utility) I will try to provide more revision coverage and supplementary materials for managerial economics students. 2.6 The story of this module Note: You will have seen many of these concepts before. But do you really understand them well enough to explain them to a non-economist and to apply them to a new real-world situation? And do you understand the limits and critiques of these, and how economists try to measure and test them? Asessment hint: I try to ask you questions that you would not know the answer to had you not taken this module. What would be the purpose of you simply learning ‘common sense’ or ‘conventional wisdom’ … that you already knew? If you are answering an open response/essay question by simply stating something that the average Joe sitting on a pub bench would have said, you may want to rethink the way you are answering this question. I am not designing the exams to trip you up… just to check that you have learned something. *For details on the coverage in each part, and references to coverage in texts other than NS, see the relevant section below, or the outline above 2.6.1 1. Economic basics (weeks 1-2 approx) In weeks one and two we will go over some of the simple tools in the economists’ kit. I will try to explain to you what we mean by ‘economic models’ and give you some examples of these which may be familiar to you. I will not go over the math tools in the lecture; you should study/revise this on your own. We will go over many of these again briefly as we apply these math tools to our economic models throughout the module. We will also start thinking about, and formalisng individual decisions—over nearly all spheres of life— in a way you may not have seen before, which may even strike you as weirdly hyper-rational. Essentially, this (sometimes confusingly called ‘normative decision theory’) is the way economists typically conceive of and model people’s choices. Even though it seems to require precise optimization, perhaps to a strange extent, there are various reasonable justifications for this, and you might also see it as a benchmark… ‘Let’s understand what optimization would look like, as a starting point’. This framework is actually fairly general; it can allow all sorts of preferences (e.g., embodying ‘risk aversion’ and ‘altruism’) and wide-ranging choices. However it does imply certain ‘restrictions’: it rules out some sort of behavior that is perhaps obviously illogical. We will discuss how ‘preferences’ may define the ‘utility functions’. The ‘uility function’ is the thing that make choices in order to maximize. In the classical framework, people make choices in order to maximise the value of their utility function. Utility functions can also be expressed in terms of ‘indifference curves’ (but keep the distinction in mind; the indifference curves are not themselves the utility functions). Under this framework individuals make the ‘optimal choices’ … by making the choices that yield the maximum value of the utility functions given their constraints … in particular they have a ‘budget constraint’ that says they cannot spend more than they earn. You will learn how to derive these budget constraints and plot these on a graph, along with the indifference curves, and to interpret these diagrams. I will also introduce ‘data’ and some key concepts from ‘Empirical analysis’ and ‘Econometrics’ here 2.6.2 2. Building the model, putting it together, examining it (weeks 3-5 approx) ‘What determines the price and quantities exchanged in an unregulated (or ’free’) market?’ ‘Do markets yield good outcomes?’ These questions have been at the backbone of Economics for millennia, at least since Aristotle. Classical economists such as Adam Smith built-up ideas of how seemingly random and disorganized markets can yield predictable and efficient outcomes, at least under appropriate conditions. Neoclassical and modern economists (such as Alfred Marshall, David Ricardo, Leon Walras, and Paul Samuelson) have formalized these, building models involving of systems of demand and supply and general equilibrium, and have made the case for the efficiency and desirability of the free market outcomes, at least under specified conditions.1 In the second (and largest) chunk of the course, we will learn some of the essential building blocks of this model, and how they are justified and put together to yield predictions for market outcomes and ‘welfare’. In the process, we will get useful ideas and intuitions about the working of markets. We will learn how individual optimization implies a relationship between the price of a good (and the consumer’s income) and the amount a consumer chooses to purchase of that good; her individual demand curve. Adding up these individual demand curves yields the market demand curve, which describes the way the total amount of a good consumers wish to purchase depends on the market price of that good. Note: This is covered NS ch. 6-7, but reading these sections is optional. You are only responsible for the brief ‘sketch’ of this that I provide in this handout and in a short lecture, and any problem sets related to this. Someone has to make this stuff, you know! We consider ‘production functions’ that map how inputs can be turned into outputs. If firms are seeking to maximize profits, then whatever output they want to produce … they will try to produce it using the combination of inputs (Capital, labor, etc.) that can do this at the lowest cost. If we know production functions and input costs, we can describe a firm’s cost of producing every amount of a particular good. Economists typically assume that firms make choices to maximize profits. (Mathematically, this ‘optimisation’, i.e., maximisation, has some things in common with the consumer optimisation of utility, so it may look familiar). Knowing their cost of production and the demand curve they will face, firms will thus choose to produce the amount that yields them the highest profit; we will explain the conditions for this. With ‘free entry/exit of firms’ we have the (ideal) situation of perfect competition. Each firm’s supply curve is added up to generate the market supply curve; we consider this in both the ‘short and long run’. We define the concepts of ‘consumer surplus’ and ‘producer surplus’; adding these yields the total value in an economy or the total ‘social welfare’. We will briefly and roughly consider the idea of an equilibrium in all markets; prices such that quantity demanded equals quantity supplied for all outputs and inputs. We will get some sense of the idea of what general ‘economic efficiency’ means. I will state and give you some intuition behind the ‘first and second welfare theorems’; the conditions under which free markets yield ‘good outcomes’, defined in a particular sense. 2.6.3 3. How the market can go wrong (and how to maybe fix it) (weeks 6-7 approx) Notice I kept saying “under certain conditions” free markets yield good outcomes. These conditions may not hold, for various reasons. In the third chunk, we discuss two of these reasons, which lead to ‘market failures’. It is important to understand these. These (sometimes) offer a justification for government intervention, and help us understand how government can best respond. These also offer insights for business models; which ‘goods’ may be hard to provide without government subsidies, and how can we use technological innovation to capture value and reduce the extent of market failures? (Businesses may also be able to take advantage of market failures in ways that are harmful to public welfare, But I would hate to think I’m training you to do this.) Not all goods can easily be restricted to a single consumer. ‘Non-rival’ and ‘non-excludable’ goods (e.g., a fireworks display) are called public goods: these will tend to be undersupplied by the free market, as we will come to understand. We will also discuss the evidence for the private provision of these, and consider government’s ability to provide them. This is the polar opposite market structure to perfect competition; a monopoly is a single firm that exclusively dominated a particular industry. It will tend to produce less and charge more than would be socially optimal, yielding a ‘deadweight loss’ (aka ‘DWL’). ‘Price discrimination’ is (more or less) when a firm charges different prices to different consumers; this can reduce (or increase) the ‘deadweight loss’ of monopoly, as we will learn. 2.6.4 4. Extensions to the model and applications (weeks 8-11 approx) In the final chunk we extend the model to accommodate some important aspects of the real world. We investigate the implication of these for market outcomes. We make many decisions without knowing exactly what the consequence of each choice will be. Economists typically model this using the “expected utility” framework. A warning: students often get this concept wrong, so be careful. Expected utility is not the same as ‘expected monetary value’; and this allows EU to embody risk aversion. For many decisions we make the consequences depend on what others do; we have ‘strategic interaction’. Economist usually consider this using the framework and tools of game theory. People may not actually make decisions In the hyper-rational way we have been assuming. Here we carefully consider the adaptation of some insights from Psychology to Economics, yielding ‘behavioral economics’ 2.7 The big (small) question What’s gonna be on the exam?? As noted, you are responsible for all material outlined in this handout … the syllabus + assigned readings + materials covered in lecture and tutorials. E.g., the exams may cover material only briefly mentioned in lecture, and will expect knowledge from prerequisites I try to reward broad understanding, rather than merely the ability to memorize a few formulae and definitions. So try to really know this stuff and be able to discuss it and apply it, both to algebraic/numerical examples and to real-world issues. I give you copious examples of what will be on the examinations, including practice problems at the end of each lecture, problem sets, lots of mock and sample question on the VLE, and previous examinations and midterms. You need to work hard; here is the guideline specified… Guided Independent Study per half: 143 hours to be divided between background reading (e.g. 40 hrs), solving/reviewing problem sets (e.g. 40 hrs) and exam revision (e.g. 43 hrs) And now, a pep talk. 2.7.1 The real big question: why are you here? To learn. Because you think it’s interesting to ponder big questions about individuals, markets, and society to understand how people have tried to bring order to difficult questions because you want to contribute something to the world (see above) Because this stuff is actually useful in the real world For your professional career For your life If you want to go into academia (in Economics or otherwise) Some people and organisations seem to value this information: 2017 Government Economic Fast Stream Scheme Don’t waste this experience fretting about marks. Try to actually learn and not just mimic the process, as in ‘cargo cults.’ See Richard Feynman, on cargo cult science: So, why are you here? Perhaps not to hear what the lecturer has to say, but for the lecturer to respond to what you say We live in a world post-printing press and with lots of digital media. To be honest, there are some things about lecturing that are obsolete in my opinion. Anyone can hear great lectures online or read extremely informative textbooks. However, as a student at this Russell group University… You can interact with me, ask me questions, come up with ideas, work with other students. Impress me and get a good letter of reference. I advise everyone to come to my office hours at least once. 2.8 Resources I highly advise you to use the forum to ask and answer questions and make suggestions and comments. Students typically find this forum very useful. VLE link Ask questions and make comments on the forum LINK, I will monitor it Or on these notes themselves using hypothes.is Or, for anonymity, just complain on social media and I’ll probably see it. Email For specific questions comments about your degree scheme and requirements, is best to contact the Building One ‘help desk’, or the appropriate help desk for your degree. If you have a question about course material or coverage which other students will be interested in, please post this on the forum. If you email me I may respond by asking you to post this on the form. If you have a specific question that needs private attention then email me and I will try to respond. However, if it is a longer question I may ask you to come to my office hours or schedule a time to meet. Stay tuned for the ‘announcements’ Also, there is a bunch of other material on the VLE. Remember to do practice questions and formative assessments! 2.8.1 In-lecture interaction Even though our lecture time is scarce, It seems to me that to get value out of this antiquated format known as a lecture, we should have at least some interaction. Otherwise, you may as well be watching a video. Some things we may work with include: Responseware, questions, polls and ‘chat’; ‘Kahoot’ In-lecture experiments and games Remember to install Responseware on your smart phones, or get a free turningpoint clicker! Download it on app stores, or use it on a laptop the session id is ‘david’ (check) browser mode: To get the most out of the lectures, I advise you to Ask me questions, especially at beginning and end, raise both hands if you are lost Draw-along and solve-along with the slides and board work. The act of trying to construct models, solve algebra, and draw and interpret diagrams yourself really helps you understand them better and use them 2.9 How to do well Put in the work Read the handout and the relevant parts of the text (as outlined in this handout) in advance of the lecture, come with questions Handouts and lectures mainly follow the text Do the problem set questions, suggested questions and class questions, understand the answers Do the many practice problems and mock exam questions Care about the content Care about actually understanding this stuff. This will be rewarded. Don’t try to game this. It’s easier to just learn this stuff. Try to achieve Real Understanding: Be able to explain this stuff in your own words (in writing) and apply it to new situations Interact and discuss: Peers, Forum, office hours Be careful you know how to interpret the exam instructions correctly, and use your time wisely Skills to hone and build. Your success in this module will depend in large part on building and applying basic maths skills and tools (mainly at the GCSE level), and strong reading/writing/logic abilities. You should build the ability to comprehend and respond carefully and logically to nuanced questions (essay/short answer, solved problem, and multiple choice). These problem will incorporate quantitative reasoning, logic, and the ability to understand and clearly express ideas, to correctly characterise and describe theories and evidence, and to apply learned principles to new situations. تحذير, 警报, การเตือ, चेतावनीน: This last comment is especially relevant for non-native speakers of English. Students in past years often worried a great deal but got very good marks, and showed good understanding 2.10 Fortune Cookie Wisdom Here are some broad Lessons that I hope you take away from this module, And that will help you throughout… I will come back to these. It may seem like we have the answers, but this is only where we have asked the questions very carefully But sometimes ignorance is bliss. Examples: Sunk-cost fallacy, gains to trade/comparative advantage, opportunity cost, free-riding/prisoners’ dilemma, double-marginalization,‘raise price to raise profit’, etc. I’ve had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife. Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out. We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a ‘single representative consumer’. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights. However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or testing these models, be careful; people may differ and they may change and they may have multiple motives. Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets \\(\\rightarrow\\) opportunities. I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse. I’m not telling you what you need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics. As I also mentioned, these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks. Here are some possible examples. Imperfection: Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘All you can eat’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for ‘all-you-can-eat’ And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later. Free-riding on public goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) Disneyworld, resorts We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride. They then charge an admission fee to ‘be inside of Disney World’ and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods.2 Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Uber, AirBnb Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves). Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Tinder Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high. A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit. If you’re interested, see my research on this here, presentation slides here, my research page is here. Asymmetric information, adverse selection \\(\\rightarrow\\) NHS, ‘Obamacare’ This one is a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA. Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later). There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance ( or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well. Adv: Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you ‘outsource’ And when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do? Much of this work has tried to specify more and more general conditions for this, requiring less and less stringent assumptions.↩︎ For a different approach see ‘radical xchange’ (sp?), Blockchain and Robert Wiblin 80000 hours podcast episode 63,interview with Vitalik Buterin.↩︎ "],
["models.html", "3 Economic Models (L1-2) 3.1 What is Economics? 3.2 Why learn these models? 3.3 Economic Models 3.4 Applications 3.5 Basic Supply-Demand Model 3.6 How Economists ‘Verify’ (or Assess) Theoretical Models 3.7 Positive and normative Review questions and problems from NS Chapter 1", " 3 Economic Models (L1-2) – Content largely aligns with Nicholson/Snyder Chapter 1: Economic Models – It also aligns with much of chapters 1-2 of the free text by Curtis and Irvine 3.1 What is Economics? Note: DR: It has changed. There are different views. Ask two economists, and you’ll probably get at least three answers. “Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.” “Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” Alfred Marshall Note: The first quote suggests an approach (how we do our research), the second suggests a domain (what we focus on). Note: “Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.” Ludwig von Mises 3.1.1 What is Microeconomics? The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets. Largely, using theoretical and mathematical ‘models’ that depend on strong assumptions. Comprehension Q: Consider some examples of ‘relevant choices’ for economic study. Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications. A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and ‘general’; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications. 3.2 Why learn these models? Consider the parable of the tortoise and the hare (Aesop)… Figure 3.1: Hopelessly unrealistic and useless? One might question the realism of this story: Can hares really speak? Is this a rabbit or a hare? What other animals were racing? Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above questions? The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models. Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop’s fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of ‘Ceteris paribus’ (all other things being equal) can help us here. What do models give us? There are different views of this Via logic and mathematics: Assumptions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Results and sometimes these also yield testable predictions (if the assumptions hold) Adv: When considering and evaluating these models, you can critique only the assumptions; the results are logically/mathematically proven although when the results contradict real-world evidence this hints that the assumptions may be substantially wrong. Do these simplified models yield conclusions that are relevant to the more complicated real world? Maybe, and sometimes. We will consider the evidence. So why learn these models? A starting point (Sometimes) make concrete predictions you can test Building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking Discussion is framed around them and they are seen as a ‘baseline’ Understand the arguments and models to be able to effectively critique or extend them Some critics of what they call ‘neoliberal economics’ can be misinformed about what it is. Their criticism can sound to us mainstream economists like someone who says ‘cars are dangerous and should be banned because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping’ 3.3 Economic Models Economic model: Simple theoretical description that captures the essentials of how the economy works.3 3.3.1 The PPF: a ‘model’ and a way of seeing things NS ‘A few basic principles’ CM 1.4-1.5 The “production possibility frontier” (PPF) illustrates all the combinations of two (or more) goods that can be produced … by a firm, a family, an economy, globally, etc. Each point is a combination of the amount of the ‘x-axis’ and ‘y-axis’ good. All points on or below the curve are achievable; all points above cannot be produced. Figure 3.2: source: tutor2u Figure 3.2: source: tutor2u Figure 3.2: source: tutor2u Above, we see a depiction of the PPF, the concept of diminishing marginal return, and the concept of inefficiency (from tutor2u.)4 You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced. I’m not sure if I would call it a ‘model’, but it certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions. This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now. Note: For comprehension: Draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means. See fig 1.1 Advanced: Consider … what assumptions does the PPF (implicitly) make? PPF illustrates key principles Principle 1: Scarce Resources Principle 2: Scarcity involves opportunity cost.5 Notes: ‘’The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it.’’(NS, 2011) ‘Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative forgone in making any choice.’ PRUM, chapter 1, section ‘Opportunity Cost’ The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone ‘next best’ opportunity from a choice. I may just call this ‘cost’ Comprehension question (advanced): Think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the ‘cost’ and the economists’ definition of an ‘opportunity cost’ On the PPF the opportunity cost of more clothing is less food. Principle 3: Opportunity costs are (often) increasing. What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases. To produce more and more clothing you would have to give up increasing amounts of food. The “law” of diminishing marginal returns. I’m somewhat sceptical of this being a ‘law’; there are certainly increasing returns in certain regions. However, you will see it again and again as it is a fairly standard assumption. You should read and consider these applications on your own. They will show how the economic principles and theory can be applied to the real-world and test and improve your understanding of the theory. 3.4 Applications 3.4.1 Application 1.1: Economics in the Natural world (NS) The NS textbook presents many interesting applications. These offer you the opportunity to test your knowledge and understanding and apply it to real-world situations. These can also be helpful on assessments; applications may come up, and it may be useful to refer to these and supporting your points on free answer questions. Studies of honeybees have found that they generally do not gather all of the nectar in a particular flower before moving on. (NS) Why not? Adv: What key features do modern human economies have that ‘animal economies’ don’t have? Largely: trade, prices, specialisation, free choice vs instinct. The economics of trade may also apply to the natural world in certain ways. Adv: Above, we see the working of ant-aphid symbiosis, a form of mutualism. Relevant to the ‘conditions necessary for trade to occur’? The ants ‘farm’ the aphids, who secrete nice substances. In return the ants protect the aphids and only sometimes eat them. 3.4.2 Is university worth the time and money The NS text has an application “Is It Worth Your Time to Be Here?” This is a contentious issue, especially in the USA, where private university tuitions run at over £40,000 per year (for a four-year course!) There is constant popular discussion of this. See, e.g., … Please stop asking whether college is worth it Is your university degree barely worth the paper it’s written on? Discuss The case against education, Bryan Caplan; LSE review Consider: Social vs private returns. Is there a case for ‘market failure’? NS Application 1.3: Rise and Fall of Blockbuster link Critical contemporary business challenge: (Note NS edition 12 is updated and discusses Netflix, etc) Blockbuster and Netflix are selling what we call information goods. These have a zero marginal (distribution) cost. They are competing with online merchants. This is characteristic of many things ‘online’ In a turnabout in policy, Blockbuster agreed to give the studios a substantial share (as much as 40 percent) of the revenues from its movie rentals in exchange for price reductions of up to 90 percent. (NS, application 1.3) (Why) was this a good business move? Was it efficient from a social point of view? 3.5 Basic Supply-Demand Model …Describes how a good’s price and the quantity exchanged are determined Determined by the preferences, behaviour, and costs of potential buyers and sellers Note: in 2019 we will not be covering the historical background to the Marshallian cross (the demand and supply you may be familiar with). However, I do expect you to understand this model itself. 3.5.1 Marshall’s Model of Supply and Demand Economists and philosophers have long sought to explain ‘what determines the prices, and why do they change the way they do?’ In the 19th century UK prices were falling while quantities were increasing; this was a puzzle. Alfred Marshall argued that a good’s price must equal both the cost to produce and the value (to consumers) of the last unit produced and consumed. He introduced the ‘demand curve’; with a downward slope. This slope was justified by ‘satiation’: for an individual, additional units of a good are usually valued less and less. For example, you might be willing to pay thousands of pounds to be able to access 100 gallons of water rather than no water at all, but if you already have access to a thousand gallons of water, you will not be willing to pay very much for an additional 100 gallons. Furthermore, firms must cater to less and less keen consumers as they wants to sell more and more units. We come back to this later in the module. ‘Willingness to pay’ (wtp) becomes less and less for the next unit purchased, so will buy more only at a lower price. Equivalently, at a lower price more people find the value exceeds the price, and for additional units. Note that we will also return to these questions in more depth in later chapters as we build up the demand and supply curves. Imagine ‘quantity supplied as a function of price’: \\(Q^s(p)\\) and ‘quantity supplied as a function of price’: \\(Q^d(p)\\). With ‘single crossing’ (a fancy condition you can ignore in this module) there is a unique price where \\(Q^s(p)=Q^d(p)\\), and a unique quantity where the value of the “last unit purchased” … the lowest value any consumer puts on any unit he/she buys … equals its cost to produce, … and this will be the prevailing price. (These ideas will be further elaborated in later lectures.) Cost and value example Imagine one consumer and one producer. Units 1-5 of some product (say, hats) have a value to each consumer (of that unit, add up to get total value of units purchased) stated below, in terms of the ‘other good’, say food. (You can imagine food costs one per unit.) The consumer is willing to give up 5 units of food to gain 1 hat, 4 more units of food to gain the second hat, et. Hats 1-5 have a production cost stated below (in the same units). The producer is can make the first hat at cost 1, the second hat at cost 2, etc. Unit X Value to consumer Cost to produce 1 5 0.5 2 4 1 3 2 2 4 1 3 5 0 4 At each potential price, how many units is the consumer willing to buy? At each potential price, how many units is the producer willing to make/sell? This will imply an individual ‘demand curve’ and ‘supply curve’ for the consumer and producer – can you draw it? What price is ‘equilibrium’, i.e., at what price will the consumer and producer be willing to buy/sell the same amount?6 At this price (2), notice that the value the consumer places on the ‘last unit’ purchased (the third unit, one yielding the lowest value that he still buys) is equal to the cost of producing this unit, 2 in each case. This is not a coincidence. It also hints at the efficiency of the equilibrium price. If, at some price the amount a consumer valued an additional unit was less than the cost of production, and that unit were not produced, then we could make both parties, so such an outcome would not be efficient! If, at some price the amount a consumer valued the last unit was greater so such an outcome would not be efficient either Only where these are equal do we have an efficient level of production/consumption. We will return to this later. Scissors analogy The equilibrium model is analogised to a pair of scissors; neither scis cuts alone So don’t ask ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged’? Understand why ‘Just like neither scis cuts alone, neither the supply nor the demand curve determines the equilibrium price and quantity in isolation’? Adv: Consider: What does it mean to be at equilibrium, and how do we get there? Draw: the famous Marshallian cross Can you explain? The inefficiency of any price other than where \\(Q^D(p)=Q^S(p)\\)? If the price was set at a different value, what forces might push it to the equilibrium? Suggested ans: To economists, a ‘shortage’ is where, at the prevailing or imposed price, consumers are willing to buy more than is available. Some consumers get value from the good in excess of the price. In such a case, firms might offer a higher price, or sellers might ask for a higher price. The price rise would reduce quantity demanded (not ‘reduce demand’) and increase quantity supplied (not ‘reduce supply’). Harder question: Who gains or suffers with a government-imposed price floor/ceiling? To respect yourself in the morning, you must know (as discussed in the NS textbook) Which factors cause the supply and demand curves to shift? What causes ‘movements along’ the supply or demand curve? Note: Caveat, to avoid later confusion: These models assume ‘price-taking’; neither buyers nor sellers consider the impact of their choices on prices Do US, EU, and Japanese farm subsidies help or hurt Africans in net? This is discussed in NS application 1.4 (Economics According to Bono) as well as in an academic article ‘The Impact of Agricultural Subsidies on Global Welfare’: Developing countries strongly oppose domestic and export subsidies by developed countries. Since developing countries cannot afford to support their producers at the levels of developed countries, subsidies tend to limit fair competition. In general, both domestic and export subsidies distort production patterns. Some argue that subsidies given to produc- ers in developed countries have resulted in overproduction and lower world prices of agricultural goods, which have been harmful to agriculture in developing countries. Others have argued that although subsidies distort trade flows, they have been beneficial for consumers in both exporting and importing countries, resulting in a net increase in global welfare, especially in developing importing countries (Bhagwati 2004). This is mainly because subsidies lower world prices for agricultural goods (Koo and Kennedy, 2006)7 This will be skipped in lecture, but please read it; it may come up on an exam. Think about: what do we mean ‘in net’? No obvious theoretical or empirical answers Microeconomic theory helps us consider it, and look for answers Should hurt African farmers Should help African consumers … Which effect dominates (change in African profit less change in African consumer surplus)? … Note: Fig. 1 in NS text depicts African supply/demand mapped against world price 3.6 How Economists ‘Verify’ (or Assess) Theoretical Models This will be skipped in lecture, but we will come back to some of these ideas later. Two methods: Testing Assumptions ‘Verifying’ economic models by examining validity of assumptions upon which models are based. Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.? Notes…[DR: ‘Verifying’ is a bit too black and white’; all models have limitations.],[The NS text is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions. However, there are many cases in which the predictions of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms. On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as ‘constant relative risk aversion’ or ‘geometric discounting’ can be very credibly tested. We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure ‘how close’ behavior is to the assumption.] Testing Predictions Verifying economic models by asking whether models can accurately predict real-world events. If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid. DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general. 3.7 Positive and normative What’s the difference between the following two statements? ‘An increase in the minimum wage leads to greater unemployment.’ ‘We should reduce the minimum wage, to lessen unemployment’ The first is a positive statement: it looks at ‘what is’ The second is a normative statement: it looks at ‘what should be’ ` Notes:,8 9 Review questions and problems from NS Chapter 1 Note: The ‘review questions’ are fundamental, thought-provoking, and challenging; don’t expect an easy answer! Questions/problems I liked from NS are: Q6. ‘Gasoline sells for $4.00 per gallon this year, and it sold for $3.00 per gallon last year. But consumers bought more gasoline this year than they did last year. This is clear proof that the economic theory that people buy less when the price rises is incorrect.’ Do you agree? Explain. Q8. (This one is conceptual and somewhat tricky!) ‘’Housing advocates often claim that ‘‘the demand for affordable housing vastly exceeds the supply. Use a supply-demand diagram to show whether you can make any sense out of this statement. In particular, show how a proper interpretation may depend on precisely how the word affordable is to be defined.’’ Note: Some questions on the above material will be covered in the first problem set and the tutorial; see VLE links. NS, 11th edition, sidebar↩︎ See site for a further explanation; these topics will also be covered further in this module.↩︎ From Phillip Heap’s 2010 Powerpoint based on NS↩︎ The answer is \\(p=2\\). The consumer will buy 3 units, because the first three units have a value at or above 2… (the amount of food he must forgo for each unit). The producer is also willing to produce three units; the first two she can produce at a cost less than 2, and the third unit at a cost of 2.↩︎ Koo, Won W., and P. Lynn Kennedy. “The impact of agricultural subsidies on global welfare.” American Journal of Agricultural Economics 88, no. 5 (2006): 1219-1226.↩︎ Adv: Previous versions of this hantour had the first statement as ‘We should increase the minimum wage to help low income workers.’ Consider: why do I think this was not a good parallel?↩︎ We will mainly focus on positive statements. However, you are not forbidden from making normative statements, and positive results are useful in making normative judgements. But we should try to be clear which type of statement we are making. Still, much economic research has both positive and normative interpretations and implications. Some economists work on ways of clearly defining and quantifying preferences over social outcomes. Others work on determining determining ‘how to optimise’, with implications for which policies and decisions (for individuals, firms, governments, and nonprofits) will be most efficient and effective at attaining particular goals.↩︎ "]
