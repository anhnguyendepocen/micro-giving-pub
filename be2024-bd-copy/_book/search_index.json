This text aligns with a great deal of this module. I recommend you purchase, or find easy access to some edition of this book (new editions should be £50, used editions should be cheaper), the publisher also sells an online-only version. In the future I hope to turn this online resource into a full interactive, collaborative, open-access online text, adapting material from other open-access resources, but I am not there yet. See some alternative and supplemental free texts and resources BELOW In particular, the open source online text Microeconomics - markets, methods and models by Curtis and Irvine covers much of the same material, and I draw from it substantially (with attribution under the CC license) in this web resource. Principles of Economics - unnamed authors is also very related, and appears pretty good, I also draw from it heavily (with attribution under the CC license) in this web resource. (Referred to as ‘PRUM’) For example, from time to time I will refer you (and draw from) another open source work that has very clear explanations: Quantum Microeconomics… with or without Calculus by Yoram Baumann, the self-proclaimed ‘World’s First Standup Economist’ 1.2 On this module (Exeter: BEE2038 - Intermediate Microeconomics - for students not doing a straight Economics degree) Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics! I hope that this module helps you see the world in a new way and gain insights about business, government, and your everyday life. If you put the time into this module, you can get a lot out of it, and you may gain skills and access approaches that you will use throughout your career. As students at a Russell group institution, I expect you to work hard and engage intellectually to gain a serious and critical understanding of key Economics concepts. Learn how and when these can be applied, what their limitations are, and how these can these are misused and misunderstood. I hope you learn these core ideas well enough that you could explain them to others and apply them to unfamiliar situations. This is not necessary to gain a good mark: I hope that you all will be able to gain a good mark, and I will try to be lenient. But I would suggest you aspire to get more out of this than a mark. You should aim not only to achieve a distinction mark, but to be able to impress me with your understanding and insight, to gird your loins for future courses applying this material, and to gain the acumen to understand key research issues, and participate in business discussions and policy debates. I wrote these notes to outline all of the material you are responsible for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short amount of time we have during lecture. I don’t mean you’re simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that these notes will aim to refer to everything that you are responsible for. These notes are meant to be a complement to the textbook (and to the lectures, tutorials/problem sets, readings and other material on the ELE) and to tie all of this together. (However, as I add to these notes I hope to turn this into an open-access textbook that will replace the text.) I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in these notes. However, each year the module adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to these notes as we go along. I will try to keep you informed of any changes via the VLE forums. Notes versus slides?: These notes should include all of the slide material plus explanatory notes and enrichment material. (However, I left out some of the jokes.) I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will also try to make the slides themselves available after the lectures, even though they are redundant– these notes have everything.1 Some ‘markers’ and abbreviations: ‘NS’ refers to the Nicholson and Snyder text (usually chapters/numbering from the 12th edition is referenced; if you’re using an earlier edition, make sure the content corresponds) ‘CM’ refers to Microeconomics - markets, methods and models by Curtis and Irvine ‘PRUM’ refers to Principles of Economics - unnamed authors, University of Minnesota ‘Adv’ indicates advanced material and discussion you are not required to know but may find interesting, and will help you in later courses/modules in Economics, and give you a hint at what is to come if you pursue this course further. Knowing this stuff might also help your mark and the impression you make when asking for letters of reference. This is also included to give you a more nuanced picture: when I took a similar module as an undergraduate I tended to believe ‘all the economics problems are solved and the solutions and implications are obvious.’ These ‘Adv’ comments are often caveats and critiques. ‘Adv, math’ indicates advanced mathematical material. (I’ve moved most of this to footnotes). Text in blue usually refers to questions you should try to answer on your own (and I sometimes provide suggested answers in the footnotes. Try to answer it yourself first.) Some text is given in gray to indicate that this is a side point or a discussion. (I’m moving most of this to footnotes.) ‘Comprehension Q:’ A question you should be able to answer if you are following along. ‘T numbers’ (take these loosely please) refer to the weeks of term in which I intended to cover specific material. For example ‘T1:03 - T1:04a’ means ‘term 2 week three (both lectures) and term 2 week 4, first lecture only’ 1.3 Course Information Some quick notes on this module and how it fits into your course structure This module is: Compulsory for BSc Business Economics and BA Business Economics Also for PPE I believe The prerequisites are BEE1029 (for most students) or BEE1034 or BEE1030 and BEE1031 The prerequisites are very different, the students in this module may come from diverse backgrounds. We will try to focus on material: not covered in BEE1029 or more rigorous and detailed versions of this, and real world applications, especially in business. Some of you may have already seen some of the material covered here. If so, try to learn it in more detail, become better at explaining it to others, and learn to apply it to real-world issues. Note: From 2020 onwards, all students in this module will come from the “CORE ESPP” You may also find this to be a useful resource, for revision, motivation, and as a supplement to the Nicholson/Snyder text (Also, see “The Economy” 1.0) for more straight Economics A note on maths: As I will explain, this course will involve a certain level of maths; things like simple algebra, understanding what functions are and how to draw them, and understanding the very basic idea that ‘the derivative of a function is a function telling you the slope of the original function’. If you are math-phobic, you need to try to get over this and make maths your friend and your horse. You can ride it for miles! You will also come to notice that I emphasize logic, precise definitions, and careful connected explanations. I don’t want you to be saying/writing things that could be interpreted in multiple ways, like “the demand will go up”. However, this is not the core Economics module (bee2038: Microeconomics II). If you want a more precise, theoretically complete and mathematically rigorus treatment of this material, particularly if you are studying Economics and/or want to go to postgraduate study in a related field you probably should switch to that module. Further suggested maths resources are given below, under (#Other-maths-resources). 2018: Note to students in Managerial economics who took the BEE1034 ‘Economics for Management’ last term I realise that you are facing a special challenge this year because of the changes in this particular prerequisite module, with less ‘conventional Economics’ covere . In 2018 I discussed with your student-staff liaison committee chair on how to give you further support. One of the things she suggested was to point you in the direction of the text Edexcel AS/A level Economics. This should be accessible online. I have looked through this book and I agree that it will be helpful both as a prerequisite and to give you a more basic explanation (A-levels) of some of the things that we are covering in this module. In particular (note these chapters are very short): From “theme one: introduction to markets and market failure” Chapter one: Economics as a social science Chapter 3: the economic problem Chapter 4: production possibility frontiers Chapter 7: rational decision-making Chapter 8: Demand (super-important!) but please don’t use their somewhat imprecise language \"fall/increase in demand/increase in demand) (Chapters 9 and 10 are essentially re-covered from scratch in our module, going beyond A-level material) Chapter 11: Supply Chapter 12: price determination Chapter 13: the price mechanism (much of Chapters 14, 15, and 16 cover material overlapping what we are covering, again at a more basic ‘A-levels’ level; you may find these helpful) From ‘Theme 3: business behaviour and the labour market’ Chapter 42: revenue Chapter 43: Production chapter 44: Costs (we don’t get to all of this in this module) chapter 45: profit Chapter 46: market structure (just to get the basic idea) Chapter 47: perfect competition Chapter 50: monopoly (we re-cover much of this and go a bit further) (Much of these chapters in theme 3, as well as chapter 54, overlaps what we are covering, but at the A-level) I also highly recommend the microeconomics material from the Khan Academy; I will also give you an outline of which sections are most relevant there. Of course I am also very accessible if you have any questions or need clarification, or just want to talk about some of the material you are struggling with. As I always say, you should feel free to come by my office hours or to make a special appointment outside of these hours I think students who have come to my office hours will definitely agree that they have found been helpful and not stressful. I also encourage you to ask specific questions on the ELE student forum which I will answer carefully. You can also ask questions directly on any of the dropbox hosted files if you get a free dropbox account, and I will try to respond to all of these. 1.4 Outline and description Planned syllabus, coverage: The planned module outline is below; as noted, timings may need to be adjusted, and so material may cut for time constraints.

It seeks, in particular, to increase the students’ abilities to, independently, pose and solve economic questions, especially those relating to policy issues. It emphasises the fundamental conceptual foundations in microeconomics and provides concrete examples of their applications.

You also may want to get involved in research (doing it, using it) yourself; let me know if you want to chat about this. If you are thinking of going on to postgraduate study, or are interested in a job involving research, I would strongly advise you to do a final-year undergraduate dissertation. We now have an Economics-specific module for this. You can see some of my research on my webpage and some of my impact projects at @givingtools (twitter) 2.4 This module bee2038: Intermediate Microeconomics (applied) Lectures Problem sets: There are eight problem sets, each covering a specific block of material. The material in these problem sets either comes from exams or builds exam skills. Representative answers for each problem set will be given a few days after each problem set is released, or shortly before the relevant support class. Classes (AKA ‘tutorials’ AKA ‘seminars’) every fortnight (5 total) Support classes will largely focus on covering (exploring, solving, discussing) the problem sets. However, there will obviously not be time to cover every question in the tutorial. Note there are only 5 tutorials but 8 problem sets; thus, tutorials may cover problems from multiple recent problem sets. These classes are about applying material you have learned, not lecturing on it or learning it for the first time. Come ready to ask questions and participate: The classes are a smaller group setting than the lectures; we aim to make these highly interactive and participatory. To really be helpful, we need to know what areas you might be struggling with and where your logic might be breaking down; thus we will either do cold calling or highly encourage all the students in these tutorials to ask and answer questions. Think of these as (especially) ‘safe spaces’; you will be judged or marked based on your performance in the support classes, and there are no dumb questions. If you have a question many of your peers probably have the same question, so asking it provides a public good. Marks for Microeconomics component First ‘midterm’ examination, 90 minutes, fully MCQ (but may require ‘choose all that are correct’); 15 marks (30% of term mark) Final examination, 120 minutes, MCQ, solved problems, short essays: 35 marks (70% of term mark) Important: Final exam open response (essays/short answer) questions test your deep understanding and ability to explain concepts. I will help you prepare for this, and give you examples. Five essential competencies (for economics students) Apply the scientific process to economic phenomena Analyse and evaluate behaviors and outcomes using economic concepts and models Use quantitative approaches in Economics Think critically about economic methods and their applications Communicate economic ideas in diverse collaborations paraphrased from Algood and Bayer, 2017 American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings, “Learning outcomes for economists”. This module particularly emphasizes 5, and also 2 and 4. These skills are also highly relevant to employers updated link: 2.4.1 Texts and resources Recommended text: ‘Intermediate Microeconomics and Its Application’ (12th ed.) Should be available at the University bookstore for around £50, with access to online materials Other recent editions are also OK, but be careful as numbering can change Many other resources online (see below) Note that there are a variety of sources and online courses — any intermediate or advanced textbook in Microeconomics will cover virtually the same material. There are now texts available for free, legally, online, such as Microeconomics Markets, Methods &amp; Models; an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine: A full-fledged text covering many of the topics of this module, without calculus Intermediate microeconomics - M Walbert Illinois tutorials - click ‘tutorials’: A series of tutorials for an intermediate microeconomics module. Covers many of the topics of this module. No calculus but a lot of algebra. Lots of supplementary materials too. Quantum Microeconomics; consider the version either with or without calculus: An unconventional but very careful and interesting approach; my impression is that it is well organised and explained Principles of Economics 2e, Openstax by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine - very well organised, not quite ‘intermediate’, not enough maths for my taste, but may be very helpful as revision and as an additional source of explanations! “Introduction to Economic Analysis”, by Preston McAfee, Caltech and Tracy Lewis, Duke University (note this text uses calculus). Introduction to Economic Analysis - MacAffee, Lewis, Dale: A ‘no-fluff’ text from an esteemed source. Covers much of this module, but a bit at the more advanced side (actually the level varies greatly throughout). Includes calculus and lots of parametric examples. Lots of solved problems. Some resources on CORE , mentioned above, may be helpful, but that needs further investigation, as it is aimed at year-one Economics. I also recommend Simple economics on the web, which contains a great number of useful interactive graphical and algebraic exercises. Play around with this, they are super-helpful and intuitive. Thanks Frank.) Issues with Nicholson and Snyder text and associated online materials: Students can contact Roxanne Watts for access to any online resources associated with the text, roxanne.watts@cengage.com (tel) 01264347322. Expect response to simple questions in 24 hours (1 business day) Note: The module moves through select parts of this textbook; coverage and order given in this ‘handout’, as well as references to coverage in other texts. Lectures \\(\\neq\\) everything!: Some of the material is only mentioned in lecture/handout, but you still must read &amp; learn it (I will be clear on this). On the other hand some sections of the NS text are skipped. Some material is covered in these handouts, or recommended readings, that is not in the text; this is clearly emphasized. All of this is laid out in this handout. 2.5 Problem sets Note: There will be approximately 8 total problem sets, each covering a block of material. As noted above, these are aimed to help prepare you for the assessments. Representative answers and explanations for each problem set will given about 1-week after posting. The five support classes (tutorials) will cover parts of these. 2.6 Feedback on your highly-esteemed but extremely humble lecturer We will have two ‘official’ feedback points. There will be an ‘early feedback’ survey, perhaps around week 4 or 5. This gives you a chance to give me constructive suggestions that I can adapt to during the rest of the module. For the Accelerate end-of-module feedback, you will be asked to rate me. All of these questions are seen as an evaluation of my performance specifically by the “associate dean”. You will be asked to express an opinion, from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’, on one or more questions about the quality of this module. In particular: Overall I am satisfied with the quality of the module. If at any time you think you don’t agree with any of these, please let me know how I can make it better You can tell me directly, or anonymously at: I am not particularly a fan of the “customer service” model of education. It leads lecturers to water-down the content and hinders us from presenting challenging and engaging material. and limit your educational experience. In fact, there is in fairly compelling research that suggests that these measures are not reliable and are “poorly correlated with student learning”. 2.6.1 Responding to feedback I listen carefully to your responses and continually adjust the material and the approach. To give you the best education, I try to follow a process of Kaizen, or continual improvement. I also make changes from year-to-year, in response to your feedback. Some changes made responding to the previous year’s feedback: Before 2019-20 the module was called “BEE2024 Economic Principles and policy”, and it was divided into a Microeconomics term and a Macroeconomics term.\" To make things simpler, we have renamed this Microeconomics part “BEE2038: Intermediate Microeconomics”, and we no longer share the ELE page. However the coverage is the same as before (allowing for normal year-to-year adjustments). Reduced coverage, enabling better focus. In particular, I have eliminated or consolidated much of the material on the firm’s production function and costs. In earlier surveys, this was the topic students liked the least. In 2019 I am removing the coverage of the history of supply and demand curves and a few other topics. Better integration of the problem sets and tutorials with the lectures and the assessments. Better coordination across tutorial sessions. In 2019 I will be providing more practice multiple-choice questions closely emulating the style of MCQ’s that will be on the midterm and final exam Materials: Greater motivation for each lecture. Less content in the slides themselves (less busy). A more complete narrative in the handout files, making these more readable Opportunity to feedback/discuss the handout and problem sets directly on these files (through Dropbox comments) Lectures, tutorials and notes will have a greater focus on carefully explaining the important concepts that many students struggled with (e.g., Expected Utility) I will try to provide more revision coverage and supplementary materials for managerial economics students. 2.7 The story of this module Note: You will have seen many of these concepts before. But do you really understand them well enough to explain them to a non-economist and to apply them to a new real-world situation? And do you understand the limits and critiques of these, and how economists try to measure and test them? Asessment hint: I try to ask you questions that you would not know the answer to had you not taken this module. What would be the purpose of you simply learning ‘common sense’ or ‘conventional wisdom’ … that you already knew? If you are answering an open response/essay question by simply stating something that the average Joe sitting on a pub bench would have said, you may want to rethink the way you are answering this question. I am not designing the exams to trip you up… just to check that you have learned something. *For details on the coverage in each part, and references to coverage in texts other than NS, see the relevant section below, or the outline above 2.7.1 1. Economic basics (weeks 1-2 approx) In weeks one and two we will go over some of the simple tools in the economists’ kit. I will try to explain to you what we mean by ‘economic models’ and give you some examples of these which may be familiar to you. I will not go over the math tools in the lecture; you should study/revise this on your own. We will go over many of these again briefly as we apply these math tools to our economic models throughout the module. We will also start thinking about, and formalisng individual decisions—over nearly all spheres of life— in a way you may not have seen before, which may even strike you as weirdly hyper-rational. Essentially, this (sometimes confusingly called ‘normative decision theory’) is the way economists typically conceive of and model people’s choices. Even though it seems to require precise optimization, perhaps to a strange extent, there are various reasonable justifications for this, and you might also see it as a benchmark… ‘Let’s understand what optimization would look like, as a starting point’. This framework is actually fairly general; it can allow all sorts of preferences (e.g., embodying ‘risk aversion’ and ‘altruism’) and wide-ranging choices. However it does imply certain ‘restrictions’: it rules out some sort of behavior that is perhaps obviously illogical. We will discuss how ‘preferences’ may define the ‘utility functions’. The ‘uility function’ is the thing that make choices in order to maximize. In the classical framework, people make choices in order to maximise the value of their utility function. Utility functions can also be expressed in terms of ‘indifference curves’ (but keep the distinction in mind; the indifference curves are not themselves the utility functions). Under this framework individuals make the ‘optimal choices’ … by making the choices that yield the maximum value of the utility functions given their constraints … in particular they have a ‘budget constraint’ that says they cannot spend more than they earn. You will learn how to derive these budget constraints and plot these on a graph, along with the indifference curves, and to interpret these diagrams. I will also introduce ‘data’ and some key concepts from ‘Empirical analysis’ and ‘Econometrics’ here 2.7.2 2. Building the model, putting it together, examining it (weeks 3-5 approx) ‘What determines the price and quantities exchanged in an unregulated (or ’free’) market?’ ‘Do markets yield good outcomes?’ These questions have been at the backbone of Economics for millennia, at least since Aristotle. Classical economists such as Adam Smith built-up ideas of how seemingly random and disorganized markets can yield predictable and efficient outcomes, at least under appropriate conditions. Neoclassical and modern economists (such as Alfred Marshall, David Ricardo, Leon Walras, and Paul Samuelson) have formalized these, building models involving of systems of demand and supply and general equilibrium, and have made the case for the efficiency and desirability of the free market outcomes, at least under specified conditions.2 In the second (and largest) chunk of the course, we will learn some of the essential building blocks of this model, and how they are justified and put together to yield predictions for market outcomes and ‘welfare’. In the process, we will get useful ideas and intuitions about the working of markets. We will learn how individual optimization implies a relationship between the price of a good (and the consumer’s income) and the amount a consumer chooses to purchase of that good; her individual demand curve. Adding up these individual demand curves yields the market demand curve, which describes the way the total amount of a good consumers wish to purchase depends on the market price of that good. Note: This is covered NS ch. 6-7, but reading these sections is optional. You are only responsible for the brief ‘sketch’ of this that I provide in this handout and in a short lecture, and any problem sets related to this. Someone has to make this stuff, you know! We consider ‘production functions’ that map how inputs can be turned into outputs. If firms are seeking to maximize profits, then whatever output they want to produce … they will try to produce it using the combination of inputs (Capital, labor, etc.) that can do this at the lowest cost. If we know production functions and input costs, we can describe a firm’s cost of producing every amount of a particular good. Economists typically assume that firms make choices to maximize profits. (Mathematically, this ‘optimisation’, i.e., maximisation, has some things in common with the consumer optimisation of utility, so it may look familiar). Knowing their cost of production and the demand curve they will face, firms will thus choose to produce the amount that yields them the highest profit; we will explain the conditions for this. With ‘free entry/exit of firms’ we have the (ideal) situation of perfect competition. Each firm’s supply curve is added up to generate the market supply curve; we consider this in both the ‘short and long run’. We define the concepts of ‘consumer surplus’ and ‘producer surplus’; adding these yields the total value in an economy or the total ‘social welfare’. We will briefly and roughly consider the idea of an equilibrium in all markets; prices such that quantity demanded equals quantity supplied for all outputs and inputs. We will get some sense of the idea of what general ‘economic efficiency’ means. I will state and give you some intuition behind the ‘first and second welfare theorems’; the conditions under which free markets yield ‘good outcomes’, defined in a particular sense. 2.7.3 3. How the market can go wrong (and how to maybe fix it) (weeks 6-7 approx) Notice I kept saying “under certain conditions” free markets yield good outcomes. These conditions may not hold, for various reasons. In the third chunk, we discuss two of these reasons, which lead to ‘market failures’. It is important to understand these. These (sometimes) offer a justification for government intervention, and help us understand how government can best respond. These also offer insights for business models; which ‘goods’ may be hard to provide without government subsidies, and how can we use technological innovation to capture value and reduce the extent of market failures? (Businesses may also be able to take advantage of market failures in ways that are harmful to public welfare, But I would hate to think I’m training you to do this.) Not all goods can easily be restricted to a single consumer. ‘Non-rival’ and ‘non-excludable’ goods (e.g., a fireworks display) are called public goods: these will tend to be undersupplied by the free market, as we will come to understand. We will also discuss the evidence for the private provision of these, and consider government’s ability to provide them. This is the polar opposite market structure to perfect competition; a monopoly is a single firm that exclusively dominated a particular industry. It will tend to produce less and charge more than would be socially optimal, yielding a ‘deadweight loss’ (aka ‘DWL’). ‘Price discrimination’ is (more or less) when a firm charges different prices to different consumers; this can reduce (or increase) the ‘deadweight loss’ of monopoly, as we will learn. 2.7.4 4. Extensions to the model and applications (weeks 8-11 approx) In the final chunk we extend the model to accommodate some important aspects of the real world. We investigate the implication of these for market outcomes. We make many decisions without knowing exactly what the consequence of each choice will be. Economists typically model this using the “expected utility” framework. A warning: students often get this concept wrong, so be careful. Expected utility is not the same as ‘expected monetary value’; and this allows EU to embody risk aversion. For many decisions we make the consequences depend on what others do; we have ‘strategic interaction’. Economist usually consider this using the framework and tools of game theory. People may not actually make decisions In the hyper-rational way we have been assuming. Here we carefully consider the adaptation of some insights from Psychology to Economics, yielding ‘behavioral economics’ 2.8 The big (small) question What’s gonna be on the exam?? As noted, you are responsible for all material outlined in this handout … the syllabus + assigned readings + materials covered in lecture and tutorials. E.g., the exams may cover material only briefly mentioned in lecture, and will expect knowledge from prerequisites I try to reward broad understanding, rather than merely the ability to memorize a few formulae and definitions. So try to really know this stuff and be able to discuss it and apply it, both to algebraic/numerical examples and to real-world issues. I give you copious examples of what will be on the examinations, including practice problems at the end of each lecture, problem sets, lots of mock and sample question on the VLE, and previous examinations and midterms. You need to work hard; here is the guideline specified… Guided Independent Study per half: 143 hours to be divided between background reading (e.g. 40 hrs), solving/reviewing problem sets (e.g. 40 hrs) and exam revision (e.g. 43 hrs) And now, a pep talk. 2.8.1 The real big question: why are you here? To learn. Because you think it’s interesting to ponder big questions about individuals, markets, and society to understand how people have tried to bring order to difficult questions because you want to contribute something to the world (see above) Because this stuff is actually useful in the real world For your professional career For your life If you want to go into academia (in Economics or otherwise) Some people and organisations seem to value this information: 2017 Government Economic Fast Stream Scheme Don’t waste this experience fretting about marks. Try to actually learn and not just mimic the process, as in ‘cargo cults.’ See Richard Feynman, on cargo cult science: So, why are you here? Perhaps not to hear what the lecturer has to say, but for the lecturer to respond to what you say We live in a world post-printing press and with lots of digital media. To be honest, there are some things about lecturing that are obsolete in my opinion. Anyone can hear great lectures online or read extremely informative textbooks. However, as a student at this Russell group University… You can interact with me, ask me questions, come up with ideas, work with other students. Impress me and get a good letter of reference. I advise everyone to come to my office hours at least once. 2.9 Resources I highly advise you to use the forum to ask and answer questions and make suggestions and comments. Students typically find this forum very useful. VLE link Ask questions and make comments on the forum LINK, I will monitor it Or on these notes themselves using hypothes.is Or, for anonymity, just complain on social media and I’ll probably see it. Email For specific questions comments about your degree scheme and requirements, is best to contact the Building One ‘help desk’, or the appropriate help desk for your degree. If you have a question about course material or coverage which other students will be interested in, please post this on the forum. If you email me I may respond by asking you to post this on the form. If you have a specific question that needs private attention then email me and I will try to respond. However, if it is a longer question I may ask you to come to my office hours or schedule a time to meet. Stay tuned for the ‘announcements’ Also, there is a bunch of other material on the VLE. Remember to do practice questions and formative assessments! 2.9.1 In-lecture interaction Even though our lecture time is scarce, It seems to me that to get value out of this antiquated format known as a lecture, we should have at least some interaction. Otherwise, you may as well be watching a video. Some things we may work with include: Responseware, questions, polls and ‘chat’; ‘Kahoot’ In-lecture experiments and games Remember to install Responseware on your smart phones, or get a free turningpoint clicker! Download it on app stores, or use it on a laptop the session id is ‘david’ (check) browser mode: To get the most out of the lectures, I advise you to Ask me questions, especially at beginning and end, raise both hands if you are lost Draw-along and solve-along with the slides and board work. The act of trying to construct models, solve algebra, and draw and interpret diagrams yourself really helps you understand them better and use them 2.10 How to do well Put in the work Read the handout and the relevant parts of the text (as outlined in this handout) in advance of the lecture, come with questions Handouts and lectures mainly follow the text Do the problem set questions, suggested questions and class questions, understand the answers Do the many practice problems and mock exam questions Care about the content Care about actually understanding this stuff. This will be rewarded. Don’t try to game this. It’s easier to just learn this stuff. Try to achieve Real Understanding: Be able to explain this stuff in your own words (in writing) and apply it to new situations Interact and discuss: Peers, Forum, office hours Be careful you know how to interpret the exam instructions correctly, and use your time wisely Skills to hone and build. Your success in this module will depend in large part on building and applying basic maths skills and tools (mainly at the GCSE level), and strong reading/writing/logic abilities. You should build the ability to comprehend and respond carefully and logically to nuanced questions (essay/short answer, solved problem, and multiple choice). These problem will incorporate quantitative reasoning, logic, and the ability to understand and clearly express ideas, to correctly characterise and describe theories and evidence, and to apply learned principles to new situations. This last comment is especially relevant for non-native speakers of English. Students in past years often worried a great deal but got very good marks, and showed good understanding 2.11 Fortune Cookie Wisdom Here are some broad Lessons that I hope you take away from this module, And that will help you throughout… I will come back to these. It may seem like we have the answers, but this is only where we have asked the questions very carefully But sometimes ignorance is bliss. Examples: Sunk-cost fallacy, gains to trade/comparative advantage, opportunity cost, free-riding/prisoners’ dilemma, double-marginalization,‘raise price to raise profit’, etc. I’ve had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife. Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out. We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a ‘single representative consumer’. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights. However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or testing these models, be careful; people may differ and they may change and they may have multiple motives. Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets \\(\\rightarrow\\) opportunities. I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse. I’m not telling you what you need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics. As I also mentioned, these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks. Here are some possible examples. Imperfection: Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘All you can eat’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for ‘all-you-can-eat’ And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later. Free-riding on public goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) Disneyworld, resorts We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride. They then charge an admission fee to ‘be inside of Disney World’ and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods.3 Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Uber, AirBnb Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves). Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Tinder Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high. A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit. If you’re interested, see my research on this here, presentation slides here, my research page is here. Asymmetric information, adverse selection \\(\\rightarrow\\) NHS, ‘Obamacare’ This one is a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA. Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later). There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance ( or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well. Adv: Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you ‘outsource’ And when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do? Much of this work has tried to specify more and more general conditions for this, requiring less and less stringent assumptions.↩ For a different approach see ‘radical xchange’ (sp?), Blockchain and Robert Wiblin 80000 hours podcast episode 63,interview with Vitalik Buterin.↩ "],
["models.html", "3 Economic Models (L1-2) 3.1 What is Economics? 3.2 Why learn these models? 3.3 Economic Models 3.4 Applications 3.5 Basic Supply-Demand Model 3.6 How Economists ‘Verify’ (or Assess) Theoretical Models 3.7 Positive and normative Review questions and problems from NS Chapter 1", " 3 Economic Models (L1-2) – Content largely aligns with Nicholson/Snyder Chapter 1: Economic Models 3.1 What is Economics? Note: DR: It has changed. There are different views. Ask two economists, and you’ll probably get at least three answers. “Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.” “Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” Alfred Marshall Note: The first quote suggests an approach (how we do our research), the second suggests a domain (what we focus on). Note: “Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.” Ludwig von Mises 3.1.1 What is Microeconomics? The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets. Largely, using theoretical and mathematical ‘models’ that depend on strong assumptions. Comprehension Q: Consider some examples of ‘relevant choices’ for economic study. Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications. A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and ‘general’; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications. 3.2 Why learn these models? Consider the parable of the tortoise and the hare (Aesop)… Figure 3.1: Hopelessly unrealistic and useless? One might question the realism of this story: Can hares really speak? Is this a rabbit or a hare? What other animals were racing? Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above questions? The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models. Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop’s fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of ‘Ceteris paribus’ (all other things being equal) can help us here. What do models give us? There are different views of this Via logic and mathematics: Assumptions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Results and sometimes these also yield testable predictions (if the assumptions hold) Do these simplified models yield conclusions that are relevant to the more complicated real world? Maybe, and sometimes. We will consider the evidence. So why learn these models? A starting point (Sometimes) make concrete predictions you can test Building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking Discussion is framed around them and they are seen as a ‘baseline’ Understand the arguments and models to be able to effectively critique or extend them Some critics of what they call ‘neoliberal economics’ can be misinformed about what it is. Their criticism can sound to us mainstream economists like someone who says ‘cars are dangerous and should be banned because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping’ 3.3 Economic Models Economic model: Simple theoretical description that captures the essentials of how the economy works.4 3.3.1 The PPF: a ‘model’ and a way of seeing things The “production possibility frontier” (PPF) illustrates all the combinations of two (or more) goods that can be produced … by a firm, a family, an economy, globally, etc. Each point is a combination of the amount of the ‘x-axis’ and ‘y-axis’ good. All points on or below the curve are achievable; all points above cannot be produced. Figure 3.2: source: tutor2u Figure 3.2: source: tutor2u Figure 3.2: source: tutor2u Above, we see a depiction of the PPF, the concept of diminishing marginal return, and the concept of inefficiency (from tutor2u.)5 You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced. I’m not sure if I would call it a ‘model’, but it certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions. This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now. Note: For comprehension: Draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means. See fig 1.1 Advanced: Consider … what assumptions does the PPF (implicitly) make? PPF illustrates key principles Principle 1: Scarce Resources Principle 2: Scarcity involves opportunity cost.6 Notes: ‘’The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it.’’(NS, 2011) ‘Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative forgone in making any choice.’ PRUM, chapter 1, section ‘Opportunity Cost’ The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone ‘next best’ opportunity from a choice. I may just call this ‘cost’ Comprehension question (advanced): Think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the ‘cost’ and the economists’ definition of an ‘opportunity cost’ On the PPF the opportunity cost of more clothing is less food. Principle 3: Opportunity costs are (often) increasing. What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases. To produce more and more clothing you would have to give up increasing amounts of food. The “law” of diminishing marginal returns. I’m somewhat sceptical of this being a ‘law’; there are certainly increasing returns in certain regions. However, you will see it again and again as it is a fairly standard assumption. You should read and consider these applications on your own. They will show how the economic principles and theory can be applied to the real-world and test and improve your understanding of the theory. 3.4 Applications 3.4.1 Application 1.1: Economics in the Natural world (NS) The NS textbook presents many interesting applications. These offer you the opportunity to test your knowledge and understanding and apply it to real-world situations. These can also be helpful on assessments; applications may come up, and it may be useful to refer to these and supporting your points on free answer questions. Studies of honeybees have found that they generally do not gather all of the nectar in a particular flower before moving on. (NS) Why not? Adv: What key features do modern human economies have that ‘animal economies’ don’t have? Largely: trade, prices, specialisation, free choice vs instinct. The economics of trade may also apply to the natural world in certain ways. Adv: Above, we see the working of ant-aphid symbiosis, a form of mutualism. Relevant to the ‘conditions necessary for trade to occur’? The ants ‘farm’ the aphids, who secrete nice substances. In return the ants protect the aphids and only sometimes eat them. 3.4.2 Is university worth the time and money The NS text has an application “Is It Worth Your Time to Be Here?” This is a contentious issue, especially in the USA, where private university tuitions run at over £40,000 per year (for a four-year course!) There is constant popular discussion of this. See, e.g., … Please stop asking whether college is worth it Is your university degree barely worth the paper it’s written on? Discuss The case against education, Bryan Caplan; LSE review Consider: Social vs private returns. Is there a case for ‘market failure’? 3.4.3 NS Application 1.3: Rise and Fall of Blockbuster {-} link Critical contemporary business challenge: (Note NS edition 12 is updated and discusses Netflix, etc) Blockbuster and Netflix are selling what we call information goods. These have a zero marginal (distribution) cost. They are competing with online merchants. This is characteristic of many things ‘online’ In a turnabout in policy, Blockbuster agreed to give the studios a substantial share (as much as 40 percent) of the revenues from its movie rentals in exchange for price reductions of up to 90 percent. (NS, application 1.3) (Why) was this a good business move? Was it efficient from a social point of view? 3.5 Basic Supply-Demand Model …Describes how a good’s price and the quantity exchanged are determined Determined by the preferences, behaviour, and costs of potential buyers and sellers Note: in 2019 we will not be covering the historical background to the Marshallian cross (the demand and supply you may be familiar with). However, I do expect you to understand this model itself. 3.5.1 Marshall’s Model of Supply and Demand Economists and philosophers have long sought to explain ‘what determines the prices, and why do they change the way they do?’ In the 19th century UK prices were falling while quantities were increasing; this was a puzzle. Alfred Marshall argued that a good’s price must equal both the cost to produce and the value (to consumers) of the last unit produced and consumed. He introduced the ‘demand curve’; with a downward slope. This slope was justified by ‘satiation’: for an individual, additional units of a good are usually valued less and less. For example, you might be willing to pay thousands of pounds to be able to access 100 gallons of water rather than no water at all, but if you already have access to a thousand gallons of water, you will not be willing to pay very much for an additional 100 gallons. Furthermore, firms must cater to less and less keen consumers as they wants to sell more and more units. We come back to this later in the module. ‘Willingness to pay’ (wtp) becomes less and less for the next unit purchased, so will buy more only at a lower price. Equivalently, at a lower price more people find the value exceeds the price, and for additional units. Note that we will also return to these questions in more depth in later chapters as we build up the demand and supply curves. With ‘single crossing’ (a fancy condition you can ignore in this module) there is a unique price where \\(Q^s(p)=Q^d(p)\\), and a unique quantity where the last unit’s value to the consumer equals its cost to produce. Scissors analogy The equilibrium model is analogised to a pair of scissors; neither scis cuts alone So don’t ask ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged’? Understand why ‘Just like neither scis cuts alone, neither the supply nor the demand curve determines the equilibrium price and quantity in isolation’? Adv: Consider: What does it mean to be at equilibrium, and how do we get there? Draw: the famous Marshallian cross Can you explain? The inefficiency of any price other than where \\(Q^D(p)=Q^S(p)\\)? If the price was set at a different value, what forces might push it to the equilibrium? Suggested ans: To economists, a ‘shortage’ is where, at the prevailing or imposed price, consumers are willing to buy more than is available. Some consumers get value from the good in excess of the price. In such a case, firms might offer a higher price, or sellers might ask for a higher price. The price rise would reduce quantity demanded (not ‘reduce demand’) and increase quantity supplied (not ‘reduce supply’). Harder question: Who gains or suffers with a government-imposed price floor/ceiling? To respect yourself in the morning, you must know Which factors cause the supply and demand curves to shift? What causes ‘movements along’ the supply or demand curve? Note: Caveat, to avoid later confusion: These models assume ‘price-taking’; neither buyers nor sellers consider the impact of their choices on prices Do US, EU, and Japanese farm subsidies help or hurt Africans in net? This is discussed in NS application 1.4 (Economics According to Bono) as well as in an academic article ‘The Impact of Agricultural Subsidies on Global Welfare’: Developing countries strongly oppose domestic and export subsidies by developed countries. Since developing countries cannot afford to support their producers at the levels of developed countries, subsidies tend to limit fair competition. In general, both domestic and export subsidies distort production patterns. Some argue that subsidies given to produc- ers in developed countries have resulted in overproduction and lower world prices of agricultural goods, which have been harmful to agriculture in developing countries. Others have argued that although subsidies distort trade flows, they have been beneficial for consumers in both exporting and importing countries, resulting in a net increase in global welfare, especially in developing importing countries (Bhagwati 2004). This is mainly because subsidies lower world prices for agricultural goods - Koo and Kennedy (2006) This will be skipped in lecture, but please read it; it may come up on an exam. Think about: what do we mean ‘in net’? No obvious theoretical or empirical answers Microeconomic theory helps us consider it, and look for answers Should hurt African farmers Should help African consumers … Which effect dominates (change in African profit less change in African consumer surplus)? … Note: Fig. 1 in NS text depicts African supply/demand mapped against world price 3.6 How Economists ‘Verify’ (or Assess) Theoretical Models This will be skipped in lecture, but we will come back to some of these ideas later. Two methods: Testing Assumptions ‘Verifying’ economic models by examining validity of assumptions upon which models are based. Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.? Notes…[DR: ‘Verifying’ is a bit too black and white’; all models have limitations.],[The NS text is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions. However, there are many cases in which the predictions of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms. On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as ‘constant relative risk aversion’ or ‘geometric discounting’ can be very credibly tested. We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure ‘how close’ behavior is to the assumption.] Testing Predictions Verifying economic models by asking whether models can accurately predict real-world events. If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid. DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general. 3.7 Positive and normative What’s the difference between the following two statements? ‘An increase in the minimum wage leads to greater unemployment.’ ‘We should reduce the minimum wage, to lessen unemployment’ The first is a positive statement: it looks at ‘what is’ The second is a normative statement: it looks at ‘what should be’ ` Notes:,7 8 Review questions and problems from NS Chapter 1 Note: The ‘review questions’ are fundamental, thought-provoking, and challenging; don’t expect an easy answer! Questions/problems I liked from NS are: Q6. ‘Gasoline sells for $4.00 per gallon this year, and it sold for $3.00 per gallon last year. But consumers bought more gasoline this year than they did last year. This is clear proof that the economic theory that people buy less when the price rises is incorrect.’ Do you agree? Explain. Q8. (This one is conceptual and somewhat tricky!) ‘’Housing advocates often claim that ‘‘the demand for affordable housing vastly exceeds the supply. Use a supply-demand diagram to show whether you can make any sense out of this statement. In particular, show how a proper interpretation may depend on precisely how the word affordable is to be defined.’’ Note: Some questions on the above material will be covered in the first problem set and the tutorial; see VLE links.

Firstly, note that the Nicholson and Snyder text has a very relevant and useful appendix 2 chapter 1 specifically covering the most important maths; I have also echoed these in the handout. I covered it in some previous years (can you view the recap HERE? I covered it from minute 31, about), but it didn’t seem so helpful to try to cram all of this into a lecture, so I stopped doing it. Warwick maths notes The University of Warwick put up some decent ‘refresher notes’ for incoming economic students. I’ve re-hosted these on my Dropbox, with some comments on which parts are more relevant.

Khan academy: , e.g., see their introduction to differential calculus. Some Khan courses/sections I would recommend in particular Pre-algebra (you should know all of this) Algebra basics (all of this) Algebra I (nearly all of this is relevant, accepting a few things like irrational numbers) Algebra II (‘Functions’ and possibly a few other parts) Statistics (mainly just ‘discrete random variables’; especially the ‘mean’) Helpful: Calculus as ‘rates of change’; just the basic concept of a derivative 4.2 Simple stuff Please note: if this depiction is too abbreviated, please consult the NS text, or the Khan academy and Warwick resources mentioned above! I expect to cover this in the second lecture (Univariate) Function A ‘map’ from one or more variables (\\(x\\)) (or ‘variables’) to an outcome (\\(y=f(x)\\)) for each value of \\(x\\) the function tells you a single value of \\(f(x)\\); typically we assign \\(y=f(x)\\) Note: ‘Variables’ are more formally called the ‘arguments’ of a function Linear function A function of the form \\(y=a+bX\\); e.g., \\(y = f(x) = -10 + 3x\\) Plotted as a straight line; intercept \\(a\\), constant slope \\(b\\) (Technically this is an ‘affine’ function; a linear function doesn’t have an intercept) Adv, Maths: For strictly linear functions (not including functions with constants) \\(f(a X_1 + b X_2) = a f(X_1) + b f(X_2)\\) for any values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) In particular ‘the function of the average is the average of the functions’ (this also holds for affine functions).

Arc slope: slope over a range Point slope: slope of the tangent to a curve at a point Nonlinear (univariate) function : A function \\(f(x)\\) of a form other than \\(f(x) = y=a+bX\\); E.g., a quadratic function \\(y = f(x) = a + bx + cx^2\\) E,g, \\(y = f(x) = 10 - 2x + 3x^2\\) Or a logarithmic \\(y=ln(x)\\) or exponential function \\(y = exp(x)\\) Note: I will try to limit things to linear and quadratic functions, and possibly exponential and log functions. I will remind you of the rules for dealing with these whenever it is necessary. For linear functions the slope is the same at any point. For nonlinear functions it may differ at each point. Think of the slope of a mountain versus the slope of a wheelchair ramp. Consider the original values of \\(x\\) -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 Now consider the linear function \\(y = f(x) = 3+2x\\). Applying this function to these values yields -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Now consider the quadratic function \\(y = g(x) = -x^2+15x\\). Applying this function to these values yields -54, -34, -16, 0, 14, 26, 36. Putting this all together: A linear function: 2+2x A quadratic function: -x^2+10x x y=f(x) y=g(x) -3 -4 -39 -2 -2 -24 -1 0 -11 0 2 0 1 4 9 2 6 16 3 8 21 The point here is that increasing X by 1 has the same effect on Y wherever you start, for a linear function but a different effect depending on where you start for a nonlinear function Instantaneous rate of change (instantaneous slope) The slope of the line tangent to the curve at a single point Adv, Math: This is the limit of the ‘rise over run’ as the run goes to zero Convex function: Slope everywhere increasing, unique minimum where slope \\(=0\\) Concave function: Slope everywhere decreasing, unique maximum where slope \\(=0\\) Note: we are referring to the signed value of the slope here, not the absolute value. E.g., for the convex case depicted, it goes from a negative slope to a zero slope to a positive slope For these functions the slope is different at each point. Note: We will mainly deal with functions like these, with a single minimum or maximum that occurs at the unique point with slope zero. Quadratic function are convex if the \\(x^2\\) term has a positive sign and concave if it has a negative sign. That’s because at extreme values of x the term with the largest exponent will dominate all other terms. Example of a convex function: Tiger’s golf earnings per game as function of hours of golf retraining… he had to get worse before he could get better, they say. Or cost per smoothie as function of employees behind smoothie counter. One example of a concave function: how funny I am as function of beers I drink (on the other hand, how funny I think I am may be an everywhere increasing function. Derivative of a function A derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) is another function called \\(f&#39;(x)\\). \\(f&#39;(x)\\) tells us the slope of the function \\(f(x)\\) at any point \\(x\\). For example, the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2\\) For this linear function the slope is a constant, 2 We will come back to the following examples later. E.g., the derivative of the quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2x - 4\\) derivative of the quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2x - 4\\) E.g., the slope at \\(x=1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x;x=1) = 1*1 - 4 = -2\\) The slope is zero where \\(f&#39;(x)=2x-4=0\\), or where \\(x=2\\) Is \\(x=2\\) at a min, a max, or neither? How do we know? 4.3 Minimum, maximum, or neither? \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is a function that tells us the slope of \\(f(x)\\), or how \\(f(x)\\) changes in \\(x\\) at any point \\(x\\) In turn, the derivative of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is called \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\). This tells us how the slope changes as \\(x\\) increases Oversimplifying a bit: (Adv, Math: Essentially, for a class of functions where the domain is not bounded) if the slope is always increasing, i.e., if \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) everywhere, the function is convex (u-shaped), and has a single minimum where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) if the slope is always decreasing, i.e., if \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) everywhere, the function is concave (inverse-u-shaped), and has a single maximum where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) 4.4 Functions of two or more variables (multivariate functions) Utility, profit, cost, production, returns, etc. May depend on multiple variables/inputs Need to illustrate tradeoffs between these \\[y=f(x,z)\\] \\(y\\) may increase and/or decrease in \\(x\\) and in \\(z\\) The rate of increase of y in \\(x\\) may depend on the values of \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) Similar for the rate of increase of y in z E.g., \\[y=\\sqrt(xz) = x^{1/2}z^{1/2}, x \\geq 0, z \\geq 0\\] Note the outcome will increase in each argument at a decreasing rate. What does it look like? 3d: project up to y from a “map” of x and z coordinates on the desk. This is hard to picture; ‘contour lines’ can help. Projecting a function up from X,Y space into the Z axis: 4.5 Contour lines (we will come back to this later) Contour lines Level sets - depict combinations of variables that hold the function constant at a particular value f(x,z) = A for some value \\(A\\) Level sets: E.g., indifference curves, isoquants and isocost curves. Don’t worry if you find this discussion of level sets confusing. We will come back to it later in the module for a more specific case. Note: It is difficult to depict more than 2 dimensions on a piece of paper. So we find the values for the 2 variables that give us a particular value for the third … which tells us how these trade off. Consider a production function: \\[Y = f(K,L) = \\sqrt(KL)\\] Setting this equal to 1 we can map out ‘all combinations of K and L that produce output \\(Y=1\\)’. We do this by solving for the amount of K needed to produce 1 as a function of L and then plotting this against a range of L \\[ Y = \\sqrt(KL) = 1 \\rightarrow KL = 1 \\] \\[ \\rightarrow K = 1/L \\] Setting this at Y = 2 \\[ Y = \\sqrt(KL) = 2 \\rightarrow KL = 4 \\] \\[ \\rightarrow K = 4/L \\] Let’s see the value of this function for some random combinations of K and L: K &lt;- rep(c(1,2,3,4), each = 4) L &lt;- rep(c(1,2,3,4), times=4) y &lt;- sqrt(K*L) contour_ex &lt;- hux(data.frame(K,L,y)) %&gt;% huxtable::add_colnames() %&gt;% theme_plain #knitr::include_graphics(&quot;contourcombos.png&quot;) For values of K 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4 and L 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 we have the values of \\(y=\\sqrt(K\\times L)\\): K L y 1 1 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 2 1.41 1 3 1.73 1 4 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 1 1.41 2 2 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 3 2.45 2 4 2.83 3 1 1.73 3 2 2.45 3 3 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 4 3.46 4 1 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 2 2.83 4 3 3.46 4 4 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that different combinations of K and L yield the same Y. E.g., in the above table we see three distinct pairs of K and L yielding Y=2. We can consider ’what combinations of values of this function yield a particular value? Connect values of K and L that lead to the same value of y yields ‘level sets’ or ‘contour lines’. Below, we plot all combinations of X and Z that satisfy \\(Y = \\sqrt(XZ)\\), for three values of Y: Y=1, Y=2, and Y=3. eq = function(x){1/x} eq2 = function(x){2/x} eq3 = function(x){3/x} ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 3)), aes(x=x)) + stat_function(fun=eq, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(colour = &quot;Y=1&quot;)) + stat_function(fun=eq2, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(colour = &quot;Y=2&quot;)) + stat_function(fun=eq3, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(colour = &quot;Y=3&quot;)) + xlab(&quot;X&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Z&quot;) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,3)) Figure 4.1: contour lines for Y = sqrt(XZ) 4.6 Simultaneous equations As shown above, the pair of equations \\[ y =-x+7 \\] \\[ y=2x+1 \\] holds only where \\(x=2\\) and \\(y=5\\).9 Another example \\[ X + Y = 3 \\] \\[ X - Y = 1 \\] Holds only where \\(X=2, Y=1\\), the ‘unique solution’ Note: Be sure you know how to solve the above. Adv math: Note, in general, we need as many equations as unknowns (above 2 of each) to possibly be able to find a solution. However, some sets of equations have no solution, and some may have multiple solutions. Consider plotting overlapping lines, or parrallel lines, and looking for the point(s) of intersection. It is meaningless to ask ‘how does a change in X affect Y?’ in the above context. Equally meaningless: ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged?’ in a demand-supply Marshallian cross. 4.7 Empirical microeconomics/econometrics Empirical research Uses evidence from the real world, i.e., observation, to answer questions (rather than introspection and theory) Econometrics The ‘science’ of using data to answer economic questions Uses statistical tools and often economic theory Micro-data Data where the unit of observation is an individual, household, firm, etc. (Contrasts from macro-data, data on aggregates like GDP, inflation, etc.) Adv: Econometrics often has a different focus and different methodology than ‘regular statistics’. Econometrics has taken on a larger role in economics over the past 40 years, because of greater data availability and computing power. Most published papers in economics now involve some econometric analysis. 4.8 Empirical meta-example (A bit advanced) Suppose we are trying to estimate the market demand curve; suppose we hypothesize that this demand curve is a linear function. (I.e., suppose we assume that quantity demanded is a linear function of price). \\[Q_d = a-bp\\] Suppose we know that price is changing because of cost changes, shifts in supply curve, or the firm experimenting Adv: Otherwise the problem is poorly identified, as demand and supply will jointly determine price We observe price and quantity data for a period where ceteris paribus is reasonable, such as the data below10 We try to fit the ‘best’ line through these points (minimizing the distances between the line and the points, or minimizing the ‘error’ of this predicted quantity) We estimate the demand curve’s slope and intercept. We can use this to make inferences. This line will never fit exactly, because of unobserved differences, nonlinear demand, measurement error, randomness in behaviour. But this fitted line is only meaningful if we are observing shifts in the supply curve and not the demand curve! (Can you explain why?) 4.8.1 Ceteris paribus All [most] economic theories employ the assumption that ‘other things are held constant.’ In above data/figure, demand may differ between weeks/stores, weather may change, etc. ‘the points may lie on several different demand curves, and attempting to force them into a single curve would be a mistake.’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) We would like to carefully ‘control’ for other observable factors Adv: May also use flexible functions permitting heterogeneity – differing slopes. We can never control for everything or know ‘true’ functional forms. Sadly, all empirical work involves imperfect compromises. But happily there are ways to test and validate the estimates, e.g., see how well they predict future outcomes. 4.9 Changing world oil prices NS application 1A.3 in NS, also discussed in PRUM section 4.1. This will be probably skipped in lecture, but please read it. This may be referred to in problem sets/tutorials. This is a great example from perhaps the most important unified global market, with tremendous fluctuations that have huge impacts. It shows the power of empirical microeconomics. (Note edition 12 updates.) Henceforth we will refer to: the market demand curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as \\(Q_D(P,...)\\) and the market supply curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as \\(Q_S(P,...)\\). The quantity (units of a good) that firms in the market are willing to supply is a function of the price and other ‘background’ things. The total quantity that consumers in the market or willing to demand is a different function of the price of other things. We typically these ‘supply curve’, and ‘demand curve’, respectively, but I want to to think of these as functions that can shift. I don’t want you to write ‘demand went down’; that is ambiguous. The price where these quantities are equal is the ‘prevailing price in the market’. We build this up throughout the next sections in more detail. Getting back to the example… Empirical work has estimated the equations below, the estimated supply and demand curves expressed in dollars and millions of barrels, from an earlier period: \\[ Q_D = 85 - 0.4P \\: (D) \\] \\[ Q_S = 55 + 0.6P \\: (S) \\] Setting \\(Q_S=Q_D\\) and solving this yields: \\(85 - 0.4P=55+0.6P \\rightarrow P = 30, Q = 73\\) Note: This is the sort of simultaneous equation you should be able to solve. This approximates the 2000-2002 price So what accounted for price rise in 2008 to about US$130, and then fall to US$50 by March 2009? China and India’s economy grew, implying a growth in the world economy by 3-4% per year Various calculations imply that this represents a shifting out in the Demand curve from \\(Q_D = 85 - 0.4P\\) to: \\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\\] Side note: I think the ‘new demand’ curve comes from an approximation: if the world economy grew at 4% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it’s previous size. … thus the growth is \\(1.047^7=1.316\\). They assume oil’s demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112. Note that the text has a typo: equation 3 on page 40, the new demand, should read \\(Q=112-0.4P\\). With the same supply curve and the new demand curve we have \\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\\] \\[Q_S = 55 + 0.6P\\] This \\(\\rightarrow\\) solves to \\(P=57, Q=87\\) Furthermore, overall price inflation, US$ devaluation \\(\\rightarrow\\) accounts for about a price of US$94 So why was did the price move to $130? Other changes included: Speculation, other disruptions. Supply may have also shifted (political turmoil, new sources of energy, etc.) Do you know the current price of oil per barrel in USD and GBP? 4.10 Data and economic analysis (Curtis and Irvine) Please read from Microeconomics - markets, methods and models by Curtis and Irvine sections 2.2 (you can skip ‘index numbers’ for now if you like) section 2.3 4.11 Between first and second week; priority home-study Make sure you are following along. Can you answer the questions mentioned above and in the lecture? E.g., can you explain why (supply) demand curves slope (upwards) downwards? Can you solve a system of two equations (supply, demand) for an equilibrium price and quantity? What causes shifts versus movements along the demand curve? Do you know what ‘micro-data is’? Would you be able to identify it if you saw it? At this point, you should be able to do problem set 1. Please do at least get a start on it. After week 1, before week 2 lectures, be sure you have read/understood all of the ‘handout’ and corresponding material up to this point. To prepare for the week 2 lectures, you should look ahead at the readings and handout material (below). In particular, read and consider the material on ‘preference axioms’, ‘utility functions’, and how the latter are depicted using indifference curves. These are difficult and somewhat abstract concepts; try to test your understanding and bring questions (or ask these on the VLE or in this text with hypothes.is)! If you have time, please also start considering the budget constraints and conditions for consumer optimisation. In particular, the ‘bang for the buck’ condition is something you will want to look at closely to get your head around it.

Reinstein, David. “The Economics of the Gift.” (2014). Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study) Understand what ‘utility’ is and how is it defined and modeled Understand the assumptions economists usually make about preferences (choices) and their implications Learn how to depict preferences and utility with ‘indifference curves’ and how to interpret these … with examples like ‘perfect substitutes’ and ‘perfect complements’ Learn what ‘budget constraints’ are and how to compute and model them Understand ‘maximising utility subject to constraints’ and the conditions for optimisation involving price ratios and marginal rates of substitution Learn how to depict this optimisation in a graph with indifference curves and budget constraints …and how to interpret this graph 5.2 Preamble to utility and choice We now consider the very very fundamental building blocks behind the (in)famous ‘neoclassical economics model.’ If you accept these ‘axioms’ nearly everything flows from it! 5.3 Some motivation for these abstract ideas Consider a decision you recently made? Define this decision clearly; what were the options? How do you think you decided among these options? What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the same decision? If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same situation again. Do you think you’d make the same decision? Suppose I asked you: ‘State a rule that governs how people do make decisions’… I want this rule to be both Informative (it rules out at least some sets of choices) and Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule). Suppose I asked an apparently similar question: ‘State a rule that governs how people should make decisions’.. By ‘should’ I mean that they will not regret having made decisions in this way. If people did follow these rules, what would this imply and predict? Economists (and decision theorists/decision scientists) have specifically defined such rules in terms of ‘axioms about preferences’ They have started from these ‘reasonable axioms’ and followed their logical implications for individual choices, individual responses to changes in prices and income, market prices and quantities and their responses, ‘welfare’ and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc. The ‘Standard axioms’ (imply that) choices can be expressed by ‘individuals maximising utility functions subject to their budget constraints’. This yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc. Note: Part 2 (NS ch 2-3) involves building the demand curve from first principles, and discussing how to interpret it Notes: We want to develop a model that can be used to show how we make choices or decisions. In the (neo) classical economics framework, your (optimising) choices are determined by two things: Preferences: what goods do you like? Constraints: how much money do you have, what are the prices of the goods you buy? Second problem set, first part (NS chapter 2): Preferences, Utility, Consumer optimization, individual and market demand 5.4 Utility Utility “The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity.” Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions Adv: There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature Adv: A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated, thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, ‘utility’, which is maximised. 5.5 Utility from two goods We may specify a “utility function” of two goods (or aggregations of goods) \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\): \\[Utility = U(X,Y; other)\\] We can get a lot of insight from considering models Of an individual’s preferences over only two goods. These two ‘goods’ could represent, for example: Leisure and ‘goods consumption’ Food and non-food Coffee and tea (holding all else constant) Maths revision: \\(U(X,Y)\\) expresses a function with two arguments, X and Y. At this point, you may want to return to the revision material covering functions of two or more variables. Math-multivariate functions \\(U(X,Y)\\) must take some value for every positive value of X and Y. In general a function of X and Y might increase or decrease in either X or Y, or increase over some ranges and decrease over other ranges of these two arguments. For example, consider the function ‘altitude of land in Britain as a function of degrees longitude and latitude’. \\(U(X,Y)\\) expresses a general function; I haven’t specified what this function is. E.g., it could be \\(U(X,Y)=\\sqrt(XY)\\). 5.6 Measuring and comparing utilities Adv: This is a difficult but well-studied issue, as it is important for methodology and welfare analysis. In more detailed discussions, we might speak of ‘cardinal utility’, ‘ordinal utility’, etc., to indicate the ways we can or cannot compare utility between individuals and in response to policy changes. Utility is not ‘observable and measurable in utils’ Utility is seen to govern an individual’s choices and thus it’s only inferred indirectly, from the choices people make Who gets ‘more’ utility? We don’t know. Also, considering a transfer from Al to Betty: Is the reduction in Al’s utility more or less than the increase in Betty’s? Revealed preference: if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a dog was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat. As we only get at utility through an individual’s decisions, we have no reliable way to compare it across individuals. 5.7 Assumptions about preferences (‘axioms’) Completeness: Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive. Transitivity (internal consistency): If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C. More is Better (nonsatiation) 1. Completeness The following is forbidden: “I cannot choose between a ski holiday and a beach holiday, yet I am not indifferent between these.” Why wouldn’t I be able to express a preference? In the case above that seems strange, but for other cases it may be extremely difficult or painful to make a choice, or very hard to compare two things. Imagine if you were asked to choose between never seeing your mother or never seeing your father. In general, economists’ standard approach assumes we have a consistent preference ranking over all possibilities, and choose accordingly. Other social sciences see this differently/ Also ‘forbidden’ in the classical model: the time or frame in which I make the decisions must not affect my choices. This will be relaxed when we discuss behavioral economics. Fancy notation: Either A preferred to B, B preferred to A, or A indifferent to B \\[A \\succ B, B \\succ A, \\: or \\: A \\sim B \\] You don’t have to know this notation, but it may be a helpful shorthand 2. Transitivity \\[ A \\succ B \\: and \\: B \\succ C \\rightarrow A \\succ C \\] Similar for indifference (\\(\\sim\\)) If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer an Apple to a Cherry. A similar idea holds if I am indifferent between one pair of these. If this seems confusing it may be because it is too obvious (although behavioral and experimental economists claim to find violations). Adv: If you found someone who stricly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them! In more detail… Intuitively: Transitive preferences are ‘internally consistent’: If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C. Loosely, I might expect this if I think that a person has preferences that can be ranked in a normal way. The standard ‘utility framework’ takes this for granted. If we have any rule over preference such as ‘more is better’ or ‘tastier is better’, this should hold. Also, someone whose makes choices following preferences that are not transitive may quickly be impoverished by a shrewd trader. We do not see this happening in general. If you found someone who strictly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them. This is easiest to illustrate if we allow these goods to be non-discrete and assume ‘more is always better.’ It works as follows: Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry. Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of banana (or ‘money’). Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra. Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra. … Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you’ve drained all of their resources. (Final) Exam question: What are ‘transitive preferences’? Give an example of a person making choices that seem to reflect preferences that are extit{not} transitive, and explain how you could ‘pump money’ from this person.11 3. More is better (‘global nonsatiation’) Perhaps this seems unreasonable? One way you might justify it: If the product is a ‘bad’ (e.g., pollution), redefine the product as the absence of the product. The darkly shaded area above represents those combinations of X and Y that are unambiguously preferred to the combination X*, Y*. This is why goods are called ‘goods’; individuals prefer having more of any good rather than less. Combinations of X and Y in the lightly shaded area are inferior to the combination \\(X^{\\ast}, Y^{\\ast}\\), whereas those in the questionable areas may or may not be superior to \\(X^{\\ast}, Y^{\\ast}\\). Who cares? If people obey the first two above assumptions/axioms, the completeness and transitivity\\(\\ast\\), they will make choices in a way consistent with maximising a (continuous) utility function. (… OK, maybe you still don’t care, but economists do.) (Technically, we also require something called ‘continuity’, which also yields continuous utility and demand curves that don’t have jumps, but we won’t discuss this).12 We are not saying people actually consult a utility function. That would be a dumb thing to say. We are considering that ‘people behave as if they are maximizing utility functions’; this is (basically) equivalent to saying \"people choose based on preferences that satisfy the above assumptions. These axioms stand directly behind ‘revealed preference’ methods for measuring how much people value nonmarket goods, like clean air and national parks. It also gives us a vocabulary and a way to test for violations of this consistency, and make alternate predictions. Also…13 How can we compare the “?” areas? Which are preferred? \\(\\rightarrow\\) Compare utilities, depict this using Indifference Curves 5.8 Voluntary trades and indifference curves Indifference curve A curve that shows all the combinations of goods or services that provide the same level of utility. Formally (for 2 goods), the set of pairs of \\({X,Y}\\) such that \\(U(X,Y)=c\\) for some constant \\(c\\)14 Consider the above diagram15 . Think of this as a map with a projection above it. How far East you go on this map determines how much of the x good is consumed How far North you go determines how much of the Y good is consumed. How high is the projected image… Determines how much utility is obtained from this combination of goods X and Y.16 The above diagram also includes color to depict the utility level, like a ‘heat map.’17 You can find further revision of this basic content at Khan Academy Properties of indifference curves Note for above: Suppose you are someone that likes hamburgers and soft drinks. If this is too difficult to imagine, think of two healthy goods, like runner beans and green tea. Note that the period of consumption—a day, a year, or a lifetime—is not specified. Note: I’ve asked this as a MCQ on exams! (Answers to most comprehension questions are given in footnotes. Try to answer it yourself before looking at the footnote.)18 Q: How do we know \\(E \\succ B\\) ?19 Q: How do we know \\(E \\succ A\\) ?20 Even though these concepts are rather abstract, we can already apply this to an interesting question that has been central to economics throughout history. Why is there ‘voluntary trade’ (between individuals)? This gives us insight into why people trade with one another. Considering figure 2.2 (above and in the NS text), an individual is ok with giving up soda for hamburgers or vice/versa along her indifference curve. A trade that put her above the IC makes her ‘strictly’ better off. So consider if one individual had allocation D and another allocation A, and they had the same preferences. What trade could they make to make each of them better off? 5.9 Marginal rate of substitution (MRS): Absolute value of slope of indifference curve The MRS measures the maximum amount of one good (\\(Y\\)) that you would be willing to give up in order to gain one more unit of another good (\\(X\\)). I.e., this would be the amount you could give up of \\(Y\\) when you gain one unit of \\(X\\) and be no worse or better off. You are ‘indifferent’ to making this change.21 Returning to fig 2.2: Moving from A to B: She is willing to give up 2 burgers to get 1 more soda. \\(\\rightarrow\\) Here the slope \\(-2\\), implying a \\(MRS=2\\)22 From B to C? (think about it) willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1 more soda \\(\\rightarrow MRS =1\\) C to D? \\(MRS = \\frac{1}{2}\\) (Here this refers to ‘arc slopes’, not precisely the slope at points tangent to the curve.)23 Note the decline in the MRS as she gets more hamburgers (and fewer sodas): this ‘diminishing MRS’ is a common assumption… this may reflect satiation; as she gets more and more hamburgers each one adds incrementally less to her utility (because she grows tired of them.) Careful: it is very easy to get the numerator and denominator wrong in computing the MRS. Find a way to remember this for yourself. Preference for variety/balance This ‘preference for variety’ is thought to hold for most combinations of goods, most of the time, but probably not for all pairings24 With an indifference curve with this shape (‘convex’) any consumption bundle that represents a ‘mixture’ between two equally attractive extremes will be preferred to those extremes.25 E.g., if I like bundles A and D equally, I prefer a bundle of 1/3 of A and 2/3 of D to either A or D.26 the X-axis good as one gives up} Indifference curve map Key principles: IC’s never cross, never slope upwards, and have zero thickness 5.10 Illustrating particular preferences N&amp;S give some examples of preference which violate some of the above assumptions and do not exhibit diminishing MRS. Further notes on the above diagram: Smoke grinders are useless: violates ‘more is better’; this good can be ignored. Houseflies are a bad. (But housefly reduction is a good). Two types of petrol: perfect substitutes (at 1:1); no preference for variety. Left and right shoes are perfect complements in 1:1 proportions; no benefit to more of one without the other; consumed in exact proportions. 5.11 App 2.3: Product positioning in marketing (not covered in lecture, read on your own) Preference for balance? (Convex indifference curves)? If market research suggests a broad group indifferent between A and D (in fig 2.3), they may strictly prefer G \\(\\rightarrow\\) a possible niche for a new profitable product What may be a critique, exception to this logic, e.g., for a particular food? Some suggested answers, others are reasonable… Convex preferences, ‘preferring mixtures’ is a very strong assumption, unlikely to hold everywhere, or for actual mixtures. I may be indifferent between liver and custard, but it doesn’t mean that I prefer liver-flavoured custard, nor even necessarily equal amounts of liver and custard side by side. Producing an ‘intermediate’ attribute may be more costly; it may be easy to make crunchy but low-taste cereal or tasty but low-crunch cereal, but expensive to make a cereal with both attributes. E.g., hard to make a car that is spacious and fast. These issues are decently addressed in the most recent edition 12. Utility/indifference curves: Also a framework for marketing analysis27 5.12 Definitions: Perfect substitutes and complements Perfect substitutes Goods A and B are Perfect Substitutes when an individual’s utility is linear in these goods when she is always willing to trade off A for B at a fixed rate (not necessarily 1 for 1) Perfect complements Goods A and B are Perfect Complements when an individual only gains utility from (more) A if she also consumes a defined (additional) amount of B, and vice-versa These goods are ‘enjoyed only in fixed proportions’. E.g., left and right shoes (1:1) bicycle frames and wheels (1:2) or, perhaps, baking powder and flour (1:40) for someone who only eats soda bread.28 5.13 Choices are subject to constraints You cannot spend more than your (lifetime) income/wealth \\(\\rightarrow\\) budget constraint. Consider the budget constraint given in the figure below. Notes: For example, think ‘food’ and ‘nonfood’. Be careful: it is very easy to get this slope ratio backwards! Budget constraint algebra If I spend all my income (which I should do over a ‘relevant lifetime’), then: Expenditure on X + Expenditure on Y = Income (I) \\[P_X X + P_Y Y = I \\] To see how \\(Y\\) trades off against \\(X\\), rearrange this to: \\[Y = -\\frac{P_X}{P_Y} X + \\frac{I}{P_Y}\\] Intercept: \\(\\frac{I}{P_Y}\\), i.e., amount of Y you can buy if you only buy Y Slope: \\(-\\frac{P_X}{P_Y}\\), i.e., how much Y you must give up to get another unit of X Notes and intuition: The slope \\(-P_X/P_Y\\): How much \\(Y\\) I must sacrifice to get another unit of \\(X\\), expressed as a negative number.29 To get another unit of \\(X\\) it costs me \\(P_xX\\), so the more costly is \\(X\\) the more \\(Y\\) I must give up. For each unit of \\(Y\\) I give up I save \\(P_Y\\), so the more costly is \\(Y\\) the more I can save by giving up 1 unit of it, thus, the less I need to sacrifice of \\(Y\\) to get another unit of \\(X\\). Work on making sure you can calculate the slope and intercept, what they mean, and have intuition for why the slope has this formula. See ‘micro quiz 2.3’) Having trouble understanding the budget constraint computations? There is a great interactive exercise HERE, click on ‘budget constraint’. 5.14 Utility maximization We started with an individual’s preferences, one of the baseline elements of the neoclassical model. Under some conditions these can be described by utility functions, which we depicted graphically as ‘mountains’ with levels sets depicted by indifference curves. So, we have a way of depicting what people prefer, but this doesn’t tell us what people will choose to consume (and firms to produce). We next introduced the second fundamental element of the neoclassical model, constraints, in particular, the budget constraint. We put these together to describe the consumer’s problem: maximizing her utility subject to her budget constraints. this is depicted in figure 2.7 below for the two good case. Imagine that you are this consumer with these preferences and this budget constraint. You can choose any point in the shaded area, as it is on or below your budget constraint. You want to get to the highest indifference curve. Consider: How do we know A is suboptimal (i.e., NOT optimal(? What about B? Points between B and C? We can demonstrate that you will choose point C, yielding utility \\(U_2\\). What is special about point C? It’s the point of tangency between the budget constraint and an indifference curve. It’s also (not a coincidence) the point where the slopes are equal. Slope of budget constraint = slope of indifference curve \\(\\rightleftarrows\\)30 \\[P_X/P_Y = MRS\\] Note that both slopes are negative, so both negative signs cancel out, leaving this condition. Warning: The above is shorthand; recall that the marginal rate of substitution may vary everywhere along an indifference curve (remember the idea of satiation and diminishing MRS). It is a function of the point it is evaluated, i.e., \\(MRS = MRS(X,Y)\\). It is only at the point where the consumer is optimizing that these slopes must be equal.31 At an optimal consumption choice (given above assumptions, see above footnote) Consume all of income (locate on budget line; follows from ‘more is better’) Psychic tradeoff (MRS) equals market tradeoff (\\(P_X/P_Y\\)) Intuition: If I can give up X for Y in the market (buy less X, get more Y) at a certain rate, and the benefit I get from doing this is at a different rate, I can make myself better off. Thus the original point could not have been optimal! Think about this carefully; it is a key method of proving things in economic theory called ‘proof by contradiction’. Example, for intuition Suppose that at the consumption bundle you choose your MRS = 1. To remain indifferent, you would be willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1 soda. Suppose the price of soda is £1 and the price of a burger is £2. \\(\\rightarrow\\) Price ratio: \\(P_S/P_B = 1/2\\) Thus if you buy one less burger you can buy two more sodas. Thus if you give up one burger, you can get one more soda to keep you indifferent plus an additional soda. This means you would be better off; thus the original bundle wasn’t optimal. Practice question: in which direction would you adjust this bundle if the price of a soda was £2 and a hamburger was £1? Explain. More insight: Skip if you like This next bit is fairly mathy. It should be helpful but you can skip over it if you don’t find it so. Recall \\(U=U(X,Y)\\). \\[U_X(X,Y) := MU_X(X,Y)\\] Derivative with respect to X: rate that utility increases if we add a little X, holding Y constant Similarly for \\(MU_Y\\). It turns out the MRS at a point is the ratio of these marginal utilities. MRS: ‘how much Y would I be willing to give up to get a unit of X’? Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each … we can show \\(MRS(X,Y)=\\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\\) Note: The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point – the higher is \\(MU_X\\) – the more Y I am willing to give up to get it. That is why \\(MU_X\\) is in the numerator. The more valuable a bit more Y is at that point – the higher is \\(MU_Y\\) – the less Y I am willing to give up to get a bit more X. That is why \\(MU_Y\\) is in the denominator. Advanced maths: The derivation of the MRS is optional material. The ‘first order change in utility’ (or ‘total differential’) is: \\[ dU = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X}dX + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Y}dY\\] \\[ = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY\\] Where \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X}\\) refers to the partial derivative of U(X,Y) with respect to X, and similarly for Y, i.e., the marginal utility. Essentially, this approximates the total change in utility for very small changes in X and Y. Setting it equal to zero and rearranging it yields the rate, at the margin, one is willing to give up Y for X: \\[dU = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY = 0 \\] \\[\\frac{dY}{dX}=-\\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\\] Adv: This is a simple case of the implicit function theorem, essentially \\(U(X,Y)=c\\) defines an implicit function \\(Y(X)\\), whose slope is the negative of the ratio of the derivatives. Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields more intuition: \\[P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y\\] (at each consumption point X,Y) \\[\\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}.\\] I.e., the same ‘bang for each buck’. Note: If this didn’t hold true and you were spending on both goods, you would be paying ‘more per util’ for one good than the other, and thus should reallocate to that other good. 5.15 Note on ‘corner solutions’ The above applies to any interior solution If you are consuming both goods and optimising, \\(P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y\\) must hold Advanced: This is a ‘necessary but not sufficient condition’, sufficient if there is a diminishing MRS everywhere. But you might consume none of some good (say X): if even with no X, \\(MU_X/P_X&lt;MU_Y/P_Y\\) i.e., the marginal utility of the first unit of X is less than that of Y we will see examples of this (maths and graphically) 32 5.16 App 2.4: ticket scalping Suppose tickets are rationed: one per customer. This constraint (which is additional to the budget constraint) implies lower utility; the individual depicted above would choose A if unconstrained. Here the budget line is not tangent to indifference curve; the slopes are not equal. The individual would be better off buying more tickets, but she cannot. She would be willing to buy an additional ticket at full price (move to point C). Actually, she would be willing to pay more than full price for a second ticket. (See previous final exams and textbook questions asking, e.g., ‘how much would she be willing to pay?’ She could give up up to an additional C-D of goods for ticket 2 and still be as well off. Adv: Tough questions (final exam-worthy): Why would NFL institute this rule? Who benefits? (Maybe poor consumers?) Why do people see scalping as unfair? Is there ever a justification to forbid a transaction between 2 consenting parties? 5.17 App 2.5: What’s a rich uncle’s promise worth? (Read this at home.) Note: Willie would choose point A with his original income, but his uncle paid him $5k to abstain from sinful goods. If he accepts this and only consumes ‘other goods’, this would get him to point B, gaining him \\(U_3\\). But now suppose that his uncle reneged on the promise, so he is at point C. Graphically, how much $ would have been enough to compensate for abstaining?33 5.18 Using the model of choice Why do people spend their money on different things? What do different preferences/indifference curves imply for choices? Note: At this point in the lecture we may move to the powerpoint display, which gives a careful animation of this and several previously mentioned concepts. See the powerpoint here. View in presenter mode. What indicates each persons’ preference for one good over the other? The shape of the indifference curve. The flatter (steeper) the indifference curve the stronger the preference for the good on the Y-axis (X-axis) 5.19 Algebraic/numerical examples Perfect substitutes, but not identical Warning: Thinking caps on. This may be confusing. Consider: are the following ‘perfect substitutes’ for someone who wants caffeine, but has no taste buds? Yes, they are! Recall the definition of perfect substitutes. By ‘perfect substitutes’ we mean pairs of goods for which some amount of one is always valued the same as some amount of the other, and this proportion is always the same. An easy example: I might always be indifferent between three pints of mild ale and two pints of strong ale, if they have the same total alcohol content and I only want to get tipsy. So (for perfect substitutes) buy the one that increases it more per-£. Warning: On the other hand, if goods are not perfect substitutes, margunal utility ratios (thus, marginal rates of substitution) generally depend on consumption levels. Numerical example: \\[U(X,Y)=4X+3Y\\] Rate at which each good (X and Y) increases utility per-unit (derivative) is constant \\(MU_X = 4\\), so every additional unit of X will add four units of utility in this example, no matter what the starting point is. \\(MU_Y = 3\\), … so every unit of Y will add 3 units… So (for perfect substitutes) the consumer will buy the one that increases utility more per-£ Compare \\(MU_X/P_X\\) to \\(MU_Y/P_Y\\) Here, if \\(4/P_X &gt; 3/P_Y\\), then buy X. if \\(4/P_X &lt; 3/P_Y\\), then buy Y (if equal, buy either) Rearranging, if \\(P_X &lt; 4/3 P_Y\\), buy X … etc. ( I sometimes call this the “bang for the buck” condition.) Perfect complements AKA ‘Leontief preferences’ Numerical example: \\[U(X,Y)=min(2X,Y)\\] E.g., where X is bicycle frames and Y bicycle wheels. Warning: this min function seems backwards, but it’s correct. I’ve answered this question many times in office hours and on the forum (have a look). No one believes me at first but in the end they realize that this is the case. However, I will not ask you specifically to get this ‘min’ functional form for perfect complements on an exam. Shortcut: figure out the proportions it will be consumed in determine the cost of ‘one bundle of the combination’ at given prices … then buy as many such bundles as you can afford You should be able to do this without having taken economics. Suppose you were given £100 and asked to spend it to make as many sausages-with-baps as possible. No one can eat a sausage without a bap, nor vice-versa. Sausages come in packs of 4, and baps come in packs of 8. How many packs of each will you buy, supposing both types of packs cost £1 each? Middle-ground A Cobb-Douglas example Recall, as I noted above, that for the “general” rather than extreme cases the marginal rate of substitution at a particular point may vary everywhere, and depends on the amount of each good consumed. Below the “Cobb-Douglas” functional form is one example of such a ‘middle ground’ utility function, expressing neither perfect substitutes and are perfect complements. A simple case of this Cobb-Douglas utility is:34 \\[ U(X,Y)=\\sqrt(XY) \\] Adv note, may help save you computations:35 Amount of Y you’d give up to get a unit of X: \\[MRS(X,Y)= MU_X/MU_Y = Y/X\\] Note: The last equality comes from this particular function; it is not always Y/X. Note also that this is the same as ’the amount of Y you’d need to give up a unit of X Checking your work: is this solution reasonable? The more Y I have, the more I am willing to give up to get a unit of X. This seems reasonable, as it reflects satiation. Adv, maths: This slope is derived through calculus. 36 In general, the marginal rate of substitution (at a point) is the ratio of the marginal utilities at that point.37 Here38 (for this Cobb-Douglas), utility-maximization requires, at optimal choices of X and Y: \\[MRS(X,Y)= Y/X = P_X/P_Y\\] Check that it makes sense: As \\(P_X\\) increases, the right-hand-side (RHS) increases, and so to increase the left-hand-side (LHS) I must increase the units of Y consumed, and thus decrease the units of X consumed. Thus as \\(P_X\\) increases I consume more units of X and less Y, which is what you might expect for a standard case. For any price ratio, you can find the ratio of units of Y &amp; X consumed. Then, if you know the prices and total income \\(I\\), you can calculate the consumption and spending on X and Y Rearranging the optimization condition: \\[Y P_Y = X P_X\\] Question (adv.: What is weird about this condition, for this example?39 Combining this with the budget constraint \\[P_X X + P_Y Y = I\\] we can now solve for amounts of X and Y purchased, as functions of prices and income. Calculations: Rearranging the optimization condition, \\(Y = X P_X/P_Y\\). From the budget constraint, \\(X = (I - P_Y Y)/P_X\\). Substituting in for Y yields \\(X = (I - P_Y(X P_X / P_Y))/P_X = I/P_X - X\\) \\(\\rightarrow 2X = I/P_X \\rightarrow X = I/(2P_X)\\) \\(X P_X = I / 2 \\rightarrow\\) this person always spends half her income on X.40 Advanced shortcut tip:41 5.20 Tutorial problems from chapter 2: see VLE "]
