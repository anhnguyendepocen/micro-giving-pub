## Fifth problem set: Uncertainty, EU, applications {-}


### 'I. The Insurance problem' {-}

Suppose there is a 50-50 chance that a risk averse individual with a current wealth of £20,000 will contract a debilitating disease and suffer a loss of £10,000.

**a)** Calculate the cost of actuarially fair insurance in this situation.

Use a utility-of-income graph to show that the individual will prefer fair insurance against this loss to accepting the gamble uninsured.


\

**Ans:**


- The cost of actuarially fair insurance is equal to the expected monetary value of the loss.
    - Here $E(L) = .50 \times £ 10,000 = £ 5,000$

- This implies that if she buys this insurance it will cost her £5,000, implying that wealth with insurance is always £ 15,000.

- Without insurance, wealth is either £ 10,000 or £ 20,000, each with 50 percent probability.
    - The individual will prefer actuarially fair insurance because the variability of wealth is lower, while the expected monetary value is the same, as shown in the graph, and she has diminishing marginal utility of income.
    - This is shown in the graph below (compare $u_a$ and $u_b$)

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/util_insur_ps6.png")
```

Thus the person would purchase such a policy.

`r format_with_col("Note that in the graph above, because there is an equal probability of 10k or 20k, the point 15k is half the distance between 10K and 20K. Similarly, $u_a$ is half the distance between u(10) and u(10). The slope of the diagonal line tells us the rate at which the expected utility increases as we increase the probability of the higher outcome. It is simply linear as the expected utility calculation is also linear.","gray")`

**b)** Suppose two types of insurance policies were available: 1. A fair policy covering the complete loss and 2. A fair policy covering only half of any loss incurred.

\

Calculate the cost of the second type of policy and show that the individual will generally regard it as inferior to the first.

The cost of the second policy is £ 2,500. Now, if this individual buys policy 2, he or she will (again) have an equal chance of being well or ill.

If she stays healthy her remaining  wealth (in £) is 20000-2500= 17500 (her original wealth minus the cost of the policy.)

If she  falls ill  her remaining  wealth (in £) is $20,000 - 2500- 10,000 +5000 = 12,500$,

i.e., her original wealth (20k) minus the cost of the policy (2500) minus her loss from illness (10,000) plus her reimbursement for half of this cost (5000).

This partial insurance is superior to no insurance but inferior to complete insurance as shown in the figure below.

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/util_insur_ps6b_partial.png")
```

Notice in this figure that $u_b>u_c>u_a$

**(Extension to B):** Suppose this person's realised (VnM, 'little-u') utility function $u = V^{1/3}$.

What is the maximum amount they would be willing to pay for the full insurance?

\
\

**Ans:**

To solve the first question we need to solve for her utility (EU) under no insurance. We then "invert" this to find the amount of certain income she would need to gain the same utility as this.  In other words, returning to the first diagram, we need to figure out exactly what income yields utility $u_a$, the point of that big blue dot in the first diagram (somewhere between 10k and 15k).

We then know that she would be willing to pay a price that would leave her with this income for sure, i.e., where 20k minus this price leaves her with such an income.

Computing expected utility without insurance, for this VnM utility function:

$u_a = \frac{1}{2}  V(10,000) + \frac{1}{2}  V(20,000) = \frac{1}{2}(10,000^{\frac{1}{3}}+20,000^{\frac{1}{3}}) \approx 24.35$

 What level of 'certain income'  leaves  her with this same utility? Level $y_a$ where $u(y_a)=y_a^{1/3} = u_a$ or $y_a=u_a^3$. Cubing the above  calculated $u_a$:

$y_a= \frac{1}{2}(10,000^{\frac{1}{3}}+20,000^{\frac{1}{3}})^3 \approx 14,437.6$

This is (approximately) the amount of certain income she needs to be left with after purchasing full insurance to make it just worthwhile doing.

Thus she is willing to pay up to (approximately) 20000-14437 =5,563 pounds for the full insurance.
