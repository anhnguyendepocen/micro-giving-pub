## Profit maximisation and supply - coverage

- NS: Ch 8
- T1:07a-07b

- 8.1 The nature of firms (why they exist, goals, etc)
- 8.2 Profit maximisation
- 8.3 Marginal revenue

NOTE: includes trivial perfect competition case and 'monopoly' case

- 8.4 Marginal revenue curve
- 8.5 Supply decisions of a price-taking firm

\

*Key goals of this chunk*

1. Understand the economist's definition(s) of a firm, and its goals
1. Learn what 'marginal revenue' is
- (and why it is less than the market price for a firm facing downward sloping demand)
- but equal to the market price for a price-taking firm
1. Understand the price and output choice (condition) for a price-taking firm
- and a firm's shut-down/entry decision
- and what *is* a 'price-taking firm'?

\


**Context**

- We considered production functions and cost ...


<br> <br> \bigskip

*Now:* what **output** should the firm set to maximise profits?

<br> <br> \bigskip

*(Next: the consequences of this for the market)*

## Important aside: What are 'firms' and why do they exist?

Standard (classical) economics definition: A *firm* is an entity that transforms inputs into outputs.

<br> <br> \bigskip


We assume a firm's goal is to maximise profit.

```{block2,  type='digression'}

Aside...

Ronald Coase asked the question "Why do large entities called 'firms' exist?"


They engage in many activities and own many assets

They often use 'command and control' within firms rather than markets

This spawned a large literature on the 'theory of the firm' emphasizing things like incomplete contracts, hold-up, relationship specific assets, lobbying costs, and more.

```



### Marginal revenue {-}

Marginal revenue
:     The additional gross income a firm gains from increasing the quantity it supplies by one unit


Remember, given its choice of production the firm will always choose the highest price at which it can sell all the units it has produced.

<br> <br> \bigskip


- It can sell an additional unit at some price
- But it may have to reduce prices on *all* units to do this (more on this later)



### MR for firm facing 'downward-sloping demand'^[See example in table 1 in text.] {-}


Assume it's charging a single price to all consumers.

$\rightarrow$ It can sell more only by reducing price on *all units*

E.g., it can sell 51 units rather than 50 by reducing price from £1 to £0.99

The marginal revenue is less than market price here *because*
- Get (new) market price for additional unit $\rightarrow$ + £0.99
- But lose £0.01 on all previous 50 units $\rightarrow$ - £0.50
- So MR is £0.49

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/Mrillustrated.png")
```

\

**MR curves be like:**

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='65%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/mrcurve.png")
```


`r format_with_col("Q: Why might MR curves typically decrease in Q?","blue")`^[ Ans: Demand curves slope down, so less revenue for each additional unit. \
 Also, the *impact* of the reduced price is greater because the more we sell the more units this affects.]


\

### MR for a 'price-taking' firm {-}

Under 'perfect competition' (which we will describe soon), each firm is a 'price-taker'

Each firm:

- gets market price P for each additional unit
- the firm is small, so its output has (virtually) no impact on P ^[The NS text gives a good illustration and examples of why it is fine to assume that a small producer's output has no impact on price]
    - (More on this later)



<br> <br> \bigskip

*Thus its marginal revenue is constant at $P$*!


`r format_with_col("Note that for such a firm, the total revenue curve will be a straight line ... 'double quantity and you double revenue'","gray")`


\

## Profit-maximisation

- If operating, set optimal output $q^*$
- Under standard assumed conditions


`r format_with_col("Advanced footnote","RawSienna")`^[ There are specific conditions for the existence of a 'unique maximum-profit quantity'. E.g., this will be ensured by everywher- decreasing marginal revenue and increasing or nondecreasing marginal costs]

- ... profits are maximised at the unique $q^*$ such that $MR=MC$


<br> <br> \bigskip


This holds *for all types of firms*

- For firms with market power ('price-setters') the MR takes into account the downward sloping demand curve.

- For a price-taker, setting $MR(q)=MC(q)$ means setting $P=MC(q)$, because $P=MR(q)$


\textcolor{blue}{Q:  Why? Suppose actual output was greater or less than q*.
Explain what is true about marginal profits as output increases or decreases.}^[Ans:
if q>q*, MR, which is decreasing in q, will be below MC.
Firm can do better if it reduces q somewhat-- cost decrease will be larger than revenue decrease.
 If $q<q^{\ast}$, $MR<MC$ -- better to increase q and revenue increases more than costs]

\

**Consider a firm with market power:**


The firm wants to maximise profit. This means making the vertical distance between the revenue and cost curves as large as possible. \
If the curves had differing slopes, profits could be increased by adjusting output in the direction in which the curves diverged. (Consider this starting from points $q_1$ or $q_2$ on the curves below.)

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/fig8-1.png")
```



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/monopmcmr.png")

```



## MR=mc condition for a price-taking firm

$$MR(q) = P$$ ... because of price-taking

Notice in the diagram below that the profits---the distance between total revenue (TC) and total costs (TC) is maximised at the quantity $q$ where $MR(q)=mc(q)$, i.e., where $P=mc(q)$.

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/mcmr_tc_tr.png")

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='2in', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

## Supply decisions of a price-taking firm

**Price-taking firms:** *How much should they charge?*

They can sell all the output they and at market price P*. Will price at P*. We can see this is the case by considering points *other than this* and noting that these are always *worse* (for the firm):

- Set p<P* $\rightarrow$  Sell same amount, earn less. Not smart!

-  Set p>P* $\rightarrow$ Sell no units. Bad move!


\

**Price-taking firms** *How much should they produce?*


One standard assumption is that $MC(0)<P^*$,  $MC(q)$ increasing in q (assumed)
(... perhaps a more reasonable assumption is that there is at least some region for which AVC< $P^*$).

Thus, the firm should choose q for which $MC(q) = P^*$

$\rightarrow$  'Perfectly competitive firms price at marginal cost'

\

But if P* is below your average cost for *any possible* output q you must shut down!

- If it's below '(short run) average variable costs', shut down right away; each unit you produce adds to your loss!

- If it's below your (long-run) average cost, shut down before incurring any more fixed costs, you will never be able to produce at a profit!

*NOTE:* I am not focusing on the distinction between the short and long run cost curves in this module
