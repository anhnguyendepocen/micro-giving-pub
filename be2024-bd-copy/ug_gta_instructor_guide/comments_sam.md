# Comments for Sam:

Good clear handwriting and drawing (unlike me)

Good that you went around to see people's work, but it's not clear that they knew to bring work

You don't need to plot *all* of the points

May be better to print out the problem set (with notes to instructor). But it was also good that you projected the question on the board.

You may be able to get students to *tell* slope calculation ... engage them
