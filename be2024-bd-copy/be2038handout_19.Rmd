## Demand functions

Previously, we considered how consumption choices determined by utility functions/indifference curves and budget constraints.  We can now consider how an individual's choice of a good  varies with  each element of her budget constraint:  for income and the price of each good.

We will refer to her 'quantity demanded of good X' function (or more simply, her 'demand function') as follows:


<br> <br> \bigskip

$$Quantity \: of \: X \: demanded = d_x(P_X, P_Y, I; preferences)$$


***

### Homogeneity {-}

Homogenous (of degree zero) (demand) function
:      A function whose outcome value does not change when *all* arguments are changed *proportionally* is *homogenous of degree zero*


<br> <br> \bigskip

$d_X(P_X,P_Y,I)$ is homogenous of degree zero in its arguments.


<br> <br> \bigskip


Multiply all prices and income by the same amount, and the *budget constraint is unchanged.*  Thus ( as preferences have not changed) consumption choices should not change either.

-  E.g., the budget constraint $P_X X + P_Y Y = I$ is the same as the budget constraint $2P_X X + 2P_Y Y = 2I$


*Intuition for this:* Graphically, the budget line and indifference curves are unchanged, so her optimization problem  is identical to the optimization problem before. The point of tangency between  an indifference curve and her budget line is the same as before.

Consider, if your income, as well as prices, were stated in pennies rather than pounds (e.g., 5 million pennies rather than £50,000), would your choices change?^[Of course not!  At least they 'should' not change;  your optimal choices would not change.  Perhaps in some specific context the way the problem is framed may affect people's choices, but that is  not what is being asked here.  Furthermore, we are considering 'normative' economics in the sense of 'what would rational optimizing agents do'?]

This relates to the puzzle of 'why should monetary policy and inflation have any real effect?'


## Response to income changes

Q:  What happens to the quantity purchased of some good as your income increases?

A: Depends on whether the good is normal or inferior.

\

(Whether it is normal or inferior depends on your preferences and the change in the slope of the indifference curves with higher income/utility, as we see below.)


<br> <br> \bigskip

Normal good
:     A good that is bought in *greater* quantities as income increases.

Inferior good
:     A good that is bought in *smaller* quantities as income increases.

 knitr::include_graphics("inferiorgood.png")
```


*Consider:* Here we see more income $\rightarrow$ less expenditure on Z! (Not just 'a lesser share' but actually *less*.)

This is because the *shape* of the indifference curves changes at higher incomes in this example.
When people have a lot to spend, they want to spend it on Y and not on Z. (Again *in this example*, not in general.)
Consider, if you won the lottery how much pot noodle would you buy? Pot noodle may be like good Z  in this example.

Thinking in 3d: 'as you walk up this hill, its ridge gradually moves to the west'

*Notes:* Adv: To be precise, this is *not* about wealthy people being different than poor people
nor that their taste 'changes' when they become wealthy.
We are considering the same person with higher income,
and thus the potential to choose a different bundle of goods.
Empirically, these are hard to distinguish, however.

## Substitution and income effects from a fall (or rise) in price

What happens to the quantity purchased of some good when the price of the good falls or rises?

\

*This changes both an intercept and a slope.*\

The new utility-maximizing choice is on *another* indifference curve and it is a point on that curve with a different MRS.

Substitution effect ('Hicksian')
:     The effect on consumption due to a change in price 'holding real income or utility constant.'

Income effect (of a price change)
:     The remaining effect on consumption; due to the change in purchasing power and achievable utility caused by a change in price.

Note that this is *conceptual*: we never *actually* observe either of these effects alone; we always observe the net effect of both.

[comment]: <> (2024BB)

`r format_with_col("Advanced footnote","RawSienna")`^[This topic is more nuanced and complicated than we will cover in the main content of this module. \
To fully cover this, we would have to consider the theoretical concept of a 'compensated' aka 'Hicksian' demand curve, \
where income is adjusted to hold utility constant while price ratios change. \
This also allows us to consider 'net versus gross' substitution, and 'equivalent vs compensating variation'. \
More advanced economics modules will cover this extensively and rigorously.]

[comment]: <> (2024EE)

***

Some things to remember and 'remember why':

- The \underline{substitution effect} *always* goes in the opposite direction as the price change

- The \underline{income effect} goes in the opposite direction as the price change for a normal good

- ... But the income effect goes in the *same* direction as the price change for an inferior good

    - Thus the substitution and income effects go in the same direction for a normal good,

    - ... and they go in different directions for an inferior good.

    - For an inferior good the net effect is unknown, but usually the substitution effect dominates (but see Giffen goods below)

***

**Read on your own (from NS), know:**

- Numerical example of response to price change
- The relative importance of substitution effects for most goods
- Substitution and income effects for inferior goods

## Different substitution effects of a price change

The substitution effect of a price change will depend on the utility function, i.e., on the curvature of the indifference curves at the relevant point.


- Perfect complements: There is no substitution effect, only an income effect of a price change.

- Perfect substitutes: There may be a large substitution effect -- a price change may cause a complete switch from one good (or set of goods) to another. On the other hand there may be no substitution effect for a 'small' change in price... see examples.

- In-between utility functions: depends on curvature of indifference curve at the relevant point.

*Util-max s.t. constraints* $\rightarrow$


**Understand real-world issues:**

1. A 'Fixed-basket' consumer price index (CPI) may overstate inflation

2. The lump-sum principle,  the distortion of taxation




**Fundamental concepts, useful for business \& policy:**

1. Goods may be 'substitutes' or 'complements' for one another

2. How can we consider/compute the  *Consumer surplus* from a transaction?



**Derive**

- An *individual's* demand curve from her utility function

- The *Market* demand curve (from individual demand curves)

    - `r format_with_col("What causes *shifts* in either?","gray")`

<br> <br> \bigskip

## App 3.2: The CPI and its biases

The government (and many others) want to know 'how much less (or more) is  a pound this year than a pound in the past?'
One of the most prominent measures of this is the "consumer price index (CPI)."

The is a *very* important number: It is used for monetary policy ('inflation targeting') and for targeting many salaries and benefits. For example, my union is always raising the complaint that salaries have not risen  in line with inflation. (But  don't worry, student fees have.)

Getting this number substantially and consistently wrong  can lead to huge problems;  people may be let into poverty or the government may be led into default. However, it is hard to get this measure right.  Using the classical economics framework, we can consider what this means.


The UK uses a similar CPI measure to the USA (a change from the 'RPI' in 2003, although RPI is still used for some things). The Bank of England targets a 2\% increase in the CPI per year.^[Something to know: what has been the  inflation rate in recent years? This is an example of 'market and industry knowledge'  that employers value. True, you can look this stuff up,  but having a general sense of these things rolling around in your brain will  ground your thinking.  As an analogy,  suppose you were a mariner navigating the seven seas and you had to go online every time to remember which direction was North or South.}


*But does the CPI overstate the rate of inflation?*

It is based on a 'typical market basket' (UK: of 700 different goods and services, excluding housing, updated yearly).


**1982 vs 2019 two-good example**

We can consider this with a minimal example, using only our two favourite goods, x and y.

Suppose in 1982 the "average household" consumed $x_{82}$  units of good x and $y_{82}$ units of good y.
The  prices were $p^x_{82}$ and $p^y_{82}$ for each of these, respectively.

Now in 2019 the average household consume $x_{19}$  units of good x and $y_{19}$ units of good y.
The prices are $p^x_{19}$ and $p^y_{18}$ for each of these, respectively.

\

The expenditure (in pounds) in 1982 was thus $b_{82}$:

$$b_{82}=p^x_{82}x_{82}+p^y_{82}y_{82}$$

How much would it cost to consume the "average 1982" basket today (2019),  with today's prices? ... This is defined as $b_{19}$:

$$b_{19}=p^x_{19}x_{82}+p^y_{19}y_{82}$$


The "regular" CPI  will simply take the ratio  of these two numbers:

$$cpi_{19}=\frac{b_{19}}{b_{82}}$$


An unadjusted (Fixed-basket) CPI 'claims' you need $I'$ to be as well off in 2019. I.e., to buy *the exact same basket*, including vinyl records.\ But, as seen in the figure below, by substituting you could be as well off with the lower level of income $I''$\ (And income $I'$ would actually make you *better* off).

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("cpi_bias.png")
```

<br> <br> \bigskip

In fact, in setting policy, the basket *is* adjusted yearly, based on a survey of consumers' spending.\ But even this is not necessarily the *right* adjustment,\ as consumers may be attaining higher or lower utility from these changes.\ The right adjustment depends on the consumers' utility functions, which are unobservable.

## The Lump-Sum Principle

Have you seen this?


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("ukwindows.jpg")
```

\textcolor{gray}{1696: An Act for granting to His Majesty several Rates or Duties upon Houses for making good the Deficiency of the clipped Money...
Properties with between ten and twenty windows paid an extra four shillings (£24.79 in 2016), and those above twenty windows paid an extra eight shillings (£49.57 in 2016).} <\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_tax}>

Consider the 'least efficient tax': Suppose the UK government imposes a tax on all windows above 4 per house.\

*Suppose all UK residents put bricks over their excess windows.* The government raises no revenue but people are certainly worse off.

***

What's going on here?

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("tudoroverhang.jpg")
```

^[Note: 'Taxes based on ground-floor area' are mentioned throughout the web, but I couldn't find an authoritative reference to this. If anyone finds one, please let me know!]



The social cost (deadweight loss, i.e., 'DWL') of taxation is greater the more taxes change 'compensated' behaviour (via the substitution effect)^[Why 'compensated' behavior?  Essentially, because taxes in general will always leave people with less effective income, causing them to change their consumption choices to reflect the new, lower indifference curves. What matters for the deadweight loss is how the taxes change their behavior at this new lower-income state. This is a fundamental issue in Public Finance/taxation.]

The most efficient tax:

- raises the most revenue for a given utility loss

- reduces utility the least for a given revenue

- ... is a 'lump-sum tax': same tax no matter what you do (including work/leisure!)

This is a rationale for the poll tax, the proposed tax that brought down Margaret Thatcher's government

\


A common measure of the burden: 'amount a person would be willing to pay to avoid tax', for a given revenue raised

Todo: explain this here

-->

*A step-by-step illustration of this is given in the [PowerPoint file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qhsl6qey0wjcfe5/utility_demand_supplement.pptx?dl=0) under 'Lump sum principle'.

Key to understanding the above example illustration: how do we see that the blue and red dot both *raise the same revenue*?

You could also compute these tax revenues algebraically and see they are the same (see footnote in NS textbook), but it is better to gain intuitive insight.

The revenue can be seen as the distance on the vertical axis, representing the value in terms of Y at the pre-tax price ratio.

This holds whether we measure it in terms of either commodity -- you just have to pick one.

The tax revenue is the difference between the individual's income and the amount he consumes; both measured in terms of one commodity only,
according to the *actual opportunity cost* of that commodity, not measured with the 'after tax price'.


Note...^[This illustration is a single example; to see that this holds generally, take Public Economics. There are some interesting and surprising results. A caveat: If you *can't* tax one good (e.g., leisure)\
 you *don't* want to tax all other goods equally.\
 In general, you want to tax goods that distort behaviour less overall.]

**Read on your own, know:**

The potential inefficiency of in-kind programmes and subsidies (App 3.3)^[In the UK, the 'welfare wall' is usually referred to as the 'benefits trap' or 'unemployment trap'. This is something successive governments have tried to remedy, recently, with the 'Universal Credit'.]

`r format_with_col("Potential 'expansive' exam question: Consider the *benefits* of in-kind programmes rather than cash transfers.","blue")`




## Changes in the Price of Another Good

\textcolor{gray}{Note:  In the previous 2-good diagrams the impact of the change in $P_X$ on $Y$ was mechanical.
With a new budget constraint and a new $X$ $\rightarrow$, the individual needed to spend the remainder on $Y$. If expenditure on one good went up, expenditure on the other good must have gone down, and vice/versa.  With 3 or more goods, this need not hold.}

Complements
:     If a rise in $P_X$ leads the quantity demanded of Y, $d_Y$, to decrease (and vice-versa), then goods Y and X are (gross) *complements* to one another.

*How to remember:* 'complements' go together, so the quantity-demanded response to a price change is the same for both goods
 -- the opposite direction as the price change (unless Giffen).

<br> <br> \bigskip

Substitutes
:     If a rise in $P_X$ leads $d_Y$ to increase (and vice versa), then goods Y and X are (gross) *substitutes* to one another.


A tip on how to remember this:

'Substitutes' are competing to meet the same desires, so when you buy more of one, you tend to buy less of the other.\
Thus the quantity demanded response to a price change go in opposite directions for the two goods\
Thus, as quantity-demanded for good A typically goes in the *opposite* direction as the price of A\
... quantity demanded for a substitute good B will go in the *same* direction as the price of A.^[`r format_with_col("Adv:","RawSienna")` These 'cross-price effects' include both *substitution* and *income* effects. (See micro quiz 3.3).]


## Individual demand curves

- Quantity of X demanded

<br> <br> \bigskip

$$d_X(P_X,P_Y,I; \: preferences)$$

<br> <br> \bigskip

- 'Individual demand curve': depicts how the amount of a good an *individual* buys responds to that good's price

How do we derive this (graphically)?


We can 'map it out' by increasing $P_X$ $\rightarrow$ budget constraint shifts in $\rightarrow$.
In each case we find new point of tangency with indifference curve. We plot this in the example below (better illustrated in the PowerPoint, perhaps.)

## Shifts in an individual's demand curve

`r format_with_col("Q:  What might cause the demand curve for a product to shift (inward or outward)?","blue")`


*Not:*

- *Not* 'a change in the price of that good'.
- *Not* a shift in the supply curve.

*Yes:*

- Change in price of complements or substitutes for that good
- Change in income
- Perhaps: Change in consumer's information, preferences,^[Note: Economists disagree as to how to consider or model changes in preferences] or other factors (weather, etc).

`r format_with_col(" I'm sure you can see how I could write a multiple-choice question about this.","gray")`

Know the difference between shifts in a shift in a demand (or supply) curve and movements along a demand curve, and the terminology.\
This will almost surely be on one of the exams in some form, see e.g., micro quiz 3.4\

- Hint: I suggest you avoid referring to 'supply and demand'; refer to either 'supply and demand *curves*' or 'quantity demanded or supplied'.

## Consumer surplus

Consumer surplus
:     The extra value individuals receive from consuming a good over what they pay for it.

<br> <br> \bigskip

- What people would be willing to pay for the *right* to consume a good *at its current price* rather than not being able to buy it at all.^[In other words, if you said to a consumer 'this product will stop being produced/offered  unless you pay us enough money',  this is the maximum amount the consumer would be will be willing to pay to keep the product on the market,  at its current price.]

- The area between the demand curve and the market price

- A measure of consumer welfare, useful for policy analysis

```


`r format_with_col("Advanced maths note","RawSienna")`^[With a linear demand curve this is a triangle, which has an area that is easy to compute. More generally, this is a `definite integral'.]

Also...^[This can be applied to the individual or market demand curve to obtain individual or total consumer surplus (although there are some technical issues with the latter).]



Also, 'introducing a new good...'^[This concept can also be applied to measuring the value added by the introduction of a new good (see Application 3.4). This is useful to know for policy, particular in formulating subsidies for R\&D and in adjusting the CPI. It also could be used to compute damages in court cases where a firm is accused of stifling innovation.]

:     The total quantity of a good or service demanded by all potential buyers

- Sum the individual quantities demanded (at a given price)

Some of our previous results about individual demand also hold for market demand, while others do not, or only if we make restrictive assumptions

## Shifts in the Market Demand Curve

- Similar things that cause individual demand curve shifts
    - Increases in overall income (for normal goods)
    - Reduced prices of complements, increased price of substitutes

`r format_with_col("However, the aggregate income does not have a single effect; it cannot be easily reduced to a single variable here.

## Elasticities

`r format_with_col(" This is a fundamental mathematics concept that comes from Physics;  it's not just for Economics.","gray")`

- How to measure and compare the extent to which one thing responds to another?
- E.g., which is 'larger'?:
    - the change in quantity demanded of oranges when the price of oranges rises or
    - the change in quantity demanded of apple juice when the price of apple juice rises?

`r format_with_col("(Or the response to changes in the price of a related good, or to income.)","gray")`

- Difficulty: These things are measured in different *units* and the prices have different starting values.

<br> <br> \bigskip

Elasticity: the measure of the \% change in one variable brought about by a 1\% change in another variable.

- a *unitless* measure; will be the same no matter how these variables are measured.

`r format_with_col("Think of *responsiveness* when talking about elasticity. Actually it's a measure from physics having to do with rubber bands, they tell me.","gray")`

`r format_with_col("Advanced footnote","RawSienna")`^[Strictly speaking we are talking about the limit of these responses, i.e., derivatives. \
  The elasticity is basically the derivative of $ln(y)$ with respect to $ln(x)$; useful to know if you want to run a regression computing an elasticity, or if you want to interpret such a regression.]

<br> <br> \bigskip

- If a 5\% fall in the price of oranges typically results in a 10\% increase in quantity bought,
- we say that each percent fall in the price of oranges leads to an increase in sales of about 2 percent.
- I.e., the ‘‘elasticity’’ of orange sales with respect to price is about 2,

*Note that elasticities may not be constant*; they may depend on the starting point;  e.g., linear demand implies a different price elasticity at each point.


## Price elasticity of demand

Price elasticity of demand:
$$e_{Q_d,p} = \frac{percent \ change \ in \ Q_d}{percent \ change \ in \ p} $$
$$  = \frac{\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}/\frac{\Delta p}{p}$$

- Should always be negative (except for Giffen goods)
- A unitless measure related to the slope of the demand curve
- *Very* important for price-setting firms (more on this later)

> 'The last time we had to increase prices (which was in 2010 when cotton prices soared) we estimated that price elasticity was around 1.1.

Properties of price elasticity of demand:

- Goods with many close substitutes at a similar price will be highly elastic
- ... with few substitutes ...  inelastic
- Typically: more elastic in the *long run* than the short run. `r format_with_col("Q : why?","blue")`^[Ans: Over time, consumers can adjust to price changes by changing their consumption patterns. E.g., if petrol gets more expensive I can switch to a hybrid or electric car, or a bicycle.]

We refer to price elasticities with the following terminology:

$e_{Q,p}$ | $abs(e_{Q,p})$ | Term         |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| $< -1$    | $>1$        | Elastic      |
| $= -1$    | $=1$        | Unit Elastic |
| $> -1$    | $<1$        | Inelastic    |

Consider an individual's  expenditure on a product.

The total expenditure (the firm's revenue from this): price $\times$ quantity


[comment]: <> (2024BB)

By taking the *total differential* of this (you don't need to), and recalling the 'multiplication rule' of derivatives...

[comment]: <> (2024EE)

We have that for *small changes* in price, the percent *change* in total expenditure is:

    - pct change price $+$ pct *change* quantity

As $e_{Q,P}$ tells you the percent change in quantity for each (small) percentage change in price, we can use this to determine the change in expenditure for a small change in price.

*Considering very small increases in a good's price:*

-   If the (individual's) demand is *price-elastic*,  quantity will decrease by a *larger* percentage than price increased.  Thus her expenditure (on this good) will *decline*.

-   If the (individual's) demand is *price-inelastic*,  quantity will decrease by a *smaller* percentage than price increased.  Thus her expenditure (on this good) will *increase *.

-   If the (individual's) demand is *unit-elastic* (with respect to price),  quantity will decrease by a *the same* percentage as price increased.  Thus her expenditure (on this good) will *be unchanged*.

<br> <br> \bigskip



#### Example and (slightly more advanced) algebra... {-}

If price rises by 20\% and quantity demanded falls by 20\% what happens to revenue?
Suppose p=10 and q=10 so TR=100. Then when p=12 and q=8 TR=96. Huh? Price increased by 20\% and quantity decreased by 20\% so shouldn't TR be unchanged?  No! This only works for small changes.

TR is unchanged when p*q stays the same. With a change in each $\delta p$ and $\delta q$, the new revenue is

$(p+\delta p)(q+\delta q) = pq+\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q$.

This is the same as before if $pq=pq+\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q$, i.e., if

$\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q=0$, i.e., if

$\delta p q + \delta p \delta q =-\delta q p$, i.e., if

$\delta p q/p + \delta p \delta q/p =-\delta q$, i.e., if

$\delta p/ \delta q (q/p) + \delta p /p =-1$, i.e., if

$-e_p +  \delta p /p = -1$

In the limit, as  $\delta p$ goes to zero, this gives us that 'unit elasticity means a small change in quantity leads to no change in revenue.'


`r format_with_col("Q: Suppose a firm is setting its price and selling to only one individual , and facing no  competitors. It should basically never want to set its price at a point where demand is inelastic. Why not?","blue")`^[Ans: If it were at such a point, it could raise its price and its revenue would increase and costs would decline \
 (because it would be selling fewer products but for greater total revenue.) \
 A caveat is that it might do this for a long term strategic advantage; e.g., to gain customer loyalty and market share, intending to take its profits later.  we come back to a related point later in the context of monopoly pricing.]

[Prof. Muellbauer letter to FT](https://www.ft.com/content/4ea79d96-a4d6-11e5-a91e-162b86790c58)

> Sir, Professor Gordon Gemmill (Letters, December 14), surprisingly for a trained economist, assumes an income elasticity of demand of zero for housing: that is, that people do not demand more and better housing as they become richer. Nowhere in the world is this the case! My own empirical work demonstrates that around two-thirds of the rise in UK house prices, corrected for general inflation, since 1980 is because supply is not keeping up with income and population growth. Other drivers do exist ... The price effects of extra supply take time to build up. I agree on that. But just imagine what would happen if we did nothing more than we are now doing: population and income growth would drive prices even higher even though we already hold the record for rises in house prices since 1970 among the group of seven leading high-income countries. We need to build far more housing, in the right locations. And we need to start now.

## Lecture  (30 min) - Production and costs (brief treatment: coverage)


<!---
Todo: desperately need motivation here
-->

`r format_with_col("This year","red")` we only briefly cover the production function, inputs, and the firm's cost structure.


<br> <br> \bigskip

Key issues are highlighted on the next slides, and in the handouts.

I'm giving you the 'basic idea' so we can continue the *story.*


<br> <br> \bigskip

Recommendation: Read the following parts of NS Text ch 6-7; you can skip the parts not mentioned and skip the applications

Ch 6:

- Production function (basic idea; you can skip isoquant maps and RTS if you like)

- Returns to scale (!)

- Basic cost concepts (!)

- Skim 'Cost minimising input choice' (approximate understanding is OK)

- Cost curves (!)


... to help understand the key concepts below

***

## The Firm's Production function

- A production function is a mathematical relationship between inputs (capital, labour, materials, etc.) and outputs.

<br> <br> \bigskip

$$q = f( K, L, M, ...)$$


$$q = f(K, L)$$


- e.g., $q =2L^{1/3}K^{2/3}$

- Given its production choice, the firm tries to produce it at the minimum cost
    - This resembles a consumer maximizing utility subject to budget constraints^[A major difference: a firm *also* chooses the *level* of output, while the consumer has a fixed budget constraint ... we return to the firm in later sections.]


<!---
Todo: give an example here... consider 'how much labour will the firm hire'? Maybe something about automation and a guaranteed living wage?
-->

<br> <br> \bigskip


Typically, a particular quantity ($q$) could be produced with several different combinations of inputs.

*Which combination will the firm choose?*


$$q = f(k,l,...)$$


**Main point**: Whatever $q$ it wants to produce, the firm uses the *minimum cost combination of inputs*!

It chooses inputs to get the best 'bang for the buck';


$\rightarrow$ where the input mix is optimal, each input yields the same *marginal product per £*


<!---
Todo (future): R content estimating this?
-->

<br> <br> \bigskip


`r format_with_col("This is very similar to the consumer optimization we discussed. For a given total input cost, the firm wants to produce as much as possible. A better way of thinking about this is that for a given production, the firm wants to incur as low a cost as possible. However, there is no 'hard budget constraint' as in the consumer optimisation case. The firm's output choice will be chosen to maximise it's profit, with no constraints other than 'non-negativity. ","gray")`

`r format_with_col(" I'm not expecting you to know this input-choice optimisation in detail. I just wanted you to have a general sense of it as it helps us see how the model fits together.","gray")`

[comment]: <> (2024EE)

***

<!---
Todo: give more explanation here
-->

Optimisation (given a production function and input prices)...

yields a (minimum) cost for every output $q$ a firm chooses to produce.


<br> <br> \bigskip


Total cost function: $c(q)$ or $TC(q)$.


**Total costs** are fixed costs plus variable costs

- **Fixed costs:** must incur to produce even the first unit (e.g., hire factory space)

- **Variable costs:** increase as one produces more units


***


**Marginal cost** $MC(q)=c'(q)$: rate that costs increase in quantity; derivative of cost function

- cost of producing one additional unit (given you already produced q units)



<br> <br> \bigskip


- **'Average cost'** $AC=c(q)/q$: the production cost per unit produced


`r format_with_col("Average costs are also the total ‘rise over run’ for the TC curve at a given quantity as the firm optimally chooses its inputs.","gray")`

Average costs (for a firm) may be increasing or decreasing in quantity


<br> <br> \bigskip


- Increasing average costs $\leftrightarrow$ Decreasing returns to scale


- Decreasing average costs $\leftrightarrow$ Increasing returns to scale


- Constant average costs $\leftrightarrow$ Constant returns to scale


<br> <br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("Consider: why/when would we expect DRS/IRS/CRS?","blue")` (We discuss this [further below](##IRS-DRS-reasons).)


***

The shape of the marginal cost curve depends on the production function

- Constant returns to scale: constant MC (and no FC)

- Decreasing returns to scale: increasing MC

- Increasing returns to scale: decreasing MC (and/or constant FC)

## Returns to scale

*Are bigger firms always more efficient? Do things get cheaper to produce the more we produce?*


If so, what limits the size of firms? I.e., why don't we see only one firm in each industry?

Returns to scale
:     The rate at which output increases in response to a proportional increase in *all* inputs.


***

Constant returns to scale (CRS)
:     If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor equal to X.

- E.g., doubling all inputs (labour, capital, land, etc) means exactly doubling all outputs


<br> <br> \bigskip



Increasing returns to scale (IRS)
:     If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor greater than X.



Decreasing returns to scale (DRS)
:     If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor less than X.


***

### Arguments/reasons for scale (dis)economies {#IRS-DRS-reasons} {-}

**IRS**

- Fixed costs (incorporation, buildings, management, planning, R\&D) spread over more units
- Should always be able to at least 'double everything' and produce twice as much? (so at least CRS)
- Scale allows specialisation




**DRS**

- Limited resources in whole (or local) economy; costs begin to rise
- Managerial issues and coordination problems, bigger 'centre' to lobby for favours
    - (See 'theories of the firm')
- Harder to give incentives to top manager/CEO?
    - Larger firm $\rightarrow$ harder to make CEO liable for losses


`r format_with_col("Advanced footnote","RawSienna")`^[ I think the first point is valid, but it doesn't suggest that 2 firms would be more efficient than 1; these DRS would set in as a function of  *total* output, not a single firm's output. The second and third arguments are complicated and perhaps harder to justify. The case for DRS is unproven, IMHO]

\textcolor{gray}{Mock exam question:
Give one reason why production may exhibit 'increasing returns to scale' and one reason why it may have 'decreasing returns to scale'.}




## Types of costs ('Basic cost concepts')


Fixed costs (FC)
:     Costs that must be regularly incurred to *remain* in business (i.e., for any level of output), but that do not vary with the level of output

\


Variable costs (VC)
:    Costs that increase with the quantity produced.

\

Sunk costs
:     Costs that have been incurred in the past that can never be recovered.

- Sunk costs should not enter into *any* economic decisions.
- FC from previous years are sunk costs; FC for future years are not.

\
<!---
This is not covered at this point in the text. \
 However, this should be revision from last year.

*Note - 2019:* We are skipping the discussion of the short-run here: we will assume all inputs can be adjusted.

# Profit maximisation and supply [NS Ch 8 (\*)] [1 hour]


<!---

Todo: give some motivation here!

-->

## Lecture  (1 hour) - Profit maximisation and supply - coverage

- NS: Ch 8
- T1:07a-07b

- 8.1 The nature of firms (why they exist, goals, etc)
- 8.2 Profit maximisation
- 8.3 Marginal revenue

NOTE: includes trivial perfect competition case and 'monopoly' case

- 8.4 Marginal revenue curve
- 8.5 Supply decisions of a price-taking firm

***

*Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study)*

1. Understand the economist's definition(s) of a firm, and its goals
1. Learn what 'marginal revenue' is
- (and why it is less than the market price for a firm facing downward sloping demand)
- but equal to the market price for a price-taking firm
1. Understand the price and output choice (condition) for a price-taking firm
- and a firm's shut-down/entry decision
- and what *is* a 'price-taking firm'?


***


**Context**

- We considered production functions and cost ...


<br> <br> \bigskip

*Now:* what **output** should the firm set to maximise profits?

<br> <br> \bigskip

*(Next: the consequences of this for the market)*

## Important aside: What are 'firms' and why do they exist?


Standard (classical) economics definition: A *firm* is an entity that transforms inputs into outputs.

<br> <br> \bigskip


We assume a firm's goal is to maximise profit.



Ronald Coase: Why do large entities called 'firms' exist


<br> <br> \bigskip


- Many activities, own many assets
- Often use 'command and control' within firms rather than markets


`r format_with_col("Advanced footnote","RawSienna")`^[This spawned a large literature on the 'theory of the firm' emphasizing things like incomplete contracts, hold-up, relationship specific assets, lobbying costs, and more.]



### Marginal revenue {-}

Marginal revenue
:     The additional gross income a firm gains from increasing the quantity it supplies by one unit


Remember, given its choice of production the firm will always choose the highest price
at which it can sell all the units it has produced.

`r format_with_col("We will come back to this when we discuss","gray")` [monopolies](#monopolies-pd)

<br> <br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("Q: What will be the impact of increasing quantity on a firm's revenue??","blue")`


<br> <br> \bigskip


- It can sell an additional unit at some price
- But it may have to reduce prices on *all* units to do this (more on this later)





### MR for firm facing 'downward-sloping demand'^[See example in table 1 in text.] {-}


- Single price (assume) $\rightarrow$ sell more only by reducing price on *all units*
    - E.g., sell 51 units rather than 50 by reducing price from £1 to £0.99
- Marginal revenue is less than market price here *because*
    - Get (new) market price for additional unit $\rightarrow$ + £0.99
    - But lose £0.01 on all previous 50 units $\rightarrow$ - £0.50
    - So MR is £0.49


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("Mrillustrated.png")
```

***

**MR curves be like:**

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("mrcurve.png")
```


`r format_with_col("Q: Why might MR curves typically decrease in Q?","blue")`^[ Ans: Demand curves slope down, so less revenue for each additional unit. \
 Also, the *impact* of the reduced price is greater because the more we sell the more units this affects.]


***

### MR for a 'price-taking' firm {-}

Under 'perfect competition' (which we will describe soon), each firm is a 'price-taker'

Each firm:

- gets market price P for each additional unit
- the firm is small, so its output has (virtually) no impact on P ^[The NS text gives a good illustration and examples of why it is fine to assume that a small producer's output has no impact on price]
    - (More on this later)



<br> <br> \bigskip

*Thus its marginal revenue is constant at $P$*!


`r format_with_col("Note that for such a firm, the total revenue curve will be a straight line ... double quantity, double revenue","gray")`


***


## Profit-maximisation

- If operating, set optimal output $q^*$
- Under standard assumed conditions


`r format_with_col("Advanced footnote","RawSienna")`^[ There are specific conditions for the existence of a 'unique maximum-profit quantity'. E.g., this will be ensured by everywher- decreasing marginal revenue and increasing or nondecreasing marginal costs]

- ... profits are maximised at the unique $q^*$ such that $MR=MC$


<br> <br> \bigskip


This holds *for all types of firms*

- For firms with market power ('price-setters') the MR takes into account the downward sloping demand curve.

- For a price-taker, setting $MR(q)=MC(q)$ means setting $P=MC(q)$, because $P=MR(q)$


\textcolor{blue}{Q:  Why? Suppose actual output was greater or less than q*.
Explain what is true about marginal profits as output increases or decreases.}^[Ans:
if q>q*, MR, which is decreasing in q, will be below MC.
Firm can do better if it reduces q somewhat-- cost decrease will be larger than revenue decrease.
 If $q<q^{\ast}$, $MR<MC$ -- better to increase q and revenue increases more than costs]


**Consider a firm with market power:**


The firm wants to maximise profit. This means making the vertical distance between the revenue and cost curves as large as possible. \
If the curves had differing slopes, profits could be increased by adjusting output in the direction in which the curves diverged.

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='100%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("fig8-1.png")
```



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/monopmcmr.png")
```



## MR=mc condition for price-taking firm

$$MR(q) = P$$

 knitr::include_graphics("pcmcmr.png")
```
-->

***


## Supply decisions of a price-taking firm

**Price-taking firms:**

- Can sell all output at market price P*. Will price at P*.
    - Set p<P* $\rightarrow$  Sell same amount, earn less. Not smart!
    - Set p>P* $\rightarrow$ Sell no units. Bad move!


***

**...price-taking firms**


- How much to produce?
    - Standard assumption: $MC(0)<P^*$,  $MC(q)$ increasing in q (assumed)
    - (... or at least there is some region for which AVC< $P^*$)
    - Thus choose q for which $MC(q) = P^*$
    - 'Perfectly competitive firms price at marginal cost'

- But if P* is below your average cost for *any possible* output q you must shut down!
    - If it's below '(short run) average variable costs', shut down right away; each unit you produce adds to your loss!
    - If it's below your (long-run) average cost, shut down before incurring any more fixed costs, you will never be able to produce at a profit!


*NOTE:* I am not focusing on distinction between short and long run cost curves in this module

# Perfect competition in a single market [NS Ch 9  (\*)] [1 hour] (L7) {#perfect-competition}

## Lecture  (1 hour) -  Perfect competition in a single market  - coverage
- NS: Ch 9
- T1:05


- `r format_with_col("Third problem set: Costs/production, perfect competition in a single market, Welfare/General Equilibrium ","blue")`

***


*Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study)*

1. Understand how firms' supply curves aggregate to a *market* supply curve?
1. Revise: what is a 'perfectly competitive market'?
1. Understand the importance of entry and exit in such a market, and the implications for the short and long run:
- firms' economic profits
- market price and
- reaction to a shift in the demand curve
1. Understand what a *long run market supply curve* might look like, and why
1. Understand *consumer surplus* and *producer surplus* and the implications for welfare analysis
1. Understand the concept of Pareto Optimality
1. Learn the argument for why a perfectly competitive market may lead to a Pareto Optimal outcome (under certain conditions)
1. Understand the critiques of this, and the idea of 'market failure'


***

### Motivating questions {-}

- With many 'price taking firms', how does *aggregate* supply respond to changes in demand?
    - Can such firms make a profit in the short run? In the long run?
- If demand for a good increases (demand curve shifts out), because preferences change, or because population increases,
    - ... should we expect the price of the good to rise in the short or long run?

<br> <br> \bigskip

**Deeper:**

Should we expect 'competition' to lead to the most efficient outcomes, and if so, when and under what conditions?

- Would it be better to restrict the entry of firms, or have a single firm with a guaranteed monopoly?

- Would it be better to restrict or regulate prices?

These questions are at the core of political and economic debates
throughout the 19th and 20th century. Mercantilists vs physiocrats (classical liberals),
Socialists vs laissez-faire
debates over 'industrial policy' and 'trust-busting', etc

***


**Urgent question: Brexit**^[This seemed to be an urgent question in 2016 when I first wrote this section. It still seems to be an urgent question.]

<br> <br> \bigskip

Trade with Europe may default to WTO terms

<br> <br> \bigskip

$\rightarrow$ Very large tariffs on some goods, 'non-tariff barriers' on others


<br> <br> \bigskip


UK (and EU) firms: Unknown impact on input prices, demand curves, competition, etc.

- Can 'GE models' help predict these and help firms plan and reoptimise?

- How long will it take to return to some 'equilibrium'?


<br> <br> \bigskip


- Fewer firms in UK markets $\rightarrow$ less competition $\rightarrow$ loss of consumer surplus?




We will have to decide on many new regulations bundled with new trade deals:

- Which are 'pro-competitive' or redress market failures and which restrain trade?

***



`r format_with_col("Skip the NS material on 'Pricing in the very short run'","gray")`

## SR supply



- Number of firms in the market is fixed: no entry/exit

- Existing firms will respond to demand shifts by changing their quantity supplied

- Market supply curve: sum of each firm’s supply curve



Under perfect competition each firm

- must charge market price $P^*$
- produces q so that $mc(q)=P^*$
    - as long as there is some output q where $AVC \leq P*$

\


<br> <br> \bigskip


Thus, for every price $P^{*}$, it produces the $q$ where $mc(q)=P^{*}$.

\


<br> <br> \bigskip

This implies that its mc curve *is* its supply curve!
\

For a further revision, this process is well mapped out in a step-by step Powerpoint you can download at\url{http://web.mnstate.edu/stutes/notes/mankiwjustpp/firms_competitive.ppt}^[Start from the beginning, this is specifically referred to beginning on about slide 20 'The Firm’s Long-Run Decision to Exit or Enter a Market'; use 'presentation mode'. However, note that slide 19 states 'the firm considers its sunk costs when deciding to exit, but ignores them when deciding whether to shut down.' This is not stated precisely. They are referring to those 'fixed costs' which must be incurred at regular intervals (e.g., a license fee every year)... from the pov of midyear, this years' license fee is sunk, but next year's is not.]

**To get the market supply curve:**

Sum each firm's supply curve *horizontally*.


(recalling that a price-taking firm's supply curve is the relevant part of its MC curve.)

This is shown below:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("srsupply.png")
```


## SR Price determination

- Sum each firm's supply curve (part of MC curve) to get the *market* supply curve
- Sum individual demand curves to get *market* demand curve
- At what point do these intersect?
    - At this price $P^*$ we have $Q_D(P^*)=Q_S(P^*)$
    - Call this the (short run) *equilibrium* price






- This price may be above *average* variable or even *average total* costs for many firms ($P^*>AC$)

    - They can make real *economic* profits! (But only in the short run.)


To avoid confusion, recall that firms are producing where their *marginal* costs equal the market price. \
MC are often assumed to *increase* as quantity increases; this means that only the cost of the *last* unit produced equals $P^*$. \
Previous units had marginal costs *below* $P^*$. Thus *average* (variable) costs may be below $P^*$

### Price signal {-}

The price acts as a signal (leading to efficient choices):

- to firms, telling them 'how much to produce'


It tells them: ''Don't produce past the point where your marginal cost exceeds the price you can get in the market.''

At the price where the market 'clears' $Q_d=Q_s$.

And a signal

- to consumers, telling them 'how much to purchase'
    - and 'which consumers should obtain the units produced'?


<br> <br> \bigskip

By the definition of the market-clearing price $P^*$, \
consumers can buy all they desire at P*, \
i.e., buy units until the last unit they buy gives them a marginal utility of $P^*$.


<br> <br> \bigskip

This foreshadows a result we will come to later, the efficiency of equilibrium outcomes (under given conditions).
\
The above result means that each consumer values the last unit they consume at the same amount. \
Thus, we *never* have that the 'wrong' consumer obtains the good; \
which implies there can be no further gains from 'exchange among consumers'. \

If prices were too low (e.g., because of a price ceiling), $Q_d>Q_s$ \
demand would have to be rationed, and consumers who valued the product more than other consumers might not get as much.

## Shifts in S and D curves^[Note that much of this may be revision for many of you.]



## The Long run

Here we assume 'free entry and exit' of firms, and a large number of firms have access to the same production process.

Suppose *positive economic profits* in an industry (for efficient producers)^[For a further revision, this process is well mapped out in a step-by step Powerpoint you can download: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/vyvao528job7q0q/fc.ppt?dl=0> (This is specifically referred to beginning on slide 39; use 'presentation mode')]

- I.e., $P^*>AC(q)$ for some q
    - $\rightarrow$ Firms enter
    - $\rightarrow$ Supply curve shifts out
    - $\rightarrow$ equilibrium price declines
    - $\rightarrow$ profits decline
    - repeat until economic profit falls to zero
    - i.e., until $P^*=AC(q)$ for the minimum AC q


\textcolor{gray}{Note that positive economic profits are sometimes called 'supernormal profits.' \
 Remember, economic profits are profits *after* subtracting the (opportunity) cost of capital, management, and other inputs.}


- Now suppose *negative economic profits* in an industry (for efficient producers)
- I.e., $P^*<AC(q)$ for any q
    - $\rightarrow$ Firms exit
    - $\rightarrow$ Supply curve shifts inwards
    - $\rightarrow$ equilibrium price rises
    - $\rightarrow$ profits rise
    - repeat until economic profit rises to zero
    - i.e., until $P^*=AC(q)$ for the minimum AC q


<br> <br> \bigskip

***

**Long Run Equilibrium**

*In long run equilibrium:*

- Firms choose output to maximize their profits
    - Profit max: $P^* = MC(q)$

No firms in the market want to exit, and no firms out of the market want to enter

Zero economic profits:

$P^* = AC(q)$


*Also:*

With free entry and exit (and no limits on production)...


All firms in the market must produce the quantity that *minimizes* their average cost,

and all must have the same average cost.

- I.e., $P* = min AC(q) = MC(q)$ for any firm in the market
- I.e., the MC curve intersects the AC curve at its minimum point.
    - And this is the same average cost for all firms

<br> <br> \bigskip

All firms (in the market) produce $q$ that *minimizes* their AC,  and for all firms this is the *same* average cost.

*Why is this the case?*

Why is  $P* = min [AC(q)] = MC(q)$? Which implies...

- no profit in equilibrium and firms produce at P=MC.

- and thus implies that  $P*=AC(q)=MC(q)$ for all firms in the market.



<br> <br> \bigskip

*Answer 'by contradiction':*

- Suppose here that a firm were producing at a point *above* it's minimum AC,
    - i.e., if $AC(q)> min [AC(q)]$

- it could instead produce at the q that minimised its AC, and make a profit (contradicting the above)

- ... (and so would other firms, who'd be induced to enter)


We assume a large number of firms have access to this efficient technology. \
As previously mentioned, entry shifts the supply curve out, equilibrium price falls, until the point where $P^*=AC(q)$ for firms producing at this lowest AC point.

## Long Run (LR) Supply

- We have the SR supply curve (upward sloping)
- But we know that in the LR this will shift out in response to a price change
- Taking this shift into account gives us the *Long Run Supply Curve*



To avoid confusion, note: \
In the SR there are movements *along* this curve in response to price changes. \
In the longer run, it does shift in response to price changes, as firms enter. \
The LR supply curve, which we will now define, does *not* shift in response to price changes \
But other things may cause it to shift, like changes in input costs

<br> <br> \bigskip

**So what will the LR supply curve look like?**

- If demand shifts out, do more enter and produce at the same efficient minimum AC?
    - Depends on whether entry and higher aggregate production *change* the firms' cost functions
    - *Input costs* may rise; increased demand for scarce inputs, skilled workers and public resources
    - (Also, other potential 'externalities' between firms, consumers, e.g., network externalities)


DR opinion...^[For a variety of reasons, we shouldn't always expect the LR curve to be upward sloping. It might also be flat or downward sloping. Thus, if the demand curve for, e.g., microchips or personalised software shifts out, we may see that equilibrium price *declines* in the long run.]

<br> <br> \bigskip

*As alluded to in the introduction, this is relevant when we want to consider tje impact of long run population and economic growth*

Economic and population growth leads to increased demands for most products (especially natural resources and other primary products). The shape of the LR supply curve tells us whether real resource prices will increase rapidly over time. \

The relative slope for different products tells us which prices will rise *relative* to prices for other goods. E.g., will housing become relatively more or less expensive?

## Consumer and producer surplus, efficiency

Consumer surplus (reprise)
:     The extra value individuals receive from consuming a good over what they pay for it. What people would be willing to pay for the right to consume a good at its current price.

- The area between the demand curve and the market price

<br> <br> \bigskip

Producer surplus
:     The extra value producers get for a good in excess of the opportunity costs they incur by producing it. What all producers would pay for the right to sell a good at its current market price.

- The area between the supply curve and the market price


Basically producer surplus is profit + unavoidable costs. \
In the SR you cannot shut down and avoid the fixed costs, whether or not you sell any units. \
Since you are already incurring these, they don't count against the benefit you would get from selling at the market price.

- In the LR, profits are zero, and all costs are variable, so producer surplus is zero^[Adv: When a firm owns a unique resource it can arguably make a LR profit called a 'Ricardian rent'. However this could be seen as the return to an asset which should be 'charged against' these profits.]

### In what sense is a competitive market efficient? {-}

Economically efficient allocation of resources: maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
- At market equilibrium there are no more mutually beneficial exchanges

<br> <br> \bigskip

Basically, a *competitive* market *in equilibrium* maximizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus.


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("consumerprodrsurplusmax.png")
```


*Note:*
Q* maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus. \
Any other quantity yields a lower sum. \
E.g., at Q1 we 'lose' the triangle FEG \
 ... this is called a 'deadweight loss' ('DWL') as it is a loss to society, it just disappears.

***

We can use these models and concepts to study things like

- 'Who suffers from a tax' in the LR and SR?
- Who gains from technological innovation?
- Who gains and who is harmed by trade restrictions, and do the costs outweigh the benefits?

## Suggested practice problems from Nicholson and Snyder Chapter 9 (12th ed)

'Micro-quizes'
9.2, 9.3, 9.4,

'Problems':
- 9.3a and b
- 9.5?
- 9.9 a-d?


## Important caveat

`r format_with_col("Consider:","blue")` Should price-taking firms and perfect competition be our 'baseline' dominant model?

`r format_with_col("Is it reasonable to assume?","blue")`

- Free entry of firms/no 'barriers'?

- Homogenous products?

- Descreasing returns to scale at some point?


These conditions will indeed lead to perfect competition/MC pricing.

But many markets have large entry costs, first-mover advantages, and perhaps continuously increasing returns to scale. This will lead to  monopoly or oligopoly in the absence of regulation.

Perhaps even more crucially, most products are also 'differentiated'; if one firm charges slightly more than another firm, it will still capture the demand from those people whose are 'close' to it. People will pay a little extra to not travel as far. They will also pay a little extra to get the product that most suits their preferences. In this case, with free entry, we have something known as  'monopolistic competition', which has some of the characteristics of monopoly (e.g., pricing above marginal cost) and some characteristics of perfect competition (e.g., zero long-run profits). This model is  another candidate for bring the dominant model; there is an active debate about this!

# Key principles for efficiency and 'general' equilibrium

## General equilibrium and efficiency: Coverage

- This is a very brief excerpt and summary of the material in NS chapter 10, with some additional motivation
- If you understand these slides/notes you don't have to read chapter 10


We can show that *under certain conditions* competitive markets will be efficient in equilibrium.

However:

- Some markets may not reach equilibrium 'quickly'
- These conditions may not hold $\rightarrow$ *market failure*

- Efficiency itself does not imply preferred outcomes: there can be a great deal of inequality

***

*General Equilibrium* analysis considers the entire economy as a system of markets which may interact with one another

- General equilibrium: a set of prices so that $Q_s(P)=Q_d(P)$ in all markets, including input markets
- Markets are interdependent
    - E.g., a government push for tomato consumption may shift tomato demand out and prices up
    - this may lead in the LR, to a shift out in tomato supply curves (firms enter)
    - this may increase the demand for *inputs* such as farm labour, raising the cost of production of other vegetables
    - etc.
- Will we return to equilibrium, and with what prices and quantities?
- Stay tuned true believers! (and take more Econ, because we won't cover it here)

***

Overall Pareto efficiency: no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off

- If we *could* do so, we would not be at an efficient point


*Note:*
Pareto efficiency is hard to disagree with, as a policy goal; \
if we could move to a situation where some were better off and none made worse off, we should do it.

Overall efficiency requires several conditions: Productive, Exchange, and Top-level efficiency


Efficiency in production (being on the PPF)
:     No way to reallocate inputs to increase production of one good without reducing production of another


<br> <br> \bigskip

\begin{centering}

Given society's resources, we are producing 'as much as possible'

Efficiency in production?

 knitr::include_graphics("self-checkout.jpg")
```



\textcolor{gray}{Note: Basic argument for productive efficiency of competitive equilibrium:
Firms hire more of each input until its 'bang for buck' is the same as all other inputs,
and a single market price for the input will ensure this is the same across firms.
This 'equilibrium' input price must reflect its marginal productivity
in producing the 'last unit' for each and every firm.}

***



Efficiency in consumption (exchange efficiency)
:     No way to reallocate output amongst consumers to make them all better off


<br> <br> \bigskip


<br> <br> \bigskip

\begin{centering}

Given what we're producing, it is going to the 'right consumers'.

\end{centering}

*Note--* Basic argument for productive efficiency of competitive equilibrium:
If, given the 'endowments', one person values A in units B more than someone else,
an equilibrium price ensures that they will trade these amongst one another until each has the same MRS
The 'Edgeworth box' offers a graphical demonstration that this yields a Pareto optimum (given the amounts produced).

Given our inputs, we can produce 'efficiently', i.e, along the PPF,


and given the amounts of each good produced, it is 'consumed by the right people' (no more room for trade) ...

We need to produce the right *combination* of goods.

<br> <br> \bigskip
<br> <br> \bigskip

Efficient allocation of resources ('top-level' condition)
:     No way to produce more of one good and less of another to make all consumers better off

Note:

Basic argument for top-level efficiency of competitive equilibrium:
Equilibrium prices from exchange reflect each consumer's marginal rates of substitution for their  last unit
This signals to firms the rate at which *all* consumers would be willing to trade off A for B at the margin
In equilibrium firms produce at a point where the cost tradeoffs between A and B (slope of PPF) reflects these prices.

First fundamental theorem of welfare economics
:     A general competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient, under standard assumptions.

- Loose intuition: free exchange leaves no room for mutually-beneficial improvements, and firms and consumers optimise

Second fundamental theorem
:     Under some fancy assumptions, any Pareto efficient outcome is a competitive equilibrium for some pattern of initial endowments

- So if we could costlessly redistribute *endowments*, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome by doing so, and then relying on the free market.

***

First fundamental theorem of welfare economics
:     A general competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient, under standard assumptions.

<br> <br> \bigskip

**But these assumptions may not hold, this there may be 'market failures'**

1. Imperfect Competition

- Markets may not be competitive, because of barriers to entry or increasing returns to scale
- $\rightarrow$ Prices may not reflect marginal costs, leading to 'deadweight losses'


<br> <br> \bigskip

2. Externalities, public goods, altruism

The assumptions require 'anything someone values' is bought and sold in the market on their own behalf.
But:

- Externalities: All costs (and benefits) may not be priced; e.g., pollution
- Public goods (and bads): Many people may benefit from the same good (e.g., fireworks)
- Altruism/interdependent utilities: People may care about *others'* consumption


<br> <br> \bigskip

3. Asymmetric information: People may have different information about the state of the world (costs, risks, a good's quality)

4. Bounded rationality: people may not choose in their own best interests


***

**Second Welfare theorem** implied that if we could costlessly redistribute *endowments*, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome by doing so, and then relying on the free market.

- But redistribution via 'optimal lump-sum' taxes is not so easy, as endowments may be unobservable

- And redistribution based on things you can affect, e.g. income, may distort incentives.

*Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study)*

1. Learn how economists define a public good
- Be able to assess whether something fits into this category
1. Understand what 'market failures are'
1. Learn and be able to explain why a competitive market will usually *undersupply* a public good (but may still supply *some* of it)
1. Understand the difficulties *government* may face in providing the right amount of a public good
1. Get a sense of the general patterns and evidence on *voluntary* provision of public goods, including in 'lab experiments'
- and what 'lab experiments' in economics are



<br> <br> \bigskip

Outline: What is a public good, why do markets fail to provide these optimally, (how) can governments provide these optimally, when do people provide these voluntarily?

<br> <br> \bigskip


**Motivation**

- Policy: The 'public goods argument' is critical to justify many government programmes (military, environmental cleanup, research, etc)
- Management: Firms/workers can only profit from providing a public good through getting subsidies or by turning it into a private good.

## Market failures

- Occur when prices don't fully reflect the marginal social benefits or costs
    - Provide scope for political intervention
    - How does this happen?
    - One potential source of market failure: Public Goods

## Public Goods (attributes, categories)
What are the characteristics of a public good?



*Def* -- A **Pure Public Good** is a good that is both

<br> <br> \bigskip

1. *Non-excludable*: Once the good is provided, it is impossible/costly to prevent any individual from using/benefiting from it.


*Note:* This even includes individuals who have not paid for it

<br> <br> \bigskip

Opposite (and alt definition)
*Exclusive goods*: ... a good is exclusive if it is relatively easy to bar people from benefitting from it once it has been produced


<br> <br> \bigskip

2. *Non-rival:* One person's consumption doesn’t reduce the quantity available for others.

- The fact that some people use the good doesn’t prevent others from using the *same* good.


- There is no “crowding.”

Alt (equivalent def):

- Providable to additional users at zero marginal (social) cost.

-  Consumption of additional units of the good involves zero marginal social cost of production. (E.g., if we had produced a film but restricted it to subscribers, the marginal social cost of letting the whole world download it is essentially zero; the exclusion would take us away from the 'utility frontier')





Q: think of some examples.


*Note:*
In market economies, private suppliers provide the majority of goods and services to consumers. However, certain goods are publicly provided. These include for example defense, education, and health. Why does the government instead of the market provide these goods?  Which characteristics differentiate goods that are privately provided from goods that are publicly provided? How do we define public goods?
The terminology might induce the conclusion that 'public goods are good that are publicly provided as opposed to private goods which are privately provided.' This conclusion is simply WRONG! The public or private nature of the good is an intrinsic characteristic of goods that is not related to the provider of the good
Hence, it may well be that the state provides a private good or that the market provides a public good.

- Aid to the needy
- Loud music coming from my window
- Disease control
- Economic research
- The justice system
- Fireworks in Disney World
- The 2012 Olympics in London

***

**The basic idea**

If a good is *non-rival* then additional provision is costless.
Thus,

- if exclusion is possible, and *any* positive price is charged, some are deterred from consuming it
- this is inefficient: people who could benefit from the good, at no cost to others, will not consume it :(

If a good is *non-excludable* it will be difficult to charge people for it

- many might prefer to wait for *others* to buy it, and then they enjoy it anyways (free-ride), which could lead to coordination problems


and...

<br> <br> \bigskip


Even if each person provided it for their *own* benefit (on the assumption that no one else would), they would typically choose *too little* from a social POV...


<br> <br> \bigskip

Considering their own marginal benefits (and MRS) versus the price or cost, not the *social* marginal benefit (essentially, a positive externality)




<br> <br> \bigskip

But if firms cannot charge for its full value, they might not pay the fixed costs to develop/build/provide it

- Who would pay to produce a film that is freely pirated/distributed?
- Who would pay to develop a drug that must be priced at its marginal cost?
- Why contribute to police protection for your village, if your neighbours will pay for it anyways?


*Note:* Loosely, 'rivalryness' basically relates to whether market provision will be *efficient*; 'excludability' tells you whether firms can make *some revenue* from providing it, selling the same prooduced good to more than one person (or to a 'club' of people)

***

### Application: drug development {-}

*Drug R\&D may be a public good, or a common resource*

- Expensive to develop and introduce a new drug -- 'sunk costs' once developed
- But cheap to copy and produce; without patent protection may have $P=mc$ and no ex-post profit to compensate for sunk costs
    - $\rightarrow$ No incentive to develop drugs without patent protection guaranteeing 'excludability' and a limited monopoly
- But ex-post, patent protection is costly; drug produced for a few pennies sold for £1000's
    - People may not buy, or NHS may not cover
    - $\rightarrow$ Inefficient: some consumers may value drug at £100's, far above MC, yet they don't consume it
- Possible solution: Government *awards* and subsidies for drug development.


*Note:* In fact, governments do fund and subsidise R\&D. But there are difficulties here too. Governments may free-ride off of other governments. It is also for government to know whom to fund, hard to quantify the benefits to potential drugs, and offering 'prizes' to developers offers its own challenges: how to asses if the drug is good enough to deserve the prize? And too many firms working on the same drug may be wasteful.

\medskip


## Public Goods and Market Failure

The First Welfare Theorem's assumptions/conditions do not apply to public goods. Markets do not yield a Pareto Optimal outcome.


*Note:* The market will not produce where the consumers' MRS equals the rate at which public and private goods 'trade off in production'.  More of the public good could be produced by sacrificing some of the private good, and consumers will be better off.
\

- Non-excludability $\rightarrow$  no price or suboptimal price $\rightarrow$ firms don't get the correct signals for production

- Non-rivalry $\rightarrow$ each unit provides benefit to all, consumer choices don't reflect this


### Social benefit of a private good vs a public good {-}

- Overall value of a private good: (area under the) "horizontal sum" of individual marginal benefit curves

- For public goods the aggregate value "sums vertically"

- Social margin benefit of PG sums *vertically*

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pgprovision1.png")
```


*Note:* Even at p=mc, neither consumer will pay for it alone.  Neither flatmate will pay £80 to have the house cleaned, even though it is worth £60 to each flatmate.
\

*Note:* To avoid confusion, note that we are talking about marginal cost as the cost of providing a unit of the public good 'to everyone' \
E.g., one new movie produced, or one firework displayed to the whole city.
Once produced, all benefit, i.e., the cost of letting additional people enjoy it is *zero*.


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("pgprovision2.png")
```

`r format_with_col("Q: What happens here?","blue")`
\
Ans: The individual with the higher valuation purchases q of this public good if it is priced at marginal cost. \

However, he will still purchase less than the *socially optimal* amount, $Q^*$

\


With a binary choice (provide or don't) it is a Prisoner's Dilemma:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

## Solutions to the Public Goods Problem

(you can skip the Lindahl equilibrium discussion)



## Food for thought, discussion

1. What is a public good? What do we call a good with only 1 of these 2 necessary properties?

2. Why does the free market *underprovide* these? Why/when do they provide some amount?



1. What is an example of a public good, perhaps one from your own life that we didn't already mention


2. What are some things you think may lead to more *voluntary* provision of public goods?


***

### Government's role {-}

- Pure public goods are not provided optimally by the free market, i.e., voluntarily


*Note:* except in really special and lucky cases

- (although people do contribute to public goods, e.g., making charitable donations, for various reasons)

This is a justification for government: to enforce contributions to public goods, and make everyone better off


`r format_with_col("Adv: or, allowing heterogeneous tastes, achieve a “potential Pareto improvement”; those who benefit could compensate those who are harmed and still all would be better off.","RawSienna")`

- **But** it's hard to determine tastes for the public good, hence difficult to determine the optimal level!


## Revealing the Demand for Public Goods (brief)

Suppose some people like fireworks, and some don't. How many should the town pay for?

i. Ask everyone to state the number of fireworks they want, and we choose the average and split costs evenly?


Q: would this work?
\

- $\rightarrow$ Fireworks-lovers may overstate their value to skew the average.


ii. Ask everyone to state number they want; choose average; those who stated more pay more?

- $\rightarrow$ Many people understate their value to avoid having to pay. Doh!

<br> <br> \bigskip

*Difficult or impossible to find a 'mechanism' that leads to 'truth-telling'.*

- Direct voting on each proposal also may not lead to the optimal choice

***

### Voting paradox example {-}

Green party: Green Park $\succ$ Public housing $\succ$ Private housing \

Labour: Public housing $\succ$ Private Housing $\succ$ Green Park \

Conservatives: Private Housing $\succ$ Green Park $\succ$ Public housing \

\

<br> <br> \bigskip

Suppose we have a local council with one member of each party (representing equal-sized constituencies).

<br> <br> \bigskip

- Which proposal would win if they voted on:
    - a Green park versus Public housing?
    - a Green Park versus Private housing?
    - Private housing versus Public housing?


<br> <br> \bigskip


*Does a majority vote reveal a clear 'social preference'?*

<br> <br> \bigskip

No, not here.

***

## Lab evidence on *voluntary* provision of Public Goods

 Typical “Public Goods Experiment”

- Four undergraduates  seated at a table. Each given an 'endowment' of \$5.
- Told that each can choose to invest some or all of it in a 'group project.'

\
<br> <br> \bigskip

- Each simultaneously puts an amount between \$0 and \$5 in envelope. (Or via computer terminals).

- Experimenter collects the “contributions” and doubles the total, divides this equally among the group.

- The private benefit from this “public good” = one half of total contributions.
    - (But I only get back *half* of my own contribution)

***

**Basic results**

- On average, subjects contribute halfway between everything and nothing
- Contributions decline with repetition, but not to zero
- Face to face communication improves the rate of contribution



Adv: More recent evidence finds that this decline seems to be related to issues of reciprocity, fairness and conditional cooperation. \
When conditional cooperators are separated (or can self segregate) a higher level of cooperation is maintained.

### Price discrimination in the media {-}

Moneybox - \url{https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/money-box/id263570678?mt=2&i=1000379397237} -- many mis-statements; can you identify them?

***

### Lecture goals {-}

1. What are monopolies and what are barriers to entry?
2. How do monopolies choose prices and quantities?
3. What are the social (welfare) consequences of monopoly?


4. What is 'price discrimination'?
5. What forms can price discrimination take, and how does it increase a monopoly's profits?
6. How does price discrimination affect social welfare, and whom does it help or hurt?
7. (Very briefly: other forms of imperfect competition)

***


*Rem*: perfect competition

- free entry and exit
    - $\rightarrow$ zero long-run economic profit
- many many tiny firms
    - $\rightarrow$ firms are price takers
- $\rightarrow$ p=mc
    - And in the long run $p=ATC$ and firms produce at $min(AC)$


<br> <br> \bigskip

\

*these are extreme assumptions; perhaps only a theoretical ideal*

\


<br> <br> \bigskip


- (Firms with market power might set $p>mc$)

***

Opposite extreme: *monopoly*

- A single firm
- Barriers to entry $\rightarrow$ No threat of entry
- Can choose price, which becomes the 'market price'

    - Still, the more it charges the fewer units demanded

    - Chooses a price (or quantity) where MR=MC (like all firms do)

    - Produces 'less than socially optimal quantity' in order to charge a high price and increase its profit

## Barriers to entry


### Technical barriers to entry {-}
- IRS/ Diminishing average cost over a broad range of output
    - $\rightarrow$ 'a natural monopoly'
    - (Here multiple firms producing separately are *less efficient*, cannot produce the lowest cost)
- Special knowledge of a low-cost method of production, or key resource

***

### Legal barriers to entry. {-}

- Patents and copyrights
- Exclusive franchise or license (granted by government, by another firm, by a university)
- Government support for a dominant firm, discouraging/forbidding others

***

... from the 2016 Massachusetts ballot initiative:


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("gaming_open.png")
```



## Monopoly profit-maximisation

- As always, set Q to maximize $QP(Q)-C(Q)$

- leads to optimization where $MR(Q) = MC(Q)$ (assuming P>AC)

- Remember, the 'volume' benefit of increasing Q is countered by
    - Greater cost (producing more always costs more)
    - The need to reduce price (on all units) to get people to buy it


### Graphically: Monopoly profit-max {-}


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("monopprofit1.png")
```

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("monopprofit2.png")
```



*Notes:*
Rem: Firm's revenue is Price $\times$ Quantity. \
Rectangle for a specific point on demand curve. \
Firm' *profit* is this less average cost. \
MR tells you how the 'revenue rectangle' will increase (or decrease) with another unit. \
MC tells you the *cost* of this additional unit.
Where MR>MC, increasing quantity a little bit increases revenue more than costs, thus increasing profit.


***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("monopprofit3.png")
```


*Note:*
Be careful here: \
The price the monopoly can get at quantity $Q^*$ is $P^*$  \
... project up to the *demand* curve NOT the MR curve.

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("monopprofit4.png")
```


*Note:*
Again, remember that revenue is $P^*Q^*$ but costs at $Q^*$ are $Q^* \times AC$ \
 so profit is $(P^*-AC)Q^*$. \
By the way, the AC adds up the MC and the FC and divides by the quantity.

## The deadweight loss of monopoly


*Criticisms of monopoly:*

1. Monopolies produce too little output: allocatively inefficient.

2. There is a redistribution of wealth from consumers to owners.

- But this could be counterbalanced by government redistribution


***

- Compared to perfect competition, a monopoly typically produces less output and charges a higher price

- Some of the consumer surplus under perfect competition is transferred to the monopolist.

- There is also a deadweight loss under monopoly

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("dwl1.png")
```



*Note:*
The difference in monopoly vs perfect competitive quantity \
... difference in price \
... difference in consumer surplus \
... difference in firm profit

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("dwl2.png")
```



*Note:* The differences (costs, transfers) refer to the monopoly outcomes *relative to perfect competition*.

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("dwl3.png")
```

***

*Other criticisms:* Some argue the deadweight loss (DWL) above *understates* the true harm of monopoly

- 'Secure' monopolies don't innovate as much, and spend wastefully?
- Monopolies may expend wasteful resources (lobbying, threats, lawsuits...) to preserve barriers to entry
    - Thus the above monopoly profits may turn into further deadweight losses!

- On the other side, some argue monopolies tend not to persist in the long run, are disciplined by *potential* entry, and have *greater* incentives to innovate

- Empirically, the magnitude of the social cost of monopoly is an open question
    - Estimates range from 0.5\% of GDP to 5\% of GDP

## Price discrimination

Price Discrimination

:      The practice of firms offering different prices to different consumers

- Or different prices for slightly different *products* or quantities,
    - where the difference in price does *not* merely reflect cost difference,
    - with the goal of distinguishing consumers' *willingness to pay* (WTP).


Note: This includes 'volume discounts', or offering an 'all you can eat' plan alongside a per-unit plan

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("exeter_picturehouse.png")
```

Why such a complicated price list?

***

### Why do firms price discriminate? {-}

- It can increase profit

    - by 'extracting more surplus' from consumers

- In general, for a monopoly firm, the ability to identify consumers based on their WTP and charge distinct prices *will* increase profit
    - However, it may increase or decrease *social* (consumer+producer) surplus...
    - Consumer surplus itself may increase or decrease.

***

### The alternative to price discrimination (previous analysis) {-}

Offering a single price for a good for all consumers is known as 'uniform pricing'.

- This does not deal with differences amongst consumers.
- May force you to target a particular group, such as the wealthy, reducing your total sales.
- Under monopoly, this leads to a deadweight loss

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("dwl3.png")
```

***


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("ppd1.png")
```

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("ppd2.png")
```

***

- Price discrimination may seem counter-intuitive: ‘how can offering some consumers lower prices increase profit?’
    - Higher prices increase your profit per unit, but at a higher price you will sell fewer units. The more you charge the less you sell.
    - Some groups of ‘less keen’ consumers are very sensitive to the price, and they will buy very little at a high price, so a lower price would be more profitable.
    - Some groups of ‘more keen’ consumers will buy a lot even at a high price. They are less ‘price-sensitive’, so you want to charge them more.

***

### The three types of price discrimination {-}

1. Individual-based (First degree; at best 'perfect')

\



*Note*: Targeting a price at each consumer; may be done on the internet or on a discretionary basis by an individual seller. \
 'Perfect' means the seller exactly predicts and charges each consumer her valuation.


<br> <br> \bigskip


2. Self-selection (Second degree)

\




*Note:*
Here the firm doesn't know each consumer's valuations, or is not allowed to 'discriminate' by charging different prices to different people
Instead, it sells different bundles, quantities,
  or qualities of products to get high and low-value consumers to separate themselves...
 E.g., first-class seats.

 <br> <br> \bigskip


`r format_with_col("Note: To fully analyse these problems we need to know the techniques of 'mechanism design under asymmetric information', which we are not covering in this module","gray")`



<br> <br> \bigskip


3. Group-based (Third degree; 'market separation')



*Note:*
Here the firm finds something identifiable and inherent about the consumer \
 that is indicative of her likely valuations (and price-sensitivity). \
It might be her age, nationality, student-status, or even perhaps her income.


***

### First-degree and/or 'perfect' price discrimination {-}

- The firm can offer each individual a different price for each unit they purchase.

- Assuming you know what the consumer is willing to pay, you can make the *highest possible profit*; that is called ‘perfect’ price discrimination.


<br> <br> \bigskip


Perfect price discrimination
:     Charging each consumer (for each unit) the *maximum* he or she would be willing to pay, i.e., her valuation


<br> <br> \bigskip


- Here the monopolist would extract *all the available surplus*; no consumer surplus remains
- Because monopolists extracts *all* the possible surplus, this is efficient
    - Because max(total value of good - cost) $\rightarrow$ max(CS+PS)

- But perfect PD is a rare/impossible extreme: requires mind reading
    - Close example: Website targets an individualised price to each consumer, based on clues like time-of-day, web clicks, cookie data, IP location.
    - But even this is not really *perfect* price discrimination:



*Note:*
Here, the seller does not really know exactly what the consumer is willing to pay; he is using broad clues.


Note: See Shiller, B. R. (2013, or updated version). First degree price discrimination using big data.

 knitr::include_graphics("ppd3.png")
```

```

***


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("ppd5.png")
```


***

### Second-degree price discrimination {-}

- Firm is unable to differentiate between consumers, uses quality/quantity so consumers self-select.
    - Quality- Transport- Different classes, Supermarkets- budget products
    - Quantity- Supermarkets- Larger quantities at lower prices per unit; i.e., 'nonlinear pricing'


\

- 8 oz coffee for £1.60 vs. 16 oz. for £2.00
- 20 p per oz vs. 12.5p per oz.
- (with linear pricing there would be the same price of 15p/oz.)
    - Result: with 2 prices monopoly can get 'high value' consumers to buy/get more in total without losing 'low-value' consumers


***

- Similar with quality: Don't know who high-valuation flyers are (wtp for travel *itself* varies)
- But may know on *average* that flyers with higher wtp for travel *also* value comfort more
    - Make second-class seats very uncomfortable, first-class luxurious, and charge more for first-class seats
    - Can get consumers with higher values for travel *and* comfort to pay more
    - without losing lower-valuing customers


NOTE: I am not going to cover the algebra nor graphical analysis of second-degree PD, nonlinear pricing, or two-part pricing

***

### The 'self-selection' problem {-}

Train companies must price first and second class such that consumers will self-select.

- If first class is too expensive then the high valuing group will not choose first class

- If second-class is too cheap, both the high and low groups will choose second class

- But if second class is too expensive, the low groups will not buy a ticket.

Lot's of discussion of this in the media, see e.g.,

\href{https://www.1843magazine.com/ideas/the-daily/why-companies-make-their-products-worse}{THIS} article in The Economist

***

### Third-degree price discrimination (3dpd) / Market separation {-}

Third-degree price discrimination/Market-separation
:    The practice of charging different prices to different groups that can be identified

- The firm can differentiate *groups of consumers* or 'local markets', not individuals.
- Each group has a different willingness to pay *on average*
    -  $\rightarrow$ Offer lower prices to lower-valuing groups, higher prices to higher-valuing groups

\

- Example: Students face lower prices for transport, food and other goods as they have a lower willingness to pay
    - Remember: this is *not* done out of charity but to boost profits

***

### Pricing under 3dpd/market separation {-}

- Each group or market has it's own demand $\rightarrow$ marginal revenue curve
    - So set an optimising price quantity *separately* for each group
    - E.g., a discount for the elderly, higher price for the middle-aged
    - Or a lower price in Portugal than in Germany

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("discounts.png")
```

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("Price-discrimination-SNP2.png")
```

### Who benefits from 3DPD? {-}

- Consumers *in identifiable group* with lower wtp face lower prices, thus they benefit
- Consumers *in identifiable group* with higher wtp face higher prices, thus they lose
- Firms can charge higher prices to high-wtp group without losing low-wtp group $\rightarrow$ increase profit


<br> <br> \bigskip


Net welfare result: theoretically uncertain


***

For consumers:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pdwelfare.png")
```

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pdwelfareoverall.png")
```


***


### Why uncertain? {-}

- When groups can be identified as 'low and high valuation'
    - the high-valuation groups get charged more, and thus consume less
    - low-valuation groups get charged less, and consume more
    - Exchange efficiency: *given what is produced*, PD causes it to be consumed by people who value it relatively less!

\

- Production: On the other hand PD can lead more to be produced/consumed


...of the otherwise underproduced good (rem DWL of monopoly) $\rightarrow$ top-level efficiency may increase (or decrease)

- E.g., if with a 'uniform price' only the wealthy went to a restaurant...
    - after PD (early-bird discounts, OAP discounts, benefits discounts) the low-income may also dine in the restaurant
    - $\rightarrow$ more value is produced


- These two effects trade off.
    - Because of the negative 'Exchange efficiency effect', quantity *produced* must increase after PD for it to be beneficial

Quantity increase is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.

***


### But 'arbitrage' can foil price discrimination {-}

- If, e.g., elderly who get discounts could sell the products to the middle-aged...
    - Then middle-aged would always ask them to do this, never pay high prices
    - Firm could no longer profit from this
    - Similar issues with quantity discounts, or 'web cookie' personalised pricing

<br> <br> \bigskip

- So PD only 'works' for goods that are hard to trade, like haircuts
    - Or where purchases are frequent and low-value, and resale markets are difficult



*Note:*
The above issues are sometimes referred to as 'transactions costs'


***

### David's idea: A new policy tool {-}

- People with low-incomes tend to have lower-wtp for most goods
- Government can typically identify and verify incomes
- Governments could allow and encourage low-income consumers to get an ID indicating this
- Governments could allow and encourage firms to use this for price-discrimination


<br> <br> \bigskip

\

- Firms would increase profit
- Low-income households would benefit, reducing inequality
- Net impact on efficiency uncertain; worth investigating

See the readings on this:  'The Government may want to encourage price discrimination by income' [linked here](https://davidreinstein.wordpress.com/research-and-publications/)

## Natural monopolies and regulation (very brief!)

- Where an industry involves a 'natural monopoly' (IRS) the most efficient production is a unified production process
    - But if a monopoly reigns it overcharges and underprovides
    - Government may want to allow/enforce monopoly privileges but *regulate* price it can charge
    - Difficulty: Government wants to regulate $p=AC$, but it doesn't know firms' actual cost function (asymmetric information)
    - Firm wants government to think it is high cost


This yields another mechanism design 'hidden information' 'principal-agent problem'

\

## What's up with uncertainty?


\

Previous discussion: Consumers make choices with \underline{known} consequences


`r format_with_col("But in the real world many important economic decisions involve risk.","gray")`

<br> <br> \bigskip

Here: Choices with *unknown* consequences (but known *probabilities* of each outcome)\footnote{Adv: In the real world, people may also make choices in contexts with unknown probabilities; this is called 'ambiguity' or 'Knightian uncertainty'. This is out of the scope of this module.}

How to consider this in a utility-maximisation framework?

The standard framework for this involves maximising 'expected utility'.


`r format_with_col("Warning:","red")` Making choices to maximise expected utility is *not* the same as making choices to maximise expected monetary outcomes. This is one of the main points here. A good share of students get this mixed up!

## Probability concepts: a quick review

Probability
:     The relative frequency with which an event occurs, or can be expected to occur.

- Always between 0 and 1

`r format_with_col("Adv: Note, there are some debates, e.g., between 'Bayesians' and 'Frequentists' over the meaning of probability.","gray")`


`r format_with_col("Q: If $p$ is the probability an event occurs, what is the probability this event does *not* occur?","blue")`

Ans: $1-p$


***

Expected value
:     The 'average outcome' of an uncertain variable (general definition)

<br> <br> \bigskip

:     The average monetary (or goods) payoff from an uncertain gamble

<br> <br> \bigskip

:     The sum of the value at each possible outcome, weighted by the probability that outcome will occur

`r format_with_col("Adv, maths: When outcomes are in a continuous space, e.g., the returns to a stock can take any of an infinite number of possible values, the expected value becomes a definite integral rather than a sum.","RawSienna")`


- This is *NOT* the same as expected utility (coming up); people don't necessary choose the investment with the highest expected value


***

Consider: would you prefer...

a. £ 100,000 with certainty or
b. A 1 in 10 chance of £ 1,000,001 (and otherwise you get nothing)?


`r format_with_col("Which has a higher expected monetary value?","blue")`

*Ans: $EV(b)=£ 100,000.1>EV(a)=£ 100,000$*

<br> <br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("Which gives you greater expected utility?","blue")`

*Ans:* This is unknown. We need to know the individual's *utility function* to know the answer to this.

However, it seems likely that most people would choose b, even though it has a lower expected monetary value, because they are *risk-averse*.


***


**Definitions (loose):**

1. A *Risk-neutral* person always chooses the option with the highest expected monetary value

\


<br> <br> \bigskip

2. A *Risk-averse* person will always prefer a sure thing to a gamble with the same expected monetary value
- She will always prefer gambles with less risk, holding the expected value constant
- She will always reject 'fair gambles' (see below) and prefer certainties
- To accept a (fair) gamble, she must expect a 'risk-premium'

```
-->


3. A *Risk-lover* will always choose fair gambles over certainties, and sometimes choose a gamble that is unfair against her

***

**Example: two possible outcomes**


*Q: What is an example of such an investment with only two outcomes?*

Ans: perhaps making a loan to someone to start a business; they will either pay back the loan with a high interest, or go bankrupt and pay none of it back.

Suppose there is a simple investment.
It will either pay a low (or zero or negative amount) or a high amount.

- It pays X where either $X =x_1$ or $X=x_2$, where $x_1<x_2$

Probability it pays $x_2$ is $p$; thus probability it pays $x_1$ is...?
$Pr(X=x_1)= 1-p$

The expected monetary value sums the values weighted by the probabilities, i.e.,

$EV(X)=(1-p) x_1 + p  x_2$

***

Consider

**Example: two possible outcomes**



It pays X where either $X =x_1$ or $X=x_2$, where $x_1< x_2$

- Specifically, pays £1020 w/ prob. 1\% \& pays £10 w/ prob. 99\%




Thus $EV(X) = 0.01 \times 1020 + 0.99 \times 10 = 10.20 + 9.90 = 20.10$

*As an aside, an interesting example: computing expected value of recent US 'Powerball' lottery [Link HERE](http://uk.businessinsider.com/powerball-lottery-expected-value-jan-9-draw-2016-1?r=US&IR=T)*

`r format_with_col("Note: This is the net expected value of buying a $2 ticket. By this calculation each $2 ticket is worth $3.06 in expected value terms; however, with the adjustments further down in the article, we see this drops considerably and becomes negative in net after taxes.","gray")`


***

Fair gamble
:     A bet with an expected (monetary) value of zero is a 'fair gamble'

<br> <br> \bigskip

Actuarially fair

An investment whose cost is its expected value is 'actuarially fair'

<br> <br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("Consider: Which of the following are fair gambles?","blue")`

- A. 'Double or nothing' bets with a fair coin
- B. Roulette in a casino
- C. A gamble where you win £10 with probability 1/2 and lose £5 with probability 1/2
- D. A gamble where you win £10 with probability 1/4, lose £5 with probability 1/2, and neither lose nor win with the remaining probability?
- E. A stock option (without any transactions fees)

Ans: A and D; E is uncertain, but it is probably a fair gamble

## Example: experimental measures of risk attitudes

Economists try to measure people's level of risk aversion in various ways.

We try to measure 'revealed preferences' from real-world choices. E.g., what premium are people willing to pay to buy insurance for various things,  how much premium do they demand for taking on risky investments (with the same expected monetary values), and how much more do they have to be paid (on average) in jobs with variable compensation?

<br> <br> \bigskip

We also run *experiments* with real or hypothetical payoffs to measure this.


One technique is the Holt and Laury (2002) risk elicitation task:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("holtlaurie.png")
```

`r format_with_col("Asked to choose one in each row (A or B)","gray")`

- Consider, when would you choose A and when would you choose B?

<br> <br> \bigskip

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("holtlauriedetail.png")
```

At what point do people switch from choosing the safe to choosing the risky lottery?

This is a measure of their risk-aversion.  A risk-neutral person would switch to B on the fifth choice.
The later you switch, the more risk averse you reveal yourself to be.

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("holtlauryresults.png")
```

Above: Results for different 'stake sizes'. Most people are risk-averse.  People switch to the risky option later when stakes are higher.


## Expected utility

**Note: this concept is only covered *indirectly* in the text**

- Previous utility functions: predict choices under certainty
    - No predictions for choices with uncertain probabilistic outcomes!
- People don't maximise expected monetary value; tend to be risk-averse

An *Expected Utility* (EU) framework allows for risk-aversion

- Assume each individual has a single 'utility function over *outcomes*' $u(Y)$ over outcomes Y, (with similar properties as our regular utility function)

This 'little u' function is similar to 'regular' utility, but here 'curvature matters'



When making choices involving uncertainty, she does **not** (necessarily) maximise expected monetary value.

Instead, she maximises 'Expected Utility' (EU): the sum of her (VNM) valuations '$u(\cdot)$' under each outcome weighted by the *probability* of each outcome


... I.e., she chooses to maximise the value of her $u(Y)$ function under each outcome $Y$ weighted by the probability of each outcome $p_Y$

- By varying the $u(Y)$ function we can vary the risk preference; ...Risk-loving, risk neutral and risk averse individuals can all be seen as maximizing EU

***

Consider the choice between two gambles and one 'certainty':

1. Earn £1,000,000 with probability 0.1 \& zero with prob. 0.9
2. Earn £100,000 with probability 1/2 \& £50,000 with prob. 1/2
3. Earn £75,000 for certain


<br> <br> \bigskip

Imagine the realised utility $u(y)$ arises from the consumption chosen with income $y$ `r format_with_col("(btw, the utility arising from maximisation under a particular set of income and prices is called 'Indirect Utility')","gray")`

- This should be increasing (because of nonsatiation), thus $u^\prime (y)>0$
- But it mays increase at a *decreasing* rate, implying $u^{\prime \prime}(y)< 0$

This second assumption, called *diminishing marginal utility*,  will imply 'risk aversion'!

Or, if the person is risk-neutral, it may be linear, thus $u(y) = a + by$, thus $u^{\prime \prime}(y)=0$

<br> <br> \bigskip

'r format_with_col("Adv:} \textcolor{gray","RawSienna")`{Note that when we were choosing between two goods under certainty,
the *level* of total utility didn't really matter, only the relative utilities. Now that we are considering gambles, the overall utility level matters, because we need to consider the extent of the tradeoff between 'rich and poor' states.}

<br> <br> \bigskip

Coming back to the choice between two gambles and one 'certainty':

1. $Y_1$: £1,000,000 with probability 0.1 and zero with prob. 0.9
2. $Y_2$: £100,000 with probability 0.5 and £50,000 with prob. 0.5
3. $Y_3$: £75,000 for certain



Considering each *outcome* from any of these...

we know $u(1,000,000) > u(100,000) > u(75,000)> u(50,000) > u(0)$...

but now the *size of the difference* in these utilities matters for your decision!


<br> <br> \bigskip

- Consider Y1 vs Y3: Is 1 million 'more than ten times as good (utility-wise) as 75k?'

- Y2 v Y3: Relative to 75k, does an additional 25k yield a utility gain worth the (equally probable) loss of 25k?

***


**Illustration:** Why the 'size of the difference in u(y) matters' when dealing with uncertainty.

Suppose there is open-enrollment in Oxford, Bristol, Plymouth.

$\rightarrow$ Here I only need to know the *ranking* of utilities of each to know your choices.

- If you choose Oxford over Bristol, even though Oxford costs more, I can infer that for you $U(Oxford)>U(Bristol)$

<br> <br> \bigskip


Now, in contrast suppose the policy is

> A. Rank Oxford over Bristol and you have a 25\% chance of getting into either, and a 50\% chance of Plymouth.

> B. Rank Bristol highest and you have a 100\% chance of getting into Bristol.



Now even if your preferences  are  Oxford $\succ$ Bristol $\succ$ Plymouth, I don't know if you will choose A or B; I would need to know the *strength* of your preferences.


<br> <br> \bigskip


This means that if I observe you choose 'option A' I have learned *more* about your utility than I learned under open enrollment. I have learned that your preference for Oxford over Bristol is  "stronger" than your preference for Bristol over Plymouth.


<br> <br> \bigskip

The EU framework predicts that she chooses the option that maximizes the sum of 'probabilities $\times$ realised utilities $u(Y)$ of each outcome $Y$'. For a two-outcome case:



$$EU = (1-p) u(Y_\ell) + p u(Y_h)$$

... where $p$ is the probability of the higher income $Y_h$ and $Y_\ell$ is the lower income.

<br> <br> \bigskip

'r format_with_col("Adv:} \textcolor{gray","RawSienna")`{This framework is justified by certain 'reasonable axioms' we might expect choices under uncertainty to follow,
although these are perhaps not as readily acceptable as the main axioms of regular utility theory (like transitivity).
... e.g., the choices made under EU converge to the choices made under certainty as probabilities tend to 1.
The EU framework yields nice consistent behavior and can be reconciled with general equilibrium theory, preserving the basic welfare theorems}

***


G1: £1,000,000 with probability 0.1 and 0 with prob. 0.9

G2: £100,000 with probability 0.5 \& £50,000 with prob. 0.5

G3: £75,000 for certain


<br> <br> \bigskip

For the three gambles above:

$$EU(G_1)=0.1 \times u(1,000,000) + 0.9 \times u(0)$$
$$EU(G_2)= 0.5 \times u(100,000) + 0.5 \times u(50,000)$$
$$EU(G_3)= u(75,000)$$

<br> <br> \bigskip

If she is risk neutral, she will choose the first gamble (why?)


Ans: `r format_with_col("It has the highest expected monetary value, £100,000","brown")`

<br> <br> \bigskip

If she is risk averse, she will definitely prefer gamble 3 over gamble 2 `r format_with_col("Why?","blue")`

Ans: It has the same expected monetary value, £75,000, but involves less risk (no risk)

<br> <br> \bigskip

- If she is risk averse, she *might* prefer gamble 2 over gamble 1, but it depends *how* risk averse she is

## Risk aversion: graphical depiction

**How to illustrate this:**

- Show: $EU(gamble) = (1-p)u(x_{low}) + pu(x_{high}) < u(EV(x)) = u((1-p)x_{low} + px_{high})$

Draw a diagonal line between $u(x_{low})$ and $u(x_{high})$; the Expected Utility is in between these.


- Horizontal distance $p$ of the way between $x_{low}$ and $x_{high}$
- Project up to diagonal for average of functions (EU)

- Compare this to the vertical height of utililty function at same point $(1-p)x_{low} + px_{high}$

This is a mathematical/graphical property.


Intuition: The slope of a line tells me 'rise for a given run', the 'expectation' calculation is a linear function, so the slope is constant
and the 'share of the rise' simply projects up from the 'share of the run'

- Adverse selection
- Moral hazard
- The rationale for insurance 'deductibles'


## Ways of reducing risk: Diversification

Diversification: Buying multiple assets (with risks that are not perfectly correlated with one another)

- Putting your eggs in multiple baskets tends to reduce risk, holding expected value profit (or loss) constant!


***

### Illustration: Binomial distribution {-}

- Suppose I have £ 1000, and I can bet on fair coin flips. My returns will then have what we call a “binomial distribution”.

There is a nice illustration of binomial distributions

- If I bet all £ 1000 in a single flip, there is a 50\% chance I will lose my entire investment.
- If I bet £ 500 on two flips, there is only a 25% chance I will lose my entire investment (also reduces chance of doubling by 25\%).
    - The expected value is the same (0); thus this is better if you are risk averse.


"Less risky": B and A overlap with 0.5 probability; the remaining 50\% of time A's outcomes are more extreme. So it is less risky in a very general sense.

- If I bet £ 100 each in ten flips,  there is a 38\% chance that I will lose 20\% or more of my investment.
- If instead, I bet it on 1000 coin flips, betting £ 1 on each, there is only 6.00\% chance I will lose 5% of my investment or more, and only 1/10th of 1\% chance that I will lose 10\% of my investment or more.

<br> <br> \bigskip

*Result*: The more I can do this “diversification”, the less risk I face.



<br> <br> \bigskip


*Note*: For simplicity, these examples have a 'fair coin flip', zero expected-return investment.


<br> <br> \bigskip

But you might be wondering: 'why invest at all?
Answer: Because this principle also applies to 'unfair coin flips'.


<br> <br> \bigskip


E.g., investments in the stock market are more profitable on average than money under the mattress

Each £1 invested in shares has a higher expected return, but also a higher risk.
 However by spreading across *many different* assets we can reduce this risk, as seen above

***

### Example {-}

Suppose you have £35,000 and must invest £15,000 in an Oil company or a Transportation company

- A share in each firm costs £ 1. (Alternatively, suppose it costs £ 0.9, so on average it is profitable)

- At the end of the year there is a 50:50 chance that the share price will rise to £2 and a 50:50 chance it will fall to £ 0.

1. If you put all your money in one company there is a 50\% chance you will end up with £20,000 and a 50\% chance you end up with £ 50,000

- Your expected value is £ 35,000


2.  If you put half in each company your income has a 25\% chance of each of the following values:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("oiltransitperformance.png")
```

- Same expected value, but it is 'better'

<br> <br> \bigskip

How do we know it is better (for a risk-averse person)?

- Less risk with same EV: 50\% of the time (when oil and transit go in opposite directions) you've less gain or loss than before.

- I.e., comparing the distribution of returns to the undiversified investment:
    - 25\% of the time you gain 0 rather than gaining £ 15K (leaving you with £35k rather than £ 50k)
    - 25\% of the time you gain 0 rather than losing £ 15K  (leaving you with £ 35k rather than £ 20k)
    - The remaining 50\% of the time (when both rise or both fall) is similar to the remaining 50\% of the time under the undiversified investment


\

- See the benefit graphically (next)

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

```


*Notes:*
This depicts the average of 2 EUs (when B does poorly, when B does well)
each of which average the utility over 2 outcomes (A does poorly, A does well).
The average of the average of these exceeds the average of the utility of 2 extreme outcomes.

This takes some time to interpret; have a think about it, it is not easy.







## Flexibility and options contracts

[comment]: <> (2024BB)

2018: Less coverage of this section on 'options', less emphasized on assesment

[comment]: <> (2024EE)

- 'Keep your options open' (simple idea)

<br> <br> \bigskip

Option contract

:     Financial contract offering the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell an asset over a specified period (at a certain price).


- 'Real option': an option outside of the financial world


<br> <br> \bigskip

Attributes of options:

1. Specification of transaction: what is bought/sold, how many units maximum, at what price, etc
2. Period the option may be exercised (from when until when)
3. Price of the option

***

### Price of options determined by {-}

1. Expected value of underlying transaction (e.g., for a call option, expected future share price minus strike price)

2. Variability of the value of the transaction

Option G (a 'call option'): Right to buy Google share at £500 (£500 'strike price') in December 2020

- Worth more the higher the current share price

- If $P_{google}<£ 500$ currently, then option G is worth more the higher the expected *variability* in $P_{google}$
    - Variability can only help the option-holder:
    - price increase helps her
    - if price falls below £ 500, she doesn't need to exercise the option

`r format_with_col("Warning:","red")` If you didn't read this you probably would have guessed the opposite. On the exam, many students answer that variability *reduces* the value of the option. As you are reading this, you probably won't make that mistake... so tell your friends to read this. (2018: but this won't be focal on the exam.)

<br> <br> \bigskip

3. Duration: the longer the better -- a longer duration brings a greater chance that the price will rise above strike price (£500)

Note that the results for 'right to sell = call options' are similar, just replace the words 'buy' with 'sell' and reverse the directions ('rise' with 'fall), etc.

`r format_with_col("Q: 1. How might an airline buy options to counter its risk from rising petrol prices? 2. How could an airline pilot buy options to counter her risk of being fired in case her airline goes out of business?","blue")`


Ans: 1. The airline could buy call options (rights to buy at a price) for oil and gas company shares, or for oil and gas commodity units. 2. The pilot could buy put options (rights to sell at a price) in the airline she works for; if the airline shares become worthless these put options will be very valuable.\
Classic economist's argument: you should 'bet against yourself' to minimise risk; but this might give you bad incentives to perform. See column about this [HERE](http://www.marketplace.org/2008/08/11/business/hedging-your-bets-hard-times) ... "Hedging your bets in hard times"

```

- Different preferences for risk versus *expected* (average) return
- 'Risk' is the overall variance around the average
- Assumes 'optimal diversification': no one chooses points *below* market line

***

**Extension: "Capital asset pricing model" (CAPM)**

This is the  leading 'baseline' model in finance.

It assumes (or in fact, derives that) investors optimally diversify.

<br> <br> \bigskip

Thus assets are priced based only on 'risk that cannot be diversified away from' ('market risk')

<br> <br> \bigskip

Holding the expected value of dividends constant, assets with higher market risk are less desirable, thus priced lower, and get higher returns

The trade-off between this risk and return has a linear relationship with slope 'Beta'

<br> <br> \bigskip

-Typical economist's investment advice: diversify to mimic the 'market basket', choose funds with low fees
    - Doesn't make you a hit at parties :(

## Basic concepts (strategic interaction, elements of a game))

Previous: Each individual (consumer, firm, etc) takes all others' choices as given

- market price, demand curve, etc.

<br> <br> \bigskip

Now: Consider 'strategic interaction'

- My best choice may depend on your choice
- And vice versa
- Sequential games: My earlier choices may change your later choices



## Some examples



`r format_with_col("Is it better to get lunch at Comida or Pret?","blue")`


<br> <br> \bigskip


What if your friends are going to Comida?


<br> <br> \bigskip


What if everyone and her cousin are going to Comida, so the queue is miles long?

<br> <br> \bigskip


Does it depend on whether Samsung and LG...


... Sell their phones for £200, or £1000, or go out of business?


***

Think about:

> Find a situation in business, government, fiction, history or your own life ...

> where one party's optimal choice depends on what another party does.



*Write it down*, `r format_with_col("give 1-sentence explanation of why it involves 'strategic dependence'","gray")`

Some possible examples:

Life:

- Ask out your crush or not?


<br> <br> \bigskip


Politics:

- Country makes war or peace? Soldiers fight or run away?

- Run for office or not? Party contests a seat? If so, how much to spend on campaign?


<br> <br> \bigskip


Standard Economics:

- Amount to bid at a first-price auction?

- Whether Firezza opens a new branch in Exeter, and where?

- How hard to work towards a promotion at your job?


Very interesting problems, does Econ and Game Theory have the solutions?



### What game theory can do (wet blanket) {-}


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("Eeyore_Pink.jpg")
```

- Gives us a language and framework for analyzing strategic situations
    - 'solution concepts' make 'predictions' under given assumptions
    - 'equilibrium' defined as a baseline
- David says: Overrated as a tool for predicting how people/firms will actually behave

It often makes multiple predictions, or predicts 'mixed strategies' (randomisation).
 Real-world and experimental choices are often/arguably predicted poorly by classical game theory.
For example, standard game theory says chess has a pre-determined outcome and is a bit boring (ok, you may agree about the latter).

\textcolor{gray}{Adv: But there are complicating issues making it difficult to asses the predictions of game theory.
Particularly because monetary payoff may not be the same as utility payoffs ... this can make real-world predictions unclear.
Particularly if there are social preferences or fairness preferences.\
We also see failures to coordinate,
failure to take higher-order cognitive steps
and preferences over the *manner decisions are made*.
These make Game Theoretic predictions difficult.}

***

### Four elements describe a game {-}


1. Players
2. Strategies
3. Payoffs
4. Information


Players
:     the decision makers in the game

<br> <br> \bigskip

$2, 3, <br> <br> \bigskip,  N$ players


<br> <br> \bigskip

*Who are the players in Chicken?* 1.   The north-facing car 'North' and 2. the south-facing car 'South'

***

Strategies
:      a player’s choices in a game (at each 'decision node')

- in simple games the same as actions
- may be a plan contingent on what another player has done
- may involve randomization

<br> <br> \bigskip

*Strategies/actions in Chicken?* For both N and S, two actions -- Pull-off, Straight.

***

Payoffs

:     The utility to each player arising from the combination of each player's strategies (and chance) in the game

- May include both 'money earned' and other considerations; all this is summarised in the payoff numbers

- The goal of each player is to obtain the largest payoff that she can obtain (not just to 'win')

Note: E.g., each player prefers to get 2 in *utility* and have the other player get 8 than for both to get 1

Note: In this context it is typically not helpful to complain 'I don't think players will maximise their payoffs, because they also care about how others do, etc.' Whatever it is they care about can be expressed in the theoretical payoffs.\

However, these concerns are relevant to experiments that may incorrectly assume participants are maximising only their monetary payoffs.\



***

*Payoffs in chicken?*


- Both pull-off $\rightarrow$  Tie


- N Straight, S pulls off $\rightarrow$ N 'wins', S 'loses'

- N pulls off, S straight $\rightarrow$ N 'loses', S 'wins'


- Both straight $\rightarrow$ crash




*To convey this game* payoffs must follow: Win $\succ$ tie  $\succ$ lose $\succ$ crash

***


Example of payoffs in Chicken (as matrix)

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llcc}
                              & \multicolumn{3}{l}{Northern}                                                                  \\ \cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{}         & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{}          & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Pull-off} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Straight} \\ \cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Southern} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Pull-off} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{0,0}       & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{-1,1}    \\ \cline{2-4}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}


***


Information

:     what each player knows, at a particular point in the game, about payoffs and previous actions

- For *sequential* games, players may or may not know other players' previous actions

(in this module we will only cover the case where they *do* know previous actions taken)




## Illustrating Games

### The Prisoners’ Dilemma: Normal form {-}

*The original story*:
Two individuals are arrested for a crime.  They both know that they can only be convicted for a lesser crime, for which they get 2 years in jail.
DA (Chief Crown Prosecutor) puts them in separate rooms and offers each the same deal.
If you confess and your partner stays quiet you will only get 1 year in jail and they will get 10 years.
If you both confess you will each get 3 years.


What would you do? What would most people do? What does game theory predict?

<br> <br> \bigskip

Which *outcome* is *definitely NOT* Pareto-optimal (for the prisoners)?


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pd_normal.png")
```

- Normal form payoff matrix (also called 'matrix form')

- Payoff convention: listed in the order (row's payoffs, column's payoffs)

<br> <br> \bigskip

**A Prisoner's Dilemma be like**



Two Players: (A and B, row and column, whatever)


Strategies (Actions): 'Cooperate' (C) or defect (D)


In normal form:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llcc}
                              & \multicolumn{3}{l}{Player 2}                                                                  \\ \cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{}         & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{}          & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Cooperate} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Defect} \\ \cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Player 1} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Cooperate} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{R,R}       & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{S,T}    \\ \cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{}         & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Defect}    & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{T,S}       & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{P,P}    \\ \cline{2-4}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


To be a prisoner's dilemma game the payoffs must satisfy $T > R > P > S$

I.e., Temptation $>$ Reward $>$ Punishment $>$ Sucker



### The Prisoners’ Dilemma: Extensive form {-}

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pd_extensive.png")
```

- Above: oval (usually dashed lines) for 'information set'
    - B may 'move second' but he doesn't know A's move (which side he is on), so it's as if simultaneous
- Order only matters if you observe earlier action
- Typically:  extensive form for sequential games,  normal form for simultaneous games

*Note:* `r format_with_col("This fancy terminology seems confusing and unnecessary.  The reason for it involves more formal definitions of 'extensive' and 'normal' games and some deeper technical issues that we skip here.","gray")`

***



**Common knowledge**

- What all players know, and
- all players know that all other players know,
- and all players know that all other players know that all other players know,
- and all players know that all other players know that all other players know that all other players know,

 etc.

Note: By the way, we always assume that the rules of the game are common knowledge.


***

Why is common knowledge important?

```

***

- Island with 1000 people.
    - 100 of them have blue eyes, 900 have brown eyes
    - There are no reflective surfaces
- By custom or law:
    - He who know own eye colour must commit suicide the next day in the town square
    - No one can discuss another person's eye colour.
- American tourist visits, says "It’s so nice to see one or more people with blue eyes in this part of the world”.

<br> <br> \bigskip


Q: *What effect, if any, does this faux pas have on the island?*

Ans: If his statement is 'common knowledge'

then all 100 blue-eyed people will kill themselves on day 100 after the speech.



***

A's *Best Response* (BR) to strategy *S*:

:     A strategy for player A that gives him the highest payoff of all his possible strategies, given that the other player(s) play *S*

Note: The BR is a function of the others' strategies *S*; it may take a different value for each strategy the others play.

## Dominant, dominated strategies and rationalizability

*Note: Iterated strict dominance and rationalizability are NOT covered in the text, but I want you to learn it.  As a prediction it is much easier to justify than Nash Equilibrium.*

<br> <br> \bigskip

Dominant strategy
:     A single strategy that is a best response to *any* of the other player’s strategies.

- A simple prediction: a 'rational' player will play a dominant strategy, if she has one.


Dominated strategy (not in text!)
:     Strategy A is dominated by strategy B if B yields higher payoffs for *any* of the other player’s strategies

- A simple prediction: a rational player will *never* play a dominated strategy

*Why?*: because a dominated strategy  cannot be optimal for *any* belief about what the other player(s) will do



<br> <br> \bigskip

*Note:* With only two strategies to choose from these concepts are the same.
With more than two, if there is a Dominant strategy this means that all other strategies are dominated by it. We see this in examples below.

***

- Prediction of 'players play dominant strategies'
    - in Prisoner's dilemma


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pd_normal.png")
```
    - In general, this may have no clear prediction

***

 knitr::include_graphics("matrixforISD.png")
```

`r format_with_col("Consider","blue")`: What does 'players play dominant strategies' predict above? What about 'players never play dominated strategies'?

***


### Rationalisability/ Iterated strict dominance (not in text!) {-}

Extending this ...

\underline{Rationality assumption:} the players are rational.

We know rational players will not play dominated strategies
The players *themselves* know this.

<br> <br> \bigskip

\underline{Common Knowledge of Rationality assumption:}

The players know all other players are rational. The players know all players know all players are rational.  The players know (all players know … ad infinitum) all players are rational.

- Thus the players know what the other players will never do, and eliminate these from consideration
- The players will not play a strategy if another strategy is always better against this reduced set of possibilities
- Etc.

This process is called 'Iterated Strict Dominance' (ISD) We will call strategies that survive ISD **'rationalizable' strategies**

`r format_with_col("Adv: There are differences between 'rationalizable' and 'survives ISD' but for our purposes these are the same","RawSienna")`

```

## Equilibrium

Market equilibrium (review): given the equilibrium price and quantity, no market participant has an incentive to change his or her behaviour.


<br> <br> \bigskip


In strategic settings, a similar concept:

Nash equilibrium (NE)
:     A set of *strategies*, one for each player, that are best responses against one another


- If I play my BR to your chosen strategy and you're playing your BR to mine, neither of us has an incentive to deviate --- an equilibrium.

- All games have at least one Nash equilibrium
    - But it may be an equilibrium in 'mixed strategies' (involving randomisation)

- Caveat: we might not expect such play to actually occur (particularly not in one-shot games)


`r format_with_col("In fact, 2-player games will have an *odd* number of equilibria; you can see this by looking at the crosses of the BR functions","gray")`


## Two ways to find the Nash equilibrium (NE)


1. Inspection: Check each outcome one by one. See if either player has an incentive to *unilaterally* deviate.  If not, it’s an equilibrium.


<br> <br> \bigskip


2. Underline method: For each player underline the payoff he would get if he played his best response to each of the other player’s actions. Any outcome where there are *two* underlines is *the outcome of* an equilibrium strategy profile.

[comment]: <> (2024BB)
\textcolor{gray}{Caveat: this only works in a game with a countable set of actions ... a 'matrix' game,
If the actions are a continuous variable (e.g., price, quantity) you must solve for point(s) where these functions meet,
2018: we will not cover games with continuous action spaces}

[comment]: <> (2024EE)


Note this is the same 'prediction' as dominant strategies, but the interpretations are different;
This is not by accident, there is a general result...

Recall again that the NE, and the prediction of 'players play dominant strategies' (also 'rationalisability')
yields the single outcome that is clearly NOT pareto optimal. Lesson  group and individual interests don't always align

***


Find equilibrium via each method:


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pd_normal.png")
```


## Relationship between dominant strategies, rationalisability, and Nash equilibrium

- If eliminating dominated strategies yields a single prediction for each player, these strategies are a Nash equilibrium.

- Same holds for eliminating by iteration (rationalizability) ... if it leads to a unique prediction, it's a NE.

- But not every Nash equilibrium involves dominant strategies


## Efficiency and the PD (redux)

*Lesson: The group interests and individual interests do not always align*

- If the players were allowed to communicate what would seem to be the best outcome?
- Both staying silent would be better for both than the outcome in the NE: 2 yrs vs. 3 yrs

    - But binding agreements are not allowed, and communication should not help

## Coordination and anti-coordination games


### Coordination: Battle of the sexes (BOS) {-}

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("bosmatrix.png")
```


- to make it more PC, assume it is a very violent ballet and a very gentle boxing match

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("matchpennies.png")
```


Note:  Underline best responses, show no pure strategy NE here


## Mixed strategies

[comment]: <> (2024BB)

*Note:* Please know the basic principles; you don't need to \underline{compute} mixed strategies*

[comment]: <> (2024EE)

Pure strategy
:     Consists of a single action played with certainty

<br> <br> \bigskip

Mixed strategy
:     Assigns a probability to each possible action

<br> <br> \bigskip

*Remember: there is always at least one NE. If there is no pure strategy NE, there will be a NE in mixed strategies.*

***

### Matching pennies: mixed strategies {-}

\underline{Intuition}

If you choose heads/tails half the time then I'm indifferent between heads or tails. Thus, choosing heads half the time is *among* my best responses.

If I choose heads half the time then you're indifferent between heads/tails. Thus choosing heads half the time is *among* your best responses

So, technically, each of us choosing heads half the time is a NE. `r format_with_col("(But it is called a 'weak' NE because either of us would do no *worse* if he deviated alone)","gray")`

***

### Battle of sexes: mixed strategies {-}

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("bosmatrix.png")
```

*Note:* Wife wants to end up at the same place as her husband but doesn’t know where he is going.\
- If she believes that he will always go to the ballet she should always go to the ballet.\
- If she believes he will always go boxing, she should go boxing.\
- What other beliefs may she have?

We want to derive the best response functions, and find the intersection(s) of these.

Let $h$ represent the probability husband chooses Ballet


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("bosmatrix.png")
```

**Wife's BR:**

- Wife chooses Ballet iff her Expected payoff of Ballet > Expected payoff of Boxing

<br> <br> \bigskip


I.e., $2h > 1- h$, i.e, $h > 1/3$

- Thus, wife goes to Ballet if she believes husband goes to Ballet more than 1/3 of the time
    - If she thinks he goes below 1/3 of the time she goes to Boxing
    - If she thinks he goes *exactly* 1/3 of the time she is indifferent


***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("bosbr1.png")
```

*Note:* This plots the value of w that best responds to h;\ the probability the wife goes Ballet given the probability the husband goes Boxing.

***

Let w: probability wife chooses Ballet

**Husband's BR:**

<br> <br> \bigskip


- Husband chooses Ballet iff his Expected payoff of Ballet > Expected payoff of Boxing
    - 1w > 2- 2w
    - w > 2/3


- Thus, husband goes ballet if he believes wife goes Ballet more than 2/3 of the time
    - If he thinks she goes less than 2/3 of the time he goes Boxing
    - If she thinks he goes *exactly* 2/3 of the time he is indifferent


***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("bosbr2.png")
```


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("bosbr3.png")
```


*Shortcut:* only someone who is indifferent will randomise. Above, $h=1/3$ makes wife indifferent, $w=2/3$ makes husband indifferent


### What's all this rot? {-}

- Mixed strategies are not about 'being unpredictable'; these are one shot games

'r format_with_col("Some texts and authors make this point about 'unpredictability' but others disagree (including myself). Making sure that it is impossible to predict your later play from your previous is only important if you are playing the same game repeatedly, and being observed.","RawSienna}{Adv:} \textcolor{gray")`

'r format_with_col("Adv:} \textcolor{gray","RawSienna")`{It makes a bit more sense if we think about 'populations.
Suppose in a population 1/3 of men go to Ballet and 2/3 of women go to Ballet:
... these ratios are 'stable'; no reason for systematic changes.
On the other hand, if men always went to boxing and women to ballet this is not stable. A husband would be better off going to ballet ... so the ratios should change over time.}

### Computing payoffs with mixing {-}

- Remember, formally NE specifies *strategies* (strategy 'profiles') not payoffs
    - In the BOS the pure strategy equilibria were
        - i. Husband: Boxing, Wife: Boxing
        - ii. Husband: Ballet, Wife: Ballet
    - the mixed-strategy NE was:
        - iii. Husband: go Ballet with probability h=1/3, Wife: Go Ballet with prob w=2/3.
    - The *payoffs* to these were, respectively
        i. Husband: 2, Wife: 1
        ii. Husband: 1, Wife: 2
        iii. ...


Payoff to the mixed strategy:

- Payoffs are utilities, sum utility of each outcome $\times$ probability of that outcome
    - Prob(Both go Ballet) = $w \times h = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$
    - Prob(Both go Boxing) = $(1-w)(1-h) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$
    - Prob(Wife Ballet, Husband Boxing) = $w(1-h) = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{9}$
    - Prob(Wife Boxing, Husband Ballet) = $(1-w)(h) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$

<br> <br> \bigskip

Thus, under the mixed strategy NE play:

$$U_{husb} =  \frac{2}{9} \times 1 +  \frac{2}{9} \times 2 +  \frac{4}{9} \times 0 + \frac{1}{9} \times 0 = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$$
$$U_{wife} = \frac{2}{3}$$

- (Wife's payoff inferred from symmetry of problem or similarly calculated)


## How do you solve a problem like multiple-equilibria?

<br> <br> \bigskip


Above (BOS), there are three equilibria: both play Boxing, both play Ballet, and the mixed strategy

- Are any of these more reasonable as predicted outcomes?

### Multiple equilibrium and refinements {-}

We refer to *refinement criteria* and *focal points*. For example...

1. 'Choose the equilibrium with the highest payoffs for both?'  In BOS this rules out mixing (payoffs 2/3, 2/3 for h,w respectively).
But it doesn't say whether we should predict Box, Box (payoffs 2,1) or Ballet, Ballet (payoffs 1,2)

2. Choose the 'symmetric equilibrium?' ... here, mixing

3. Choose the one that seems like a 'focal point'? (remember the 'big game')


***

### Is there a focal point? {-}

## Sequential Games

[comment]: <> (2024BB)

Note: don't worry about the 'normal form' of sequential games; we will only use the extensive form for these

[comment]: <> (2024EE)

- How does the Battle of Sexes game change if Wife chooses first, Husband observes her choice, and then he chooses
    - What do you think will happen? Vote (clickers):
        - A. Wife: Ballet, Husband: Box
        - B. Wife: Ballet, Husband: Ballet
        - C. Wife: Box, Husband: Ballet
        - D. Wife: Box, Husband: Box

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("BOS_sequential.png")
```

*Note:* Remember, it's a one-shot game ... unrealistic within a marriage of course


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("BOS_sequential.png")
```

- The wife has two strategies: Ballet or Boxing
- The husband has four contingent strategies, but we focus on what he will do in each of his two possible 'decision nodes'


*Notes:*
Here we see there is a 'first-mover advantage'. \

We see a very similar strategic concern in other contexts, including 'which firm enters a market first'. Suppose that if two firms are in a market there will be a price war with consumers as well as a bidding up of input prices and salaries,  and both will lose money. Perhaps by being the first firm to enter I 'scare off the other firm' and I can keep the profits. The other firm may 'threaten to enter' but that would seem to be a non-credible threat! On the other hand, suppose that I know that if I enter first the other firm can 'learn from my mistakes' and free-ride off my innovation. Here we would have a 'second-mover advantage'; but in such a game a BWI may lead to the outcome 'neither firm enters'!

\

These concerns also apply to politics, and the games can of course include multiple players

- Cameron's decision to allow a referendum, followed by politician's (Boris etc) decisions to choose a side?

- May's negotiations with the EU (Barnier), followed by the parliament's 'meaningful vote', followed by ??

- US Supreme court fight over Brett Kavanaugh, the sequential decisions of the last 'swing' senators

***


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("BOS_sequential.png")
```

Proper subgame
:     Part of the game tree including an initial decision not connected to another (in an oval or dashed lines) and everything branching out below it.

- I.e., each 'game' starting from a point where a player knows where he is (knows previous choices)


*Notes:*
SPNE via backwards induction -- essentially requires that each player would act optimally at each of these points

***

Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE)
:     Strategies that form a Nash equilibrium on every proper subgame.

- You can solve for this with 'backwards induction' (BWI)
    - Solve for best move for last decision node (proper subgame)
        - Given these, solve for best response for previous decision node
        - Etc.

***

Example: BWI for BOS


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("bosbwi1.png")
```


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("bosbwi2.png")
```


Note that the SPNE in a sequential game always involves 'best responses'. I think this makes SPNE more credible as a prediction in sequential games than NE in simultaneous games.


***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("bosbwi1.png")
```

*Formally specify (SP)NE strategies for above game:*

NE, not SP: \{Wife: Boxing; Husband: Boxing, Boxing\}

SPNE:  \{Wife: Ballet; Husband: Ballet, Boxing\}


*(reading Husband's decision nodes left to right; please specify this)*


***

**It can get fancier**

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("longgamework_randompayoffs_noul.png")
```


*Note: you can 'build these games' on \url{http://gte.csc.liv.ac.uk/gte/builder/} if you like*

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("longgamework_randompayoffs_ul.png")
```

***

In 'normal' (matrix form), stating complete contingent strategies:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("longgame_matrix_full.png")
```


<br> <br> \bigskip

And the 'abbreviated strategies'; leaving out decision nodes ruled out by a player's own previous choices as specified in the strategy:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("longgame_matrix_abbrev.png")
```


***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("longgamework_randompayoffs_ul.png")
```

The SPNE; 'state the complete contingent strategies'

A: S1, N3, N5

B: s2, n4, n6

## Experimental evidence: What is a laboratory experiment in Economics?

E.g., FEELE lab at Exeter

- Real incentives (typically small)
- Typically student subject pool
- No deception protocol

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("ztreePD.png")
```

***

### Various experimental goals {-}

- Measure preferences (risk, time, social preferences...)
- Asses theoretical predictions (classical and behavioural), including game theory
    - Also see 'likely' outcomes where theory has no prediction or predicts multiple equilibria
    - *Critical* to assert 'control' over payoffs for this
- Understand cognitive processes in economic realm
- 'Test' institutions and mechanisms (e.g., auctions, markets)

## Laboratory evidence 1: Prisoners' dilemmas

Cooper et al (1996)

- Players cooperated even in anonymous 'one-shot' games (different opponents each time)
- Cooperation declines somewhat over time, but not to zero
- Mix of other-regarding and selfish types

*Notes:* Results are similar for experiments involving contributions to public goods.some cooperation, declining over time but not to zero, and a mix of players who never contribute and many 'reciprocal' types.

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("cooperPD.png")
```

## Laboratory evidence 2: Ultimatum game
- Proposer goes first, proposes a split of the 'pie', anything between 0\%-100\% and 100\%-0\% inclusive.
- Responder can accept or reject and get nothing


Q: What does SPNE predict (use backwards induction)?


Ans: It predicts the proposal offers the lowest (positive) amount and the responder accepts


<br> <br> \bigskip


What happens in experiments?

- 50-50 split is the most common offer
- Responders tend to reject offers giving them less than 30\%, even when this is a lot of money


Potential explanations

- Fairness concerns; monetary payoffs may not represent actual payoffs
- Proposers may anticipate this



## Issues in lab experiments

### What is being measured? {-}
- PD: Does money measure the true payoffs? Do we have the 'control' to test the model?
    - Other-regarding preferences; may be unobservable.
    - 'Experimenter demand': desire to please experimenter, aware of study goals?


## Issues in lab experiments: External generalisability
- Relevance of subject-pool (participants)
    - Do they resemble the 'real world' group of interest? (e.g., firms, countries, taxpayers, voters, home-buyers)
    - Right preferences and experience?
- Relevance of environment
    - Are the (small) stakes relevant?
    - Are the right 'environmental characteristics' present?
    - Does the 'imposed model' apply?
    - Observed self-conscious environment, perhaps made aware of contrasts

Teens A and B are smitten with each other but neither knows of the other’s feelings. Suppose the teachers at their school organize a dance.  The “payoff” is based on whether their advances are rebuffed or accepted.  If they both Declare,  they get positive utility but if they are Rebuffed they face humiliation (significantly negative payoff).  Rebuffing an advance slightly elevates the teen’s standing with peers.

# Behavioural economics [1-2 hours] (week 12)

## Behavioural economics


- Covers selected parts of NS: Ch 17, plus supplements


- `r format_with_col("Eighth problem set: Behavioural economics","blue")`


Thou shalt be carefully sceptical; critique do not just criticise;
Consider the assumptions made; Consider the evidence

## Neoclassical versus Behavioural economics


*(Neo)classical:*

- Firms maximise profit
- Individuals/households have a consistent utility function which they act 'rationally' to maximise
    - Mainly: focused on *own* consumption,  ignores 'cognitive costs', ignores 'malleable and changing preferences'


*Notes:*
\textcolor{gray}{We can not say someones *preferences* are irrational, only that either \
they are not acting optimally to maximize their welfare *given* these preferences or \
their preferences are not internally consistent (e.g., not-transitive), are not fully self-interested (altruism), \
 or are otherwise difficult to model (e.g., depending on the *manner* they make choices and not only the outcomes.}

***

Classical economics assumes

- Optimization of a consistent ‘normal’ utility function subject to  known constraints
    - Only own consumption matters?
    - No cost to gather information or make calculations?

<br> <br> \bigskip

Expected utility over gambles/investments, probabilities accurately known

<br> <br> \bigskip

Geometric discounting of future payoffs with a single (or at least a consistent) discount rate



Adv: E.g., if $\delta=0.1$ in each period then next period's payoff of 100 is worth as much as $(1-0.1) \times 100 = 90$  today. \
A payoff of 100 in two periods is worth as much as $(1-0.1) \times 100 = 90$ tomorrow, or as much as $(1-0.1) \times (1-0.1)\times 100 = 81$ today.

<br> <br> \bigskip


Strategic behaviour in interactions
- Common knowledge of rationality, Nash equilibrium?

***

We can find behaviour and outcomes that seem to contradict the above assumptions.

\

This 'non-classical' behaviour is (arguably) common, significant, and follows predictable patterns


Should we then *stop learning classical economics?*

***


## Classical economists are not naïve

They know preferences change, people make mistakes, etc.

Justifications include:

- ‘Most people, most of the time,’ and many mistakes will be ‘fixed’ by the market.
- Strong predictive power
- 'Normative':  how we 'should' behave to get the best outcomes
- A good starting point, framework for insight, benchmark

***

## Behavioural Economics

Relaxes some of the assumptions above, usually one at a time

<br> <br> \bigskip

Does not typically 'reject rationality' ('bounded rationality')


<br> <br> \bigskip

Most “behavioral models” involve some sort of optimization (and often equilibrium)
- There are ‘pure behavioral theorists’ who try to find parsimonious models to explain deviations

*Most influential authors: Kahneman and Tversky*

***

## Modern consensus/entente

Both classical and behavioural economics are useful

- Different models and techniques (for different spheres?)

*Notes:* \textcolor{gray}{It is worth testing for, and admitting the possibility of 'systematic violations' of the classical assumptions.
*Classical* economics is usually more relevant for firm behavior
But Classical may (or may not) predict well for *aggregates* and for *firm behaviour* \
*Behavioural models* may predict better for individual behaviour in isolation \
but behavioural admits many possibilities and heterogeneous behavior, so it makes broad predictions difficult \
Behavioural insights are (probably) useful in making policy (and in marketing) \
Evidence from the lab may be informative, but some 'behavioural anomalies' may be inconsequential in larger markets in equilibrium}


## Limits to Human Decision Making: An Overview

There are four general ways people diverge from classical assumptions (text says three)

1. Limited cognitive ability – difficult and costly to make complex decisions

2. Limited willpower – self control problems

3. Limited self interest – care about others (fairness, altruism), issues beyond income/consumption

4. Inconsistent, changing, and 'non-outcome-based' preferences



\textcolor{gray}{DR: I added this final one to the textbook's account; under (e.g.) Prospect Theory people may be acting to maximise their true preferences, \
 but their true preferences may change depending on reference points etc.}

## Limited cognitive ability

- Complexity of problems
    - Optimising calculations take time; this may *itself* be a cost
        - A 'simplifying decision-making rule' (rule-of-thumb) may be better if it saves these costs
    - Relevant both to individual decision-making (consumption, investment) and strategic choices
        - Game theory: recall 'iterated strict dominance' and 'backwards induction'

- People (seem to) systematically misunderstand probabilities (and other maths concepts)

***

### Application: lack of financial literacy {-}

- Consumers who underestimated interest rates in quizzes held the highest interest loans in real life
- Particularly when government 'truth in lending laws' were lax


*Evidence from Stango and Zinman, 2011*

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("paydayloan.png")
```


***

1. Suppose you had £100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2\% per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow: 

\

A. More than £102
\

B. Exactly £102
\

- Consumers who underestimated interest rates in quizzes held the highest interest loans in real life (Stango and Zinman, 2011)
        - Particularly when government 'truth in lending laws' were lax


<br> <br> \bigskip

2. Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1\% per year and inflation was 2\% per year. After 1 year, would you be able to buy:

\

A. more than
\

B. exactly the same as, or 
\

C. less than today 

<br> <br> \bigskip

3.  Do you think that the following statement is true or false? ‘Buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.’ 

(True/False)


\medskip

Around the world, across many studies, less than half answer *all three* correctly.
Lusardi and Mitchell, 2013; In Germany and Switzerland, just over 50\% get all three right.  In most other surveyed countries, the numbers are far lower.  E.g., in the USA 65\% get the interest rate question right, 64\% the inflation question, and 52\% the diversification question.

## Allais paradox

- Gamble A: an 89\% chance of winning £1 million, a 10\% chance of winning £5 million, and a 1\% chance of winning nothing.
- Gamble B: £1 million with certainty.

<br> <br> \bigskip

*Write down: which would you choose?*

\hrulefill

<br> <br> \bigskip

**Scenario 2. Which would you choose?**

- Gamble C: an 89\% chance of winning nothing and an 11\% chance of winning £ 1 million.
- Gamble D: a 90\% chance of winning nothing and a 10\% chance of winning £5 million.

<br> <br> \bigskip

*Which would you choose?*


***

Many people choose B over A and choose D over C:

$$B \succ A $$

$$ £1m \succ  (£ 1m \otimes 0.89 + £ 5m \otimes 0.1 + £0 \otimes 0.01)$$
$$D \succ C $$
$$(£ 0 \otimes 0.9 +  £ 5m \otimes 0.10) \succ (£ 0 \otimes 0.89 + £ 1m \otimes 0.11) $$

i.e.,

$$ £ 1k \succ  (£ 1k \otimes 0.89 + £ 5k \otimes 0.1 + £0 \otimes 0.01)$$
\


<br> <br> \bigskip

*But this contradicts Expected Utility theory:*

- If $B \succ A$ then $EU(A) > EU(B)$
    - $\rightarrow u(1m) > 0.89 \: u(1m) + 0.1 \: u(5m) + 0.01 \: u(0)$
    - $\rightarrow$ $0.11 \: u(1m) >  0.1 u(5m) + 0.01 \: u(0)$
- If $D \succ C$ then $EU(D)>EU(C)$
    - $\rightarrow 0.9 \: u(0) + 0.1 u(5m) > 0.89 \: u(0) + 0.11 \: u(1m)$
    - Implying $0.1 \: u(5m) + 0.01 \: u(0) > 0.11 \: u(1m)$
    - Contradicting the above!



*Note there is a 'reversal':*
In choosing B over A you gave up a 10\% chance of £5000 to get a 1\% greater chance of £1000 \
... but in choosing D over C you gave up a 1\% greater chance of £1000 to get a 10\% change of £5000



\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: By EU theory it shouldn't matter that for the remaining 89\% of the time A differs from C: \
This is an 'independent state of the world'; should have no impact on your decisions for the remaining 11\% of the time. \
By this logic, the fact that there is a 10\% chance that a meteor destroys England on Friday should not affect my choice \
of whether to go to a fancy restaurant or get a simple curry on Friday in the 90\% probability case that England is *not* hit.}

<br> <br> \bigskip

**Explaining it again with pie charts...**

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("allaispies.png")
```

\medskip

\footnotesize{A is D plus an additional  89\% chance of £1m}

<br> <br> \bigskip

\footnotesize{B is C plus an additional 89\% chance of £1m}

<br> <br> \bigskip

\footnotesize{So "A and B" are "D and C" with \underline{additional 89\% chance of £ 1m}}


<br> <br> \bigskip

\footnotesize{EU additive} $\rightarrow$: \footnotesize{choice for *remaining* 11\% state ignores \underline{difference}}

By the EU calculation I make choices over which I prefer for the (remaining)
 11% of the time without considering what happens 89% of the time. 'Independent states of the world'.



**SO WHY do people choose B over A and D over C?**

- One theory: People overweight small probabilities
    - $\rightarrow$  Gamble A: the 1\% chance of 0 is treated as larger?

***

### Kahneman and Tversky scenariae {-}

`r format_with_col("Warning: This is not the standard Allais paradox, it is a different paradox.","red")`

**KT1. Which would you choose?** \

You get £1000 upfront. \

- Gamble $A: You have an 50\% chance of winning an additional £$1,000.

- Gamble $B: An additional £$500 with certainty.

*Write down: which would you choose?*

**KT1. Which would you choose?** \

You get £2000 upfront. \

- Gamble $C$: You have an 50\% chance of losing £1,000.

\hrulefill




**KT1:** You get £1000 upfront. \


- Gamble $A$: You have an 50\% chance of winning an additional £1,000.

- Gamble $B$: An additional £500 with certainty.


\hrulefill

**KT1:** You get £2000 upfront. \

- Gamble $C$: You have an 50\% chance of losing £1,000.

- Gamble $D$: Lose £500 with certainty.

<br> <br> \bigskip


\hrulefill

KT (hypothetical) experiment: 16\% of subjects chose $A$ over $B$, and 68\% chose $C$ over $D$

- *But $A$ is the same as $C$ (50/50 chance of £1000 or £2000),*
- *and $B$ is the same as $D$ (certain £1500)!*

Seems to depend on how we 'frame' these.

## Explaining the above paradoxes with prospect theory

- Above choices: cannot be explained by 'regular' EU theory
    - Mistakes, misunderstanding probabilities?
    - Prospect theory, loss-aversion: *not* mistakes, but maximising something other than EU

***


### Prospect theory -- loss aversion (LA) part {-}

1. People don't think only about *outcomes* but about 'gains or losses relative to a reference point'
1. Outcomes considered *losses* are particular painful
1. Whether an outcome is a *loss* depends on the reference point
    - which may depend on how a decision is framed
    - or on the starting point, or initial expectations


<br> <br> \bigskip

$\rightarrow$ may make decisions to 'avoid losses' \
that we wouldn't make if we saw it as 'increasing gains'

***

### Standard and loss-averse utility {-}

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("std_u_prospect_u.png")
```


*Notes:*
What leads to the paradoxes and 'inconsistent behaviour'? \
 The fact that the reference point can vary depending on things that are 'irrelevant' from an EU perspective



***

### KT experiment with prospect theory (loss aversion) {-}

**KT1:** £1000 upfront. \

- Gamble $A$: You have an 50\% chance of winning an additional £1,000.
- Gamble $B$: An additional £500 with certainty.

<br> <br> \bigskip

\hrulefill

**KT2:** £2000 upfront. \

- Gamble $C$: You have an 50\% chance of losing £1,000.
- Gamble $D$: You lose £500 with certainty.


\hrulefill

<br> <br> \bigskip

- In KT1, your reference point may be £1000.
    - Choose between A---a small certain gain and B---a larger uncertain gain; with same EV
    - ... standard risk aversion predicts choosing B
- In KT1, your reference point may be £2000.
    - Choose between C---a possible large loss and D---a certain smaller loss (with same EV)
    - ... standard risk aversion predicts choosing D
    - But if feeling of *loss* is very painful, may choose C>D to have a 50\% chance of avoiding pain


*Note:* This may help explain why some problem gamblers incur larger and larger losses to try to 'make up' for bad performance earlier in the day.

***

Framing effect
:     The same choice, presented in two different ways, may lead to different decisions.

***

### Allais redux: loose prospect theory (Loss Aversion) explanation {-}

*Note:* We previously mentioned misweighting probabilities as an explanation for this. \
 An alternative explanation could be loss-aversion

- A: 89\% chance of £1,000, a 10\% chance of £5,000, 1\% chance of 0.
- B: £1,000 with certainty.
- C: 89\% chance of 0 and 11\% chance of £1,000.
- D: 90\% chance of 0 and 10\% chance of £5,000.

<br> <br> \bigskip

- Considering A \& B, the ref. point may be close to £1000, as this can be had with certainty.
    -  A seem to 'risk a costly loss of £1000', thus may choose 'safer' $B>A$, notwithstanding its far lower EV (£1000 vs £1390)

<br> <br> \bigskip


- Considering D \& C, ref. point may be close to 0, as EV's of each are low, \& 0 is likeliest outcome
    - So 'don't worry about losses', choose D > C bc higher EV (£500 vs. £110)

## Limited willpower and 'hyperbolic discounting'


2019-20: We will cover this only very briefly because of time limitations

[Marshmallow test](https://youtu.be/d8M7Xzjy_m8?t=3)

*Notes:*
In the 1960's-70's Stanford experiment. Children could have 1 marshmallow now or 2 in 15 minutes if they could resist temptation. \
There is some evidence that this correlates to later life outcomes (test scores, degrees, BMI, etc). \
Strong results; interpretation debated.

`r format_with_col("This result is now in question!","red")` The strongest results have failed to replicate. See a popular discussion [here](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/6/17413000/marshmallow-test-replication-mischel-psychology).

<br> <br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("Similarly, Tuesday-David won't give up 1 marshmallow for 2 on Wednesday","brown")`

<br> <br> \bigskip

- Inconsistency: Monday-David thinks Tuesday-David is acting sub-optimally!
    - Is David acting in his own interest? Can we even define his 'true utility'?

***

Hyperbolic discounting (simple version)
:     Steep drop in 'weight $w$' on payoffs earned after the current period

<br> <br> \bigskip

- But constant weight (or constant discounting) for payoffs multiple periods in the future
    - This leads to inconsistencies between 'planned' and chosen behaviour

***

Compare two 'streams of payoffs'

\

1. Work: -10 today, +2 for the next 6 days

2. Lazy: -5 today, +1 for next 6 days


*Examples:* Should you...?

study very hard on Sunday to be prepared for the whole week, \
Get a good workout to feel energized the whole week \
Clean your flat on Sunday .... etc.

<br> <br> \bigskip

Grasshopper weights payoffs today, tomorrow, and every day the same: $w=1$

- Monday, Grasshopper compares Work to Lazy, and chooses Work.
    - payoff(Work) $= -10 + (2 \times 6) = 2$
    - payoff(Lazy) $= -5 + (1 \times 6) = 1$

<br> <br> \bigskip

Ant always weights payoffs at 1 today and $w=1/2$ on any future day

- Monday, Ant chooses Lazy:
    - payoff(Work) $= -10 +(2 \times 6)/2 = -4$
    - payoff(Lazy) $= -5 + (1 \times 6)/2 = -2$

<br> <br> \bigskip

If Grasshopper were 'choosing for Monday on Sunday', he would choose Work $\rightarrow$ Consistent

<br> <br> \bigskip

But if Ant were 'choosing for Monday on Sunday', he would choose Work $\rightarrow$ Inconsistent

<br> <br> \bigskip

- On Sunday he considers
    - payoff(Work Monday) $= (-10 + 2 \times 6)/2 = 1$
    - payoff(Lazy Monday) $= (-5 + 1 \times 6)/2 = 1/2$
- But as we saw, on Monday he chooses to be lazy
- Would he 'benefit from pre-committing?'


### Application: 'put a contract out on yourself {-}


## Altruism and fairness

'Other-regarding preferences':  My utility may be impacted by...

- Other people's utility, or their consumption of particular 'merit' goods
    - E.g., I suffer if I know my neighbour suffers, or her child eats too little
    - $\rightarrow$ 'aid to the poor' may become a public good; may be massively under-provided in a voluntary setting

- My perceived 'impact' on outcomes
    - If I donate to charity, I feel better
    - If my contribution improves people's lives, protects the environment (relative to my having done nothing)
    - $\rightarrow$ People may make choices reducing their own consumption, to increase other's consumption
    - Charitable giving is widespread; accounts for about 1\% of UK GDP
    - 'Donations' to family members much higher



'r format_with_col("The utilities, and decisions, of family members are highly connected. There is an ongoing debate and research programme considering when to model a household's decisions as 'unitary' and when to consider the individual preferences of the household members.","RawSienna}{Adv:} \textcolor{gray")`

***

... 'Other-regarding preferences':  My utility may be impacted by...

- My reputation and how others perceive me
    - $\rightarrow$ People may donate  and cooperate more when observed

- How 'fair' I believe the outcomes and actions taken are
    - $\rightarrow$ People reject significant positive offers in ultimatum games and bargaining
        - Anticipating this, people make offers considerably above zero
    - $\rightarrow$ People cooperate when they expect others to do so
    - $\rightarrow$ people engage in 'costly punishment' of others they believe acted unfairly

***


### Converting from 'material payoffs' to 'psychological payoffs' {-}

- As noted, the 'real' payoffs in a game (or an individual decision) may not be identical to the monetary/material payoffs
    - (Note, this is a separate point than 'diminishing marginal utility' and risk-aversion)

- Motives like 'fairness' may transform monetary payoffs into 'real' payoffs in a straightforward way
    - E.g., in the ultimatum game, suppose player 1's real payoffs are:

<br> <br> \bigskip


$$U_1(Y_1,Y_2) = Y_1 - |Y_1-Y_2|$$


<br> <br> \bigskip


Where $Y_1$ is the amount 1 earns from the ultimatum game, and $Y_2$ is 2's income from this game.


<br> <br> \bigskip


Similarly for player 2:


$$U_2(Y_2,Y_1) = Y_2 - |Y_1-Y_2|$$


<br> <br> \bigskip


*Here each player gains 1 unit of utility for each pound they earn, but loses a unit of utility for every pound of difference between the payoffs.*



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

```


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("ultimatumfairness.png")
```


*Notes:*
Here if earnings are equal, real payoffs are the same as earnings; 0,0 or 5,5 \
Where earnings are unequal, player-1 gets 9 and player-2 gets 1 from material payoffs. \
But because of a difference of 8 in earnings, both players lose 8 in psychological payoffs \
so the net real payoffs if player-1 offered 1 and 2 accepted would be 9-8=1 for player-1 and 1-8=-7 for player-2. \
Using BWI here we see the subgame perfect NE will be that player-1 offers 5 and player-2 accepts.

***

'Envy payoffs'

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("ultimatumenvy.png")
```


*Notes:*
Here we assume because of 'envy', real payoffs equal material payoffs minus the difference in payoffs *for the player with lower payoffs only.* \
For the outcomes considered, only player-2's payoffs are adjusted from the material payoffs; \
she gets 1-8 = -7 from accepting an offer of 1; her payoff is 1 but she loses 7 in envy. \
Because of this she will not accept such an offer. Knowing this, player-1 will offer 5.


## Supplemental (reading): Evidence on the Ultimatum Game


Guth et al. (1982) presented the first experimental test of the ultimatum game.

<br> <br> \bigskip
2 players: Proposer and Responder

<br> <br> \bigskip
Proposer has a pie of size 1. She must propose a split of the pie between the two players $(1-s, s)$


The Responder may:

- accept (in which case the split is executed)
- reject (in which case both players get zero



This is a 'take it or leave it offer' in bargaining. What do you think he/she will offer?  Do you think he/she will accept?  Why or why not?

Now let us try this on veconlab, along with a simple 'Dictator' game

The prize is
***
> This program runs a two-person, bargaining game. In the Dictator version, one person simply decides unilaterally how to split a fixed amount of money. In the Ultimatum treatment, the proposer makes an offer of how to split the money, which the responder either accepts or rejects. An acceptance implements the proposed split, and a rejection results in zero earnings for both.

## Ultimatum game: theoretical predictions

Allowing 'non-credible threats', this game has as many Nash equilibria as there are possible splits of the pie

\

In each of them, the Responder's strategy is to 'accept only if offered X (or more)' for some $X\geq0$, and the Proposer's strategy is to offer exactly X.

\

But maybe these equilibria don't seem like reasonable predictions (why?)

***

Q: What does SPNE predict (use backwards induction)?


- If the split is $(1,0)$, the Responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting

- That still means the Proposer offering $(1,0)$ and the Responder accepting is a NE

The subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is found by solving the game backwards:

- The Proposer (correctly) anticipates the Responder will accept any offer
    - Thus she offers zero, which is accepted 'in equilibrium'

- A 'near zero' offer would lead to a similar result, and might seem more intuitive

`r format_with_col("Note, These are basic game theoretic predictions, not Behavioral.","gray")`


### What happens in experiments? {-}

- Class question: What do you think?

<br> <br> \bigskip

- 50-50 split is the most common offer
- Responders tend to reject offers giving them less than 30\%, even when this is a lot of money


<br> <br> \bigskip


Potential explanations

- Fairness concerns; monetary payoffs may not represent actual payoffs
- Proposers may anticipate this

**EU over outcomes predicts these choices are the same**

Here, in choosing *conditional* choices 'if I win' etc., the decision for each state (win or lose) are separate.

- Max $EU = pr(win)u(win,choice if win) + pr(lose)u(lose,choice if lose)$
- Choice for 'if I win' does *not* affect payoff 'if I lose'

\

- Before: Anticipate what my utility-maximising donation $g^*$ would be if I win the bonus
    - Let $c$ be own consumption, $Y$ income pre-bonus, $w$ the bonus amount, and $g_b$ the committed donation 'if you win $w$'
    - Choose $g_b$ to maximize utility $u(c, g)$ s.t. budget constraint $c+g \leq Y+w$
    - If asked to pre-commit 'if I win', I commit to that choice, so $g_b=g^*$

\

- After: After I have won the bonus $w$, I maximize utility $u(c, g)$ s.t. budget constraint $c+g \leq Y+w$
    - Same maximisation as above, so $g_a=g_b=g^*$


***

**Other models predict distinct outcomes**

- **Reputation:** If I give to benefit my reputation or self-esteem, *unrealised* donations may matter, not just donation outcomes
    - May be an incentive to commit *more* the less likely a donation needs to be paid
    - 'If I win the lottery megabucks, I will give it all away'

- **Loss aversion:** If I am 'loss averse' over my own consumption, it may seem 'cheaper' to commit before I win the bonus than after
    - Why? Because my *reference point* may change.
- Suppose I've £50k income and a potential £50k bonus with 50\% probability
    - Before winning my reference consumption may be the EV, £75k
    - So a conditional donation to donate £10k if I have a total income+bonus of £100k may not seem like a loss
    - But after I win the bonus, my new reference consumption may be £100k
    - So each pound donated might feel like a loss

***

**What do you think happens when you ask people to donate either Before-conditionally or After winning a prize or bonus?**
Do they  commit more 'before' than they give 'after', or vice versa, or are these equivalent?

***

**(25 marks) In this module we discussed \textit{four} major ways in which behavioural economists argue that people diverge from classical assumptions. Briefly explain each of these four ways, citing some evidence (academic or anecdotal) for each.**


There are four general ways people diverge from classical assumptions

**1. Limited cognitive ability $\rightarrow$ difficult and costly to make complex decisions**

It may be very costly and difficult to  do the calculations that we assume are part of standard maximization. Rather than strictly finding the optimal consumption bundles, choosing the optimal number of hours to work per day,  calculating the optimal investment portfolio, etc. people may use heuristics and 'rules of thumb'.


***

\underline{Evidence for Limited Cognitive Ability:} `r format_with_col("This is too long an answer, I'm just giving you some ideas","gray")`

Systematically incorrect answers  to simple financial literacy questions;  and responses correlate with holding an extremely high interest loans.

Many people state they have keep separate fixed budgets for different  categories of expenditure (food, vacations, charity etc).

In marketing/behavioral experiments adding more choices  has sometimes been found to reduce  purchases within a category.

Also, adding an (unchosen) 'largest size' choice  seen to increase consumption of the second largest choice (heuristic: 'choose the middle option')

See also 'taxi driver's heuristic'


<!---
Various experiments:  when people are given coupons and subsidies for one particular good,  for which they typically consume more than that amount of anyways,  this  still disproportionately increases their consumption of that item, rather than being fully fungible.  E.g., there's a paper where a 'drinks voucher' (relative to a 'food voucher')  at a restaurant leads to a greater overall consumption of beverages even for people who normally consume many beverages.
-->

***

\underline{2. Limited willpower $\rightarrow$  self control problems}

People  struggle to make choices that they know are in their best long-term interest. (Evidence: see next part)

\underline{3. Limited self interest $\rightarrow$  care about others (fairness, altruism), issues beyond income/consumption}

\textit{Evidence:}  Significant  charitable giving (1\% of UK GDP),  large part of income spent on family and gifts.  Rejection of positive offers in ultimatum game experiments  (in various lab and naturalistic contexts). Contribution to linear public goods, cooperation in  prisoners dilemmas, even in 1-shot games ...


***

\underline{4. Inconsistent, changing, and 'non-outcome-based' preferences}

\small

People seem to act to maximise targets and avoid losses relative to reference points.  For example several papers report evidence consistent with people (e.g., taxi drivers) setting 'earnings targets' and thus working \textit{fewer hours} on days when their per-hour earnings are higher (and they should know this).    It can be shown that if drivers were to  work fewer hours on 'bad'  and more hours on 'good'  days they could more money working the same number of hours,  and even have less variance in a number of hours they work. This cannot be reconciled with a model maximising an unchanging utility function.



***

**(25 marks)  For \textit{TWO} of the major departures above, give a \textit{specific example} of such behaviour, and briefly describe the nature of the evidence for this, and present one behavioural economics model explaining this behaviour.**

**First departure I am discussing: 'Inconsistent, changing, and 'non-outcome-based' preferences'**


<br> <br> \bigskip

**'Specific example of behaviour'**


The Allais paradox offers evidence against Expected Utility maximisation (over outcomes) and in line with Loss Aversion and Prospect Theory.


***

 Scenario such as

- Gamble A: 89\% chance win £ 1 mln, 10\% chance win £ 5 mln, \& 1\% chance win 0.

- Gamble B: £1 million with certainty.

\textit{vs.}

- Gamble C: 89\% chance of winning 0 and an 11\% chance of winning £1 million

- Gamble D: a 90\% chance of win 0  and 10\% chance of winning £5 million.

Consistently in hypothetical and incentivised experiments people tend to choose B over A and also choose D over C.

***

\textit{This contradicts Expected Utility theory}:

If $B \succ A$ then $EU(A) > EU(B)$

$\rightarrow U(1m) > 0.89 \: U(1m) + 0.1 \: U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0)$

$\rightarrow$ $0.11 \: U(1m) >  0.1 U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0)$

\medskip


<br> <br> \bigskip


However,  if $D \succ C$ then $EU(D)>EU(C)$

$\rightarrow 0.9 \: U(0) + 0.1 U(5m) > 0.89 \: U(0) + 0.11 \: U(1m)$

Implying $0.1 \: U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0) > 0.11 \: U(1m)$

Contradicting the above!

***
\small

**'Describe the nature of evidence for this'**

\underline{Evidence:}  In hypothetical experiments by Kahneman and Tversky, as well in experiments with real incentives (e.g., Huck and Muller),  people tend to choose B over A, and also to choose D over C. (Sometimes the same people  will make  of these apparently inconsistent choices but in general  the differences in proportions are large enough that we can show the general pattern even if we're only asking people to make a single choice.)

***

**'...and present one behavioural economics model'**

\textit{Why do many people choose B over A and D over C?}

<br> <br> \bigskip

\underline{One theory: Loss aversion/Prospect theory}

\footnotesize

Theory: People evaluate outcomes relative to \textit{reference points}. Falling below these reference points is particular costly to utility; the usual specification models utility as the  some of a  standard risk-averse utility function and a ' gain-loss' utility function. The latter is negative where some outcome (e.g., earnings) falls below a reference point; it's slope is assumed to be greatest for 'small losses' and then more gradual for larger losses. In net this can make people risk seekers over a range of losses, willing to increase the risk of a large loss to reduce the risk of a small loss. The reference points themselves may change depending on the framing of the decision, on previous expectation, on unrealised states, and in general on things that are not relevant to future material outcomes of the decision.


***

<br> <br> \bigskip

\textit{Applying this to the example above ... (Allais Paradox)}

- Considering A \& B, the ref. point may be close to £1000, as this can be had with certainty.

    -  A seems to 'risk a costly loss of £1000', thus may choose 'safer' $B>A$, notwithstanding its far lower EV (£1000 vs £1390)


<br> <br> \bigskip

- Considering D \& C, ref. point may be close to 0, as EV's of each are low, \& 0 is likeliest outcome

    - So 'don't worry about losses', choose D over C because  higher EV (£500 vs. £110)

`r format_with_col("This could also be shown with a diagram of EU in income, and a  shifting reference point; see notes and text","gray")`


***

*By the way, here are some more behavioural econ problems to practice ... from Nicholson and Snyder chapter 17 (12th ed, 11th similar)*

- 17.2: this will be especially helpful for understanding the EU basis of the Allais Paradox
- 17.3
- (17.5)
- 17.7: pretty good setup for time inconsistent behaviour
- (17.8) - also a good setup for time inconsistency, has video solution on CourseMate
- 17.9 - decent for understanding loss aversion. Should say 'would his choice change *if* his reference point' ('if' is missing)
