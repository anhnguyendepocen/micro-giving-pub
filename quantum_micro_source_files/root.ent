{1introa}You
should
not
believe
this
argument
because
the
amount
spent
on
the
rights
to
the
Olympic
Games
is
a
sunk
cost.
The
reason
the
network
showed
the
Olympics
for
so
many
hours
was
because
that
was
the
decision
that
maximized

\par
\begin
{CALCULUS}
We
can
also
see
this
mathematically:
the
amount
spent
on
the
rights
to
the
Games
is
a
constant
term
in
the
profit
function,
e.g.,
$\pi
=
f(h)
-
c$
where
$f(h)$
are
advertising
revenues
from
showing
the
games
for
$h$
hours
and
$c$
is
the
amount
spent
on
the
rights
to
the
games.
To
maximize
this,
we
take
a
derivative
with
respect
to
$h$
and
set
it
equal
to
zero.
Note
that
the
constant
term
$c$
drops
out
when
we
take
a
derivative,
and
therefore
has
no
impact
on
the
optimal
choice
of
$h$.

the
yearly
option,
we
need
to
split
the
payment
into
three
parts:
the
\$500,000
you
get
immediately
(which
has
a
present
value
of
\$500,000),
the
28-year
annuity
(which,
using
the
annuity
formula,
has
a
present
value
of
about
\$3.35
million),
and
the
payment
in
year
29
(which,
using
the
present
value
of
a
lump
sum
formula,
has
a
present
value
of
about
\$460,400).
We
add
these
up
to
get
a
present
value
of
about
\$4.31
million.
\par
To
calculate
the
present
value
of
the
weekly
option,
we
first
need
to
calculate
a
weekly
interest
rate
that
is
in
accordance
with
a
yearly
interest
rate
of
6\%.
A
decent
approximation
is
to
divide
the
yearly
interest
rate
by
the
number
of
weeks
in
a
year
(52),
yielding
a
weekly
interest
rate
of
about
0.115\%,
i.e.,
$s\approx
0.00115$.
(If
you
don't
like
approximations,
here's
how
to
use
logarithms
to
get
the
true
value.
If
you
put
$x$
in
the
bank
at
a
weekly
interest
rate
of
$100\cdot
s\%$,
after
one
year
(52
weeks),
you'll
have
$x(1+s)^{52}$
in
the
bank.
We
want
this
to
equal
$x(1.06)$,
since
this
follows
from
a
yearly
interest
rate
of
6\%.
Setting
$x(1+s)^{52}=x(1.06)$
and
solving
for
$s$
using
logarithms
gives
us
$s\approx
.00112$,
i.e.,
an
interest
rate
of
about
0.112\%.)
Using
this
value
of
$s$
in
the
annuity\index
{annuity}
formula
along
with
\$5,000
and
2,000
weeks
gives
us
a
present
value
of
about
\$3.91
million
for
the
weekly
option.
\par
Finally,
the
present
value
of
receiving
\$3.5
million
immediately
is
\$3.5
million.
So
the
best
option
is
the
yearly
payments.

here
is
that
the
rate

So
even

\par
One
way
to
see
the

is
to
imagine
that
you'd
invested
100
U.S.
dollars
in
a

bank
in
June
2000.
The
exchange
rate
then
was
about
610,000
Turkish
lira
to
\$1,
so
your
\$100
would
have
gotten
you
61
million
Turkish
lira.
After
one
year
at
a
59\%
interest
rate,
you
would
have
97
million
lira.
But
when
you
try
to
change
that
back
into
U.S.
dollars,
you
find
that
the
exchange
rate
has
changed:
in
June
2001
it's
1,240,000
lira
to
\$1,
so
your
97
million

buys
only
\$78.23.

As
long
as
the
interest
rate
is
sufficiently
low,
the
players
can
also
cooperate
by
taking
turns:
(C,
D),
(D,
C),
(C,
D),\ldots
\
Instead
of
gaining
\$1
every
stage
(which
is
the
result
with
the
trigger
strategies),
each
player
now
gains
\$5
every
two
stages.
As
an
exercise,
you
can
formally
define
this
strategy
(what
happens
if
the
other
player
doesn't
cooperate?)
and
determine
the
interest
rates
that
allow
this
strategy
as
a
Nash
equilibrium
and
those
that
make
this
strategy
a
Pareto
improvement
over
the
trigger
strategy.
There
are
also
plenty
of
other
strategies,
e.g.,
tit-for-tat,
that
you
can
play
around
with
if
you
wish.

&
=
&

+

Now,
we

to
find
$p$
and
$q$
that
form
a
Nash
equilibrium,
i.e.,
that
are
mutual
best
responses.
To
do
this,
we
take
derivatives
and
set
them
equal
to
zero.
\par
So:
player
1
wants
to
choose
$p$
to
maximize
$E(\pi
_1)=pq
+3(1-p)(1-q).$
Any
value
of
$p$
that
maximizes
this
is
either
a
corner
solution\index
{corner
solution}
(i.e.,
one
of
the
pure
strategies
$p=1$
or
$p=0$)
or
an
interior
solution\index
{interior

with
$0<p<1$,
in
which
case
the
partial
derivative
of
$E(\pi
_1)$
with
respect
to
$p$
must
be
zero:
\[
\frac
{\partial
E(\pi
_1)}{\partial
p}=0\Longrightarrow
q-3(1-q)=0\Longrightarrow
4q=3\Longrightarrow
q=\frac
{3}{4}.
\]
This
tells
us
that
\emph
{any}
interior
value
of
$p$
is
a
candidate
maximum
as
long
as
$q=\frac
{3}{4}$.
Mathematically,
this
makes
sense
because
if
$q=\frac
{3}{4}$
then
player
1's
expected
payoff
(no
matter
what
his
choice
of
$p$)
is
always
\[
E(\pi
_1)=pq
+3(1-p)(1-q)=\frac
{3}{4}p+3\frac
{1}{4}(1-p)=\frac
{3}{4}.
\]
If
player
2
chooses
$q\neq
\frac
{3}{4}$
then
player
1's
best
response
is
to
choose
$p=1$
(if
$q>\frac
{3}{4}$)
or
$p=0$
(if
$q<\frac
{3}{4}$).
\par
We
can
now
do
the
math
for
player
2
and
come
up
with
a
similar
conclusion.
Player
2's
expected
payoff
is
$pi_2=3pq+(1-q)(1-p)$.
Any
value
of
$q$
that
maximizes
this
is
either
a
corner
solution\index
{corner
solution}
(i.e.,
one
of
the
pure
strategies
$q=1$
or
$q=0$)
or
an
interior
solution
with
$0<q<1$,
in
which
case
\[
\frac
{\partial
E(\pi
_2)}{\partial
q}=0\Longrightarrow
3p-(1-p)=0\Longrightarrow
4p=1\Longrightarrow
p=\frac
{1}{4}.
\]
So
if
player
1
chooses
$p=\frac
{1}{4}$
then
any
choice
of
$q$
is
a
best
response
for
player
2.
But
if
player
1
chooses
$p\neq
\frac
{1}{4}$
then
player
2's
best
response
is
a
pure
strategy:
if
player
1
chooses
$p>\frac
{1}{4}$
then
player
2's
best
response
is
to
choose
$q=1$;
if
player
1
chooses
$p<\frac
{1}{4}$
then
player
2's
best
response
is
to
choose
$q=0$.
\par
Now
we
can
put
our
results
together
to
find
the
Nash
equilibria
in
this
game.
If
player

$p$

(in

And

either

(in

\par
Three
choices
for
player
1
and

nine
candidate
Nash

\begin
{description}
\item
[Four

$(p=1,q=1),
(p=1,

(p=0,

\item
[One

$(0<p<1,

\item
[Four

$(p=1,
0<q<1),
(p=0,
0<q<1),
(0<p<1,q=1),
(0<p<1,
q=0)$.
\end
{description}
We
can
see
from
the
payoff
matrix
that
there
are
two
Nash
equilibria
among
the
four
pure
strategy
candidates:
$(p=1,q=1)$
and
$(p=0,q=0)$.
The
other
other
two
are
not
Nash
equilibra.
We
can
also
see
that
the
four
pure/mixed
combinations
are
not
best
responses;
for
example,
$(p=1,0<q<1)$
is
not
a
Nash
equilibrium
because
if
player
1
chooses
$p=1$
then
player
2's
best
response
is
to
choose
$q=1$,
not
$0<q<1$.
\par
But
the
mixed
strategy
candidate
does
yield
a
Nash
equilibrium:
player
1's
choice
of
$0<p<1$
is
a
best
response
as
long
as
$q=\frac
{3}{4}$.
And
player
2's
choice
of
$0<q<1$
is
a
best
response
as
long
as
$p=\frac
{1}{4}$.
So
the
player's
strategies
are
mutual
best
responses
if
$(p=\frac
{1}{4},
q=\frac
{3}{4}$).
\par
So
this
game
has
three
Nash
equilibria:
two
in
pure
strategies
and
one
in
mixed
strategies.
\@endanenote

+
(1-p)[q(-2)+(1-q)(1)]\\
&

&
p(q-1)
+(1-p)(1-3q).
\end
{eqnarray*}
Similarly,
player

chooses
$q$
to

\begin
{eqnarray*}
E(\pi

&
=
&
q[p(0)+(1-p)(1)]
+

&

&
q(1-p)+(1-q)(7p-2).
\end
{eqnarray*}
Now,
we
want
to
find
$p$
and
$q$
that
form
a
Nash
equilibrium,
i.e.,
that
are
mutual
best
responses.
To
do
this,
we
take
derivatives
and
set
them
equal
to
zero.
\par
So:
player
1
wants
to
choose
$p$
to
maximize
$E(\pi
_1)=p(q-1)
+(1-p)(1-3q).$
Any
value
of
$p$
that
maximizes
this
is
either
a
corner
solution\index
{corner
solution}
(i.e.,
one
of
the
pure
strategies
$p=1$
or
$p=0$)
or
an
interior
solution\index
{interior

with
$0<p<1$,
in
which
case
the
partial
derivative
of
$E(\pi
_1)$
with
respect
to
$p$
must
be
zero:
\[
\frac
{\partial
E(\pi
_1)}{\partial
p}=0\Longrightarrow
q-1-(1-3q)=0\Longrightarrow
4q=2\Longrightarrow
q=\frac
{1}{2}.
\]
This
tells
us
that
\emph
{any}
interior
value
of
$p$
is
a
candidate
maximum
as
long
as
$q=\frac
{1}{2}$.
Mathematically,
this
makes
sense
because
if
$q=\frac
{1}{2}$
then
player
1's
expected
payoff
(no
matter
what
his
choice
of
$p$)
is
always
\[
E(\pi
_1)=p(q-1)
+(1-p)(1-3q)=-\frac
{1}{2}p+(1-p)\frac
{-1}{2}=-\frac
{1}{2}.
\]
If
player
2
chooses
$q\neq
\frac
{1}{2}$
then
player
1's
best
response
is
to
choose
$p=1$
(if
$q>\frac
{1}{2}$)
or
$p=0$
(if
$q<\frac
{1}{2}$).
\par
We
can
now
do
the
math
for
player
2
and
come
up
with
a
similar
conclusion.
Player
2's
expected
payoff
is
$q(1-p)+(1-q)(7p-2)$.
Any
value
of
$q$
that
maximizes
this
is
either
a
corner
solution\index
{corner
solution}
(i.e.,
one
of
the
pure
strategies
$q=1$

$q=0$)
or
an
interior
solution
with
$0<q<1$,
in
which
case
\[
\frac
{\partial
E(\pi
_2)}{\partial
q}=0\Longrightarrow
1-p-(7p-2)=0\Longrightarrow
8p=3\Longrightarrow
p=\frac
{3}{8}.
\]
So
if
player
1
chooses
$p=\frac
{3}{8}$
then
any
choice
of
$q$
is
a
best

for
player
2.
But
if
player
1
chooses
$p\neq
\frac
{3}{8}$
then
player
2's
best
response
is
a

if
player

chooses
$p>\frac
{3}{8}$
then
player
2's
best

is
to
choose
$q=0$;
if
player
1
chooses
$p<\frac

then
player
2's
best

is
to
choose
$q=1$.

Now

We
can

from
the

that
there

no
Nash

pure

We
can

are
not

for
example,
$(p=1,0<q<1)$
is

because
if

chooses

is
to
choose
$q=0$,

\par
But
the
mixed

candidate
does
yield
a
Nash
equilibrium:
player
1's
choice

$0<p<1$

as

choice
of
$0<q<1$
is
a
best
response
as
long
as
$p=\frac

So
the
player's
strategies
are
mutual
best
responses
if
$(p=\frac

in
a

not
in
a
second-price

So
in

you

(In

there
is
a
deeper
result
in
game
theory,
called
the
Revenue
Equivalence
Theorem,
which
predicts
that
both
types
of

will
yield
the

the

you

you
increase
the

(Optimal

in
this
case
are
complicated.
How
much
to
shade
your

with

the

a

equivalent
to

This
is
because
the

price
is
the

the

when
the

the

(\$1.20

the

half

Substituting

\[
\pi

(pq_1-C(q_1)\right
)=2\left
(8(1)-3(1^2)\right
)=2(5)=10.
\]
\par
\par
Next,
the
Cournot
problem.
Here
Firm
1
chooses
$q_1$
to
maximize
its
profits
and
Firm
2
chooses
$q_2$
to
maximize
its
profits.
(The
profit
functions
are
given
above.)
To
solve
this
problem
we
take
a
partial
derivative
of
$\pi
_1$
with
respect
to
$q_1$
to
get
a
necessary
first-order
condition\index
{necessary
first-order
condition}
(NFOC)
for
Firm
1.
We
then
take
a
partial
derivative
of
$\pi
_2$
with
respect
to
$q_2$
to
get
a
necessary
first-order
condition\index
{necessary
first-order
condition}
(NFOC)
for
Firm
2.
Solving
these
NFOCs
simultaneously
gives
us
the
Cournot
outcome.
\par
So:
the
NFOCs
are
\[
\frac
{\partial
(\pi
_1)}{\partial
q_1}=0\Longrightarrow
10-q_2-8q_1=0
\]
and
\[
\frac
{\partial
(\pi
_2)}{\partial
q_2}=0\Longrightarrow
(10-q_1)
-8q_2=0
\]
Solving
these
jointly
yields
$q_1=q_2=\frac
{10}{9}$.
The
price
is
therefore
$p=10-\frac
{20}{9}=\frac
{70}{9}$.
\par
\par
Finally,
the
Stackleberg
problem.
The
objective
functions
look
the
same
as
in
the
Cournot
case,
but
here
we
use
backward
induction
to
solve.
Firm
2
sees
what
Firm
1
has
chosen,
and
so
chooses
$q_2$
to
maximize
its
profits.
It
does
this
by
taking
a
partial
derivative
of
$\pi
_2$
(given
above)
with
respect
to
$q_2$
to
get
an
NFOC
that
is
Firm
2's
best
response
function
to
Firm
1's
choice
of
$q_1$.
Next,
Firm
1
must
anticipate
Firm
2's
reaction
to
its
choice
of
$q_1$,
and
substitute
this
reaction
function
$q_2(q_1)$
into
its
profit
function.
Taking
a
partial
derivative
of
the
resulting
profit
function
$\pi
_1$
with
respect
to
$q_1$
yields
an
NFOC
that
identifies
Firm
1's
profit-maximizing
choice
of
$q_1$.
Plugging
this
solution
into
Firm
2's
best
response
function
identifies
Firm
2's
profit-maximizing
response
of
$q_2$.
\par
So:
The
NFOC
for
Firm
2
is
exactly
as
above:
$10-q_1-8q_2=0$,
i.e.,
$q_2=\frac
{10-q_1}{8}$.
Substituting
this
into
Firm
1's
profit
function
yields
\[
\pi
_1=(10-q_2)q_1-4q_1^2=\left
(10-\frac
{10-q_1}{8}\right
)q_1-4q_1^2=\frac
{1}{8}(70q_1-31q_1^2).
\]
Taking
a
derivative
with
respect
to
$q_1$
gives
us
the
NFOC
\[
\frac
{\partial
\pi
_1}{\partial
q_1}=0\Longrightarrow
\frac
{1}{8}(70-62q_1)=0\Longrightarrow
q_1=\frac
{35}{31}\approx
1.13.
\]
Plugging
this
into
Firm
2's
best
response
function
yields
\[
q_2=\frac
{10-q_1}{8}\approx
\frac
{10-1.13}{8}\approx
1.11.

To

we

us
our

\par
So:
the

are

\frac
{\partial

Solving
these

yields
$q_1=\frac
{15}{19}\approx
.79$
and
$q_2=\frac
{4}{3}q_1\approx
1.05$.
The
price
is
therefore
$p\approx
10-.79-1.05=8.16$

are
\begin

Next,

Solving

The

$10-q_1-10q_2=0$,
i.e.,
$q_2=\frac
{10-q_1}{10}$.
Substituting
this
into
Firm
1's
profit
function
yields
\[
\pi
_1=(10-q_2)q_1-5q_1^2=\left
(10-\frac
{10-q_1}{10}\right
)q_1-5q_1^2=\frac
{1}{10}(90q_1-49q_1^2).
\]
Taking
a
derivative
with
respect
to
$q_1$
gives
us
the
NFOC
\[
\frac
{\partial
\pi
_1}{\partial
q_1}=0\Longrightarrow
\frac
{1}{10}(90-98q_1)=0\Longrightarrow
q_1=\frac
{90}{98}\approx
.92.
\]
Plugging
this
into
Firm
2's
best
response
function
yields
\[
q_2=\frac
{10-q_1}{10}\approx
\frac
{10-.92}{10}\approx
.91.
