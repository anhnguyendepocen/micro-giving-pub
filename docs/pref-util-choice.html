<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Preferences, Utility and Choice</h1>
<p>What can we reasonably say about ‘what people prefer and choose’? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular ‘reasonable’ assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of ‘optimization’? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions?</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Digging deeply into the logic and justifications for these models of choice, and alternative frameworks, will be very relevant in considering Behavioral Economics (This is a specialty of Ariel Rubinstein, one of the O-R text’s two authors, and also a research interest of mine). In fact this text works behavioral economics in from the beginning.</p>
<p>This is also relevant for building empirical models such as ‘models of consumer choices and preferences’ in ways that are relevant to (e.g.) Business-data-analytics consulting.</p>
</div>
<!-- This will take at least two weeks to cover meaningfully. -->

<div class="note">
<p>We approach this in an abstract and logically and mathematically-rigorous, but not highly ‘computational’ way. Even if you have taken Economics as an undergraduate, you may not have seen this approach.</p>
We will not always be quite so mathematically rigorous throughout the module. However, I want to at least give you some of these tools, and a ‘flavour’ of this approach, which characterises modern Microeconomics (and will be at the core of PhD modules).

<div class="inputq">
<p>Next, suppose I asked you: ‘State a rule that governs how people <em>do</em> make decisions’…</p>
<p>I want this rule to be both</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Informative (it rules <em>out</em> at least some sets of choices) and</p></li>
<li><p>Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now suppose I asked an apparently similar question:</p>

<div class="inputq">
<p>‘State a rule that governs how people <em>should</em> make decisions’..</p>
<p>By ‘should’ I mean that <em>they will not regret having made decisions in this way.</em></p>
<p>If people <em>did</em> follow these rules, what would this imply and predict?</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Economists (and decision theorists/decision scientists) have specifically defined such rules in terms of ‘axioms about preferences’</p>
<p>They have started from these ‘reasonable axioms’ and followed their logical implications for individual choices, individual responses to changes in prices and income, market prices and quantities and their responses, ‘welfare’ and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc.</p>
<p>The ‘Standard axioms’ (imply that) choices can be expressed by ‘individuals maximising <em>utility functions</em> subject to their <em>budget constraints</em>’.</p>
<p>This yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc. We will get to this.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>We want to develop a model that can be used to show how we make choices or decisions.</p>
<p>In the (neo) classical economics framework, your (optimising) choices are determined by two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Preferences: what goods do you like?</p></li>
<li><p>Constraints: how much money do you have, what are the prices of the goods you buy?</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font color='green'>Some more thoughts on ‘why are we learning this strange stuff?’ (unfold)</font></p>

<div class="fold">
<p>For the classical Economics model, the work on preferences seems (to me) mainly as largely a matter of ‘finding a consistent justification for our models of utility and choice’. If you already find these models plausible, perhaps this is not so interesting.</p>
<p>However, I see these details as particular relevant for a few reasons and in a few contexts.</p>
<p><strong>When we take a step back and look outside the classical model to consider:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Group and ‘social preferences’</strong> including preferences over abstract quantities and contexts that nonetheless have real impact on decisions. For example, ‘effective altruists’ and social planners need to consider whether to support charities and policies that may ‘bring more happy people into existence’ against others that do more to ‘improve the happiness of existing people’. The philosophical issue of “population ethics” (see., e.g., <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="blackorbyIntertemporalPopulationEthics1995"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, and the discussion in <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/hilary-greaves-global-priorities-institute/#transcript">this podcast</a>) delves deeply into how preferences can be reasonably defined. … and millions of dollars in donations are potentially at stake.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>2. ‘Behavioral economics’</strong> models that consider choices (and perhaps preferences) that are inconsistent in certain ways, and potential affected by ‘frames’.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>3. Empirical approaches to modeling choices</strong>, including some models such as ‘tree-models’, which may not be easily connected to the standard ‘utility-maximizing’ approach.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Also, this formality sharpens your mind</strong>, and makes you better at logical argumentation in your research work, and perhaps also in things like computer programming</p>

<div id="preferences-notation-definition-explanation" class="section level3" number="2.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Preferences: Notation, definition, explanation</h3>
<p>O-R give some background</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We follow the approach almost all economic theory and characterize an individual by her preferences among the alternatives, without considering the origin of these preferences.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>And unlike many other texts, O-R <em>explain</em> that they are doing this, and, in the examples, give some indication of <em>why</em> this is relevant.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What sort of ‘preferences’ are we considering? Just ‘ordinal’ ones, at least for now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we express preferences, we make statements like “I prefer a to b”, “I like a much better than b”, …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this book [as is standard] the model of preferences captures only statements of the first type… [the <em>ranking</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can think of an individual’s preferences over a set of alternatives as encoding the answers to a questionnaire. For every pair <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> of alternatives in the set, the questionnaire asks the individual which of the following three statements fits best his attitude to the alternatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I prefer x to y.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I prefer y to x.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I regard x and y as equally desirable.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>These will later be formally encoded as</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x \succ y\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(y \succ x\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(x \prec y\)</span>),</p></li>
</ol>
<p>and</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(x \sim y\)</span>, or equivalently, <span class="math inline">\(y \sim x\)</span> (formally: because ‘equivalence operators are reflexive’),</li>
</ol>
<p>… respectively. However, as O-R show, these can all in fact be denoted with the careful use of a single ‘at least as good’ operator.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>O-R next discuss ‘binary relations’ and their properties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A binary relation on a set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> specifies, for each ordered pair <span class="math inline">\((x , y )\)</span> of members of X , whether or not x relates to y in a certain way.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />

<div class="tip">
<p>This is getting abstract, and unless you’ve taken some ‘pure maths’ you may be a bit confused and overwhelmed here. In this case, I will try to help you: the folded content below is a question and answer on this with a student. Beware that this is a digression, so if you already know this stuff, you can skip it.</p>
</div>

<div class="fold">
<p><strong>Q (from student whom I will call ‘Sue’): Not sure the meaning of ‘binary relation’. Does it refer to relationships between two objects?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Yes, this is a pure maths concept.</strong>8 Think of a ‘binary relation’ as a computer program that does the following…</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You enter two objects (say ‘peanut butter’ and ‘jelly’)</li>
<li>It tells you ‘yes, these objects are related’ or ‘no, they are not related’.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, we can apply the binary relationship ‘<span class="math inline">\(R_s\)</span>: objects go well together in a sandwich’ to the above…</p>
<p>‘Peanut butter’ <span class="math inline">\(R_s\)</span> ‘Jelly’ <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <code>true</code></p>
<p>‘Peanut butter’ <span class="math inline">\(R_s\)</span> ‘tuna fish’ <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <code>false</code></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another binary relation could be ‘<span class="math inline">\(R_l\)</span>: ’the first object is usually larger than the second one.’ Here we would have:</p>
<p>‘Whale’ <span class="math inline">\(R_s\)</span> ‘Minnow’ <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <code>true</code></p>
<p>‘Minnow’ <span class="math inline">\(R_s\)</span> ‘Whale’ <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <code>false</code></p>
<p><em>Sue: Thank you! These examples are great!! I think they would be great to put in the web-book if you are planning to create one.</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, “acquaintance” is a binary relation on a set of people. For some pairs <span class="math inline">\((x , y )\)</span> of people, the statement “x is acquainted with y” is true, and for some pairs it is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The English word ‘acquaintance’ basically means ‘has met’ or ‘knows’).</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Continuing with these questions and answers … (unfold)</p>

<div class="fold">
<p><strong>Q: What does the ‘acquaintance’ example mean?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: To give more specific examples,</strong> we could have, for <span class="math inline">\(R_a\)</span>: ‘is aquainted with’:</p>
<p>Sue <span class="math inline">\(R_a\)</span> “Sue’s lecturer in the UK” <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <code>true</code></p>
<p>Sue <span class="math inline">\(R_a\)</span> “Sue’s mother” <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <code>true</code></p>
<p>“Sue’s mother” <span class="math inline">\(R_a\)</span> “Sue” <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <code>true</code> (note it is ‘reflexive’)</p>
<p>“Sue’s mother” <span class="math inline">\(R_a\)</span> “Sue’s lecturer in the UK” <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <code>false</code> (so it’s not ‘transitive’)</p>
<p><em>Sue: I was not sure what ’aquaintance meant in this example. Now I do understand!</em></p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another example of a binary relation (unfold Q&amp;A)…</p>

<div class="fold">
<blockquote>
<p>Another example of a binary relation is “smaller than” on the set of numbers. For some pairs <span class="math inline">\((x,y )\)</span> of numbers, x is smaller than y , and for some it is not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For a binary relation R, the expression <span class="math inline">\(x R y\)</span> means that x is related to y according to R. For any pair <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> of members of X , the statement <span class="math inline">\(x R y\)</span> either holds or does not hold. For example, for the binary relation &lt; on the set of numbers, we have <span class="math inline">\(3 &lt; 5\)</span>, but not <span class="math inline">\(7&lt;1\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Q: Given that R stands for relation, what does <span class="math inline">\(xRy\)</span> means? Does it mean the relationship between x and y?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: It means ‘x relates to y, by the relation R’.</strong> If the relation R is ‘greater than’, then <span class="math inline">\(xRy\)</span> means ’x is greater than y$.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Q: If so, what does yRx mean?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: It means ‘y relates to x’ …. with the above example it means ‘y is greater than x’.</strong></p>
<p>Sue: Aha!! I see.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>O-R begin with the formal definition of ‘at least as desirable as’ (or ‘seen as at least as good as’). In other words,</p>
<p>“x is at least as desirable as y” is denoted <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>if the individual’s answer to the question regarding x and y is either “I prefer x to y” or “I regard x and y as equally desirable”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O-R show, that in fact, <em>all</em> of the preference relationships can be denoted with the careful use of the <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span> operator. For example:</p>
<p>‘Indifference’:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x \sim y \text{ if both } x \succsim y \text{ and } y \succsim x\]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p>‘Strict preference’</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x \succ y \text{ if } x \succsim y \text{ but not } y \succsim x\]</span>.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Why? In pure maths, and perhaps in economic theory, they value stating a concept with the fewest and most ‘primal’ definitions possible.</p>
<p>Technical note: This can help in proving properties of these objects and systems. By characterising something as the simplest mathematical object possible, we can apply all of the properties of that mathematical object that have been proven over the centuries.</p>
</div>

<div class="inputq">
<p>Exercise: to be sure you understand these things, close your book/computer and try to reconstruct the construction of strict preferences or indifference from only the <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span> operator. Can you give the intuition for this, explaining it clearly?</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>In the case above it seems strange to not be able to express a preference. But for other cases it may be extremely difficult or painful to compare two things.

<p>A binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> on the set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is complete if for all members <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, either <span class="math inline">\(x R y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y R x\)</span> (or both).</p>

<p>A complete binary relation is, in particular, <em>reflexive</em>: for every <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(x R x\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In case you are confused, please unfold the Q &amp;A below…</p>

<div class="fold">
<p><strong>Q: I am still confused with the concept of ‘reflexivity’ after reading these paragraphs. Does it mean all ‘x’ are the same</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>A: Not exactly,</strong> reflexivity is a property (a characteristic) of the <em>relation</em> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> (where this ‘relation’ could be ‘greater than’, ‘smaller than’, ‘equal’, ‘having the same number of elements’, ‘preferred to’, etc.), not the property of a ‘mathematial object’ itself.</p>
<p>Reflexivity holds where an object always “relates to itself”. For example, in standard maths the relationship ’greater than or equal to (<span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span>) is reflexive, while the relationship <span class="math inline">\(\gt\)</span> is <em>not</em> reflexive. For any number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> the statement <span class="math inline">\(x \geq x\)</span> is true (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(10 \geq 10\)</span> is true because <span class="math inline">\(10=10\)</span>). However, the statement <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;x\)</span> is false … obviously a number cannot be greater than itself! (Only the Red Queen can exceed her own greatness.)</p>
<p>Sue: Hmmmm, why is <span class="math inline">\(10 \geq 10\)</span> true??? How could 10 possibly be greater than 10? Shouldn’t the only correct statement be 10 = 10?</p>
<p>DR: Because this is the ‘greater than <em>or</em> equal to’ sign. Of course ‘10 is greater than or equal to 10’ because they are equal. Just as in computer programming, with an ‘OR’ operator the condition evaluates as true if either (or both) of the conditions are true.</p>
<p>Sue: Ooook, I think I understand it now. It makes sense to me when you linked it with computer programming; <strong>but what is the point of the <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span> sign? Couldn’t the authors only use the <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> sign?</strong></p>
<p>DR: This is in fact a notation from set theory. We are expressing preferences over objects which may not be representable by a single number.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sue: … <strong>But then why ‘completeness’ automatically ensures the second property ‘reflexivity’? </strong></p>
<p>DR: The authors are saying that the first property of the binary relationship, ‘completeness’ automatically ensures the second property ‘reflexivity’. Equivalently (contrapositive statement) “a relationship that is not reflexive can not be complete.”</p>
<p>But they have only <em>stated</em> that this is the case. <strong>They have not PROVEN it.</strong> We would have to look up a proof or try to construct it ourselves. They don’t give the proof of this in the main text.</p>

<h4>Transitivity</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>For a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(\succ\)</span> to correspond to a preference relation, we require not only that it be complete, but also that it be consistent in the sense that if <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \succsim z\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim z\)</span>. This property is called transitivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intuitively: Transitive preferences are ‘internally consistent’: If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Formally definition of ‘transitive binary relation’ (optional)</p>

<div class="def">
<p><strong>Definition: Transitive binary relation</strong> [O-R]</p>
<p>A binary relation R on the set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is transitive if for any members <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> , $$ , and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(x R y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y R z\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(x R z\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let’s explore this more simply in terms of <em>strict</em> preferences, the <span class="math inline">\(\succ\)</span> symbol.</p>
<p>Transitivity means:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ A \succ B \: and \: B \succ C \rightarrow A \succ C \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer an Apple to a Cherry.</p></li>
<li><p>A similar idea holds if I am indifferent between one pair of these. (<span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>… this obviously extends to ‘chains’ combining these … so</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[ A \succ B \:\: and \: \: B \sim C \rightarrow A \succ C \]</span>
etc.</p>
<p>We may write this concisely as <span class="math inline">\(A \succ B \sim C\)</span>.</p>

<div class="tip">
<p>If this seems confusing it may be because it is <em>too</em> obvious (although behavioral and experimental economists claim to find violations of this.</p>
</div>
<p><em>If you found someone who striclty preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them!.</em></p>

<div class="compq">
<p>Consider: How would you do this? (Unfold below for a description).</p>
</div>

<div class="fold">
<p>It works as follows (being a bit informal here):</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of banana (or ‘money’).</p></li>
<li><p>Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra.</p></li>
<li><p>Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra.</p></li>

<p>… Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you’ve drained them of all of their resources.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5</span> Possible preferences .. “Preference formation”</h3>
<p>We might derive preference relations from a few “basic considerations”, perhaps reflecting how people describe their own preferences (and choices) in conversation.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>These can be considered in terms of individual preferences, or, as we will see later, ways to express group-preferences or social preferences.</p>
</div>
<p>We will consider a few examples, some of which <em>do</em> satisfy completeness and transitivity, and some of which do not satisfy one or both of these.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div id="value_function" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Value functions</h4>
<p>O-R first consider ‘value function’ “<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> that attaches to each alternative a number” … the preference relation here "is defined by $x y if and only if <span class="math inline">\(v(x) \succsim v(y)\)</span>.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>This is close to the ‘utility function’ that we will discuss later. It is trivial to show that this is complete and transitive. (Can you show it?).</p>
</div>

<div class="warning">
<em>Do you know what ‘if and only if’ means?</em> This is important. (If you don’t know, unfold below.)
</div>

<div class="fold">
<p>“If and only if” is sometimes depicted as <span class="math inline">\(\leftrightarrow\)</span> (and abbreviated ‘<em>iff</em>’).</p>
<p>When we say “statement A holds <em>if and only</em> statement B holds”, we mean that whenever statement B holds statement A must hold, and also, whenever statement A holds statement B must hold. This also implies that if statement A <em>does not</em> hold, statement B <em>cannot hold</em> and vice versa.</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is “statement A is a necessary and sufficient condition for statement B.”</p>
<p>For example, in simple algebra we can assert (and prove):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(x &gt; y\)</span> <em>if and only if</em> <span class="math inline">\(2x &gt; 2y\)</span>, i.e.,
<span class="math inline">\(x &gt; y \leftrightarrow 2x &gt; 2y\)</span>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To prove the ‘if and only if’ relationship, you need to prove <em>both directions</em> of this relationship. For this example, I would need to show both:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(x &gt; y \rightarrow 2x &gt; 2y\)</span> <em>and</em></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(2x &gt; 2y \rightarrow x &gt; y\)</span>.</li>

<p>Maybe you have heard someone say something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know what I like; there is a perfect life for me. I simply want everything to look as close to this as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>O-R: “One alternative is “ideal” for the individual; how much he likes every other alternative is determined by the distance of that alternative from the ideal, as given by a function <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. "</p>
</div>
<p>This might be expressed as the preference relation <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span> defined by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x \succsim y \: \leftrightarrow \: d(x) \leq d(y)\]</span></p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>We will return to “distance functions” later. We are all familiar with the ‘Euclidean distance’ function… which happens to represent the actual straight-line distance between two physical objects in three dimensional space. However, there is no obvious single measure of the “distances between two bundles of goods and services, with many measurable attributes.” This issue also comes up in analysis of real considering (e.g.) consumer preferences over different products a firm could manufacture.</p>

<div id="lex-pref" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Lexicographic (‘lex’) preferences</h4>
<p>Remember the Blue Cat in the video? … When he considered his preferences over the teas, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I care first and foremost about whether the tea box is rectangular. If several boxes are equally rectangular, then I care about which box is the most white. If the boxes are equally white, then I care about which box is biggest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to be an example of what we call ‘lexicographic preferences’.</p>
<p><em>Why are lexicographic preferences important</em>? (Think and unfold:)</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>Ask people how they make their choices, particularly when they are shopping online. I bet that some people will describe a process of ‘ruling out’ one set of options after another. This is, in fact an optimal procedure for someone with lex preferences. This is <em>not</em> for someone with the more standard preferences you may have seen in economics courses, someone who considers trade-offs between one attribute and another.</p>
<p>The ‘filtering’ is also consistent with the standard way data is organised. Try to search for a product or service online (on Amazon, or Kayak): it is hard to <em>specify</em> your trade off between different characteristics, but it’s easy to ‘narrow things down’ one category at a time.</p>
<p>In business data science, some ‘tree-based’ models of choice implicitly assume lex preferences. Business marketers speak of ‘hygiene factors’; if these are not achieved, the customer will walk away.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As stated by O-R:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An individual has in mind two [or more] <a href="#Completeness">complete</a> and <a href="#Transitivity">transitive</a> binary relations, <span class="math inline">\(\succsim_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\succsim_2\)</span>, each of which relates to one feature of the alternatives. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a set of computers, the features might be the size of the memory and the resolution of the screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Lexicographic preferences can be applied to any number of features, but we will only consider two features here.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The individual gives priority to the first feature, breaking ties by the second feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Formally, [for lexicographic preferences] the individual’s preference relation <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span> is defined by <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span> if:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="math inline">\(x \succ_1 y\)</span> or</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<h5>Are lex preferences transitive?</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \succsim z\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>To show transitivity by our definition</em>, we now need to show that this neccesarily implies that <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim z\)</span> holds.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Also note that the above example happens to be perfectly general (we sometimes state this as ‘without loss of generality’ or ‘WLOG’). As we have complete preferences, for any three options, it must be that you can choose labels for them x, y, and z, such that <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \succsim z\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are two possible cases:</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Note that these are the <em>only</em> two possible cases. (We know this because case 2 is simply the ‘negation’ of case 1. In standard logic either something is true, or it is not true). Thus if we can prove transitivity for both case 1 and case 2, we have proved it ‘for all possible cases’.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Case 1: “The first feature is decisive when comparing <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(x \succ_1 y\)</span>.”</em></p>
<p><em>Case 2: “The first feature is <em>not</em> decisive when comparing <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>…”</em></p>
<p><strong>Considering Case 1</strong>:</p>
<p>Given, by the above assumption, that <span class="math inline">\(y \succsim z\)</span>, it must be that <span class="math inline">\(y \succsim_1 z\)</span></p>
<p>… i.e., y is “at least as good as z in it’s first feature” – otherwise, according to our preferences, y could not be ‘at least as good as z’).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so by the transitivity of <span class="math inline">\(\succsim_1\)</span> [which was part of the definition of lex preferences]…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we obtain … <span class="math inline">\(x \succ_1 z\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and thus <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim z\)</span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, why does <span class="math inline">\(x \succ_1 y\)</span> combined with <span class="math inline">\(y \succsim_1 z\)</span> imply that <span class="math inline">\(x \succ_1 z\)</span>? (think, and then unfold).</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>This seems intuitively obvious: if ‘x is strictly better than y’ and ‘y is at least as good as z’, then it should be that ‘x is strictly better than z’. But if we are compulsive mathematicians, we would need to actually formally prove this, as Problem 1b requests.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>… And why does <span class="math inline">\(x \succ_1 z\)</span> imply that <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim z\)</span>? (think, and then unfold)</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>By condition (i) in the definition of lex preferences, if <span class="math inline">\(x \succ_1 y\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span>. (Obviously, as this is a general definition, it also applies if we swap z for y in this statement.)</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>…"but wait, why aren’t you stating <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim z\)</span> (‘x is at least as good as z’)… don’t we know that <span class="math inline">\(x \succ z\)</span>, (‘x is strictly preferred to z’)? (unfold)</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>Three responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For this case, <span class="math inline">\(x \succ z\)</span> does not come directly out of the definition of lex preferences. (I think this could be derived, but we do not need to.)</p></li>
<li><p>Our definition of transitivity involves the <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span> operator, and not the <span class="math inline">\(\succ\)</span> operator; we need to prove it precisely as defined.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyways, <span class="math inline">\(x \succ y\)</span> <em>implies</em> <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span> (but not vice versa). <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span> is the ‘weaker’ condition. So if <span class="math inline">\(x \succ y\)</span> is a true statement then <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span> is as well (always).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Wait we are not done! We only proved this for one case; now we must consider the ‘negation’ of this case:</em></p>
<p><strong>Considering Case 2… </strong>: "The first feature is <em>not</em> decisive when comparing <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(x \sim_1 y\)</span></p>
<p>…(and <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim_2 y\)</span> must hold as we assumed that <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span> overall.)</p>
<p>Case 2 is further broken down into two comprehensive sub-cases, which I will call 2a and 2b. Given that the first feature is not decisive for comparing x and y…</p>
<p>…then either the first feature is decisive when comparing y and z (‘case 2a’), or it is not (‘case 2b’).</p>
<p><em>Either… </em></p>
<p><strong>2a:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(y \succ_1 z\)</span></p>
<p>… then … “we obtain <span class="math inline">\(x \succ_1 z\)</span> and therefore <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim z\)</span>.”</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>O-R write that this follows “from the transitivity of <span class="math inline">\(\succ_1\)</span>”.
I believe that here they mean we know that if <span class="math inline">\(A \sim B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B \succ C\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(A \succ C\)</span> by the property of these logical relations <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\succ\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus we must have that <span class="math inline">\(x \sim_1 y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \succ_1 z\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(z \succ_1 z\)</span></p>
</div>
<p><em>or</em></p>
<p><strong>2b:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(y \sim_1 z\)</span></p>
<p>implying that <span class="math inline">\(y \succ_2 z\)</span> for y to be preferred to z overall, as assumed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the transitivity of <span class="math inline">\(\sim_1\)</span> we obtain <span class="math inline">\(x \sim_1 z\)</span> …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(recalling <span class="math inline">\(x \sim_1 y\)</span> is what defined case 2)…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and by the transitivity of <span class="math inline">\(\succsim_2\)</span> we obtain <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim_2 z\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim z\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus we have shown, for all possible cases that, or lexicographic preferences <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span> as defined <a href="pref-util-choice.html#lex-pref">above</a>, <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \succsim z\)</span>, implying that these preferences are transitive.</p>
<p>We can now write <em>quo erat demonstrandum</em> or ‘Q.E.D’, meaning ‘what was to be demonstrated’ [has been demonstrated]. This is sometimes expressed with the symbol</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\blacksquare\]</span>.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Why did we do this??</strong></p>
<p>Gee, this took a long time.</p>
<p>Was it a fun puzzle or a tedious chore? Why did I show you this?</p>
<p>I think it is good for you to get a sense of what mathematical/theoretical economics proofs look like. It’s good for improving the rigorous structure of your arguments in general. It may be helpful for future reading. It helps you be sure that you understand the concepts defined.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, we learned a few concepts here in doing this. I would suggest that we learned things like…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A proof can constructed by demonstrating that something must hold for all possible cases. We can do it by dividing up the space of all possible cases and showing it for each part of this space.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea of “weaker and stronger conditions” (strict vs weak preference)</p></li>
<li><p>How to use ‘general properties of mathematical objects’ (like the transitivity of the <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span> operator) to construct proofs for specific cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Mathematical and logical arguments often contain <em>many simple steps</em>, perhaps too many to keep in your head all at the same time. That’s why it’s important to write things down and not try to do everything in ‘spoken form.’</p></li>
</ul>
However, as this is so time-consuming, and not always insightful, I won’t drag you through all the proofs… only dip in occassionally.

<p>Or, getting back to our basic idea, an individual may simply have preferences over <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> characteristics of an outcome (or a product, or a bundle of products)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Define the binary relation <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim_i y\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i = 1,...,n\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, this may be is a person who says something like:</p>
<p><font color='gray'>I only prefer a holiday in Jamaica to a holiday in France if Jamaica is better than France in all attributes (or vice-versa). Otherwise I can’t say anything about it.</font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Or a group policy-maker who says (unfold):</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>Group PM: “I can only state that we prefer the Conservatives’ policy is better than the Liberals’ if it is better for everyone in our society (or vice-versa). Otherwise, we don’t have a group preference.”</p>
<p>In fact, these precise definitions of preferences, and their characteristics, are useful in considering the idea of ‘public choice’ and social welfare functions. We may derive things like ‘impossibility theorems’ that tell us the limits of what group-decision-making can accomplish.</p>
<p>O-R discuss this in chapter 20, ‘Aggregating preferences’, but we probably won’t have time to cover it directly in this module.</p>

What properties does the ‘Unanimity rule’ preference relation have or not have? (Unfold)

<p><br />
</p>
<p>How do we know it’s transitive? (unfold next section)</p>
</div>

<div class="fold">
<p>Informally ’If X is at least as good as Y in all aspects, and Y is at least as good Z in all aspects, then X is at least as good as Z in all aspects,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How does the example in the prior fold show that it’s not complete? (unfold below)</p>
</div>

<div class="fold">
<p>If ‘two of the relations disagree’ when comparing any two elements in the choice set (x and y), then the condition ‘x is at least as good as y in all aspects’ does not hold, nor does ‘y is at least as good as x in all aspects’ hold. So the unanimity preference relation ‘rule’ does not state that either is preferred.</p>
<p>Maybe this is obvious when you think in the group context: If we can only make a decision if everyone agrees that one option is better than the other, there will be cases where we cannot say either way which is preferred.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The ‘unanimity rule’-based preferences are not complete, which suggests this has limited use as a decision rule (when we get to actual ‘choice’).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>‘Majority rule’ (read about this in O-R) solves this problem but brings another problem, which leads to the ‘Condorcet paradox’, also known as the ‘voting paradox’. After reading this in O-R, unfold below for an example of how this makes it difficult to clearly express ‘public choice’ through majority voting.</p>

<div class="fold">
<p><strong>Voting paradox example</strong></p>
<p>Suppose we are trying to choose, as a society, between three options in our choice set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>: a Green Park, Public Housing, or Private Housing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Suppose we have a local council with one member from each party (representing equal-sized constituencies). Preferences of these groups are as follows (considering strict preferences; as O-R state, the preferences here are ‘anti-symmetric’):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Green party: Green Park <span class="math inline">\(\succ\)</span> Public housing <span class="math inline">\(\succ\)</span> Private housing<br />

<h4>Are preferences transitive in the real world?</h4>
<p>In the <a href="http://gametheory.tau.ac.il/exp11/">O-R questionnaire</a> they asked people to make 36 choices between pairs of alternatives taken from a set of 9 alternatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each alternative is a description of a vacation package with four parameters: the city, hotel quality, food quality, and price.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They varied the ordering of the description of these features.</p>

<div class="note">
You might want to do that survey now if you haven’t done it yet, to understand what we are talking about.
</div>
<p>e.g., one choice could be between</p>
<ul>
<li>“A weekend in Paris, with 4 star hotel, food quality 17, for 574 USD” versus</li>
<li>“A weekend in Berlin, with 5 star hotel, food quality 15, for 500 USD”</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They found that 85% of the roughly 1300 showed at least one ‘intransitivity’, where their stated preferences implied “A is preferred to B”, “B is preferred to C”, and “C is preferred to A” for some combination of three alternatives.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Or they simply reversed themselves, stating ‘A is preferred to B’ in one case and ‘B is preferred to A’ in another case. That is also a violation of transitivity, of course.</p>
</div>
<p>They also note that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the order in which the features of the package are listed has an effect on the expressed preferences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is something we call a ‘framing effect’; the way an option is stated affects people’s choices (or stated preferences).</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>This is a major discussion in behavioral economics. Framing effects include things like ‘anchoring’, ‘halo effects’, ‘decoy effects’, etc. (Look up what some of these mean if you are interesting). Framing effects might be interpreted as a violation of the idea of ‘transitive preferences’. On the other hand, one might argue instead that ‘the frame is itself a characteristic of the product.’</p>
</div>

<div class="inputq">
<strong>Do the results of the O-R survey demonstrate that ‘people frequently exhibit intransitive preferences’?</strong> Consider why this may or may not be considered definitive evidence (and then unfold below for some suggestions.)
</div>
<p><br />
</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>This may be <em>suggestive</em> evidence, but I don’t think it should be considered definitive.</p>
<p>One possible objection… These were ‘hypothetical’ questions; no one was actually making real choices here. In contrast, Economics research usually emphasizes real ‘incentivised’ choices, either in lab or field experiments or relying on ‘observational’ data. Thinking about these choices carefully is mentally costly. Respondents may not have put in the time to carefully consider these choices.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is a great deal of more ‘serious’ evidence of choices that seem to violate transitivity, or extensions of this; we will come back to in the later sections. The <a href="index.html#readings">suggested ‘real research paper’</a> for this section also consider some violations of the idea of a ‘stable consistent set of preferences’, noting that individual’s choices seem to depend on the <em>time of day the choice is made</em> (holding constant the time that the consumption will be realised); see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597898928035">Read and van Leeuwen</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> When can utility functions ‘represent preferences’?</h3>

<div class="note">
The rest of this section in O-R is highly abstract and I don’t see many direct applications to practice. You can skip much of it, but please do cover the parts mentioned below.
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here O-R give a fancy definition of ‘maximal element with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\succsim\)</span>’ … basically, the ‘best or (at least tied-for-best) element in the set, considering these preferences.’</p>
<p>Similarly for the ‘minimal’ element.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>O-R Lemma 1.1 … in any ‘nonempty finite set’ there must be at least one mimal and at least one maximal element. This is pretty obvious and intuitive.</p>
<p>Still, it is worth reading over the <em>proof</em> of this as it gives you an easy example of ‘proof by induction’. The logic of ‘proof by induction’… (to prove that something holds for a set of any countable size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Show statement X holds for the first element (here, for <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>)</li>
<li>Show that ‘if X holds for any element <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> it must also hold for element <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>’</li>
<li>Putting 1 and 2 together, you now know that statement X must always hold (for any countable finite set of some size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>). ‘Just start with the first element and count up to N’.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Aside: is there a ‘smallest interesting integer number’? Can you prove why or why not?</em></p>

<div class="fold">
<p>No, there cannot be, I can ‘prove it’. Suppose there that <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> were the ‘smallest interesting integer’. But then integer <span class="math inline">\(K-1\)</span> would be the ‘largest <em>non-interesting</em> number.’ That fact alone should make it interesting! Therefore, there cannot be any smallest interesting integer!</p>
<p>(I think this passes for a joke in the maths community.)</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The following proposition, and other propositions extending this, are fundamental to the idea that we can conduct our economic analysis <em>as if</em> people actually consulted a utility function. x</p>

<div class="def">
Proposition (O-R 1.1): Every preference relation on a finite set can be represented by a utility function.
</div>
<p>Note that this requires <em>a finite set</em>; this must involve a countable number of elements to choose among. It is not guaranteed (at least not without further conditions) for a preference relation on an infinite set. For example, the set of elements ‘any real number between 0 and 10’ is an infinite set.</p>
<p><em>You may skip the proof of this proposition, if you like.</em></p>
<div id="examples-lexicographic-preferences-on-a-finite-set" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>Examples: lexicographic preferences on a finite set</h4>
<p>Lexicographic preference on a <em>finite</em> set (like the set of seats in a movie theatre) <em>can</em> be represented by a utility function,</p>
<p>Following O-R example 1.2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose an individual prefers to sit as far back as possible (in the highest numbered ‘row’). This is her first priority.</li>
<li>Within any ‘row’ she prefers to sit as far to the left as possible (in the highest numbered ‘column’)</li>
</ul>

<div class="inputq">
Consider, how could you assign a utility function to these preferences?
</div>

<div class="fold">
<p>Just rank the seat preferences, and assign the lowest utility number to the least-preferred seat (most front and right). Then increase the utility by 1 as you move each seet to the left. Then start at the next row back, all the way to the right, adding 1 to the utility, etc.<br />
</p>
<p>O-R give another (equivalent) utility function for this, noting that, for this example there are 40 rows of seats and 50 columns (50 seats per row).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[u(x)=50 r(x) - c(x) + 1\]</span></p>
where <span class="math inline">\(r(x)\)</span> is the row number and <span class="math inline">\(c(x)\)</span> the column number.
(I’m not sure why they added the ‘+1’, there is no need for a utility number to be positive.)

<div id="on-infinite-sets-some-but-not-all-preferences-can-be-represented-by-a-utility-function" class="section level4 unnumbered" number="">
<h4>On infinite sets: <em>some</em> (but not all) preferences can be represented by a utility function</h4>
<p>For example, consider the infinite set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^+\)</span>, the set of all non-negative real numbers. This is a reasonable choice set to consider, perhaps, in some contexts. E.g., ‘I may be able to consume any zero or positive amount of food’ ( note we have not yet brought in <em>constraints</em>, we are just considering <em>preferences</em>).</p>
<p>Suppose ‘I always find more food at least as good as less food’. We could represent this preference as</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(x \geq y\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
This is easily represented bu the utility function <span class="math inline">\(u(x)=x\)</span>.
<div class="marginnote">
<p>… or in fact, by any utility function which is an increasing function, such as $u(x)= x^2 + ln(x) + 108</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In contrast, consider lex preferences on an <em>infinite</em> set, the ‘unit square", where the first priority is the first coordinate and the second priority is the second coordinate. This is like the ’movie theatre’ example, except instead of specific seats, one can locate at any exact point in the square.</p>

The ‘{}’ enclose the definition of the set.
“<span class="math inline">\((x_1,x_2)\)</span>” means we are talking about sets of pairs of elements.

“<span class="math inline">\(x_1,x_2 \in [0,1]\)</span>” means that each of these elements must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to 1. The brackets (“[]”) specify a ‘closed set’ including these boundaries.</p>

</blockquote>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>You may find it more worthwhile to ‘try and fail’ to give a utility function depicting such preferences. Of course, no matter how many times you fail, you have not proved that it is ‘impossible’. But it may help you gain intuition.</p>
</div>
<p>You can skip the following proof.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="an-increasing-function-of-a-regular-utility-function-represents-the-same-preferences" class="section level3" number="2.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> An increasing function of a (‘regular’*) utility function represents the same preferences</h3>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>O-R say ‘Increasing function of utility function is utility function’. But it’s more than this. It’s the <em>same utility function</em>.</p>
<p>* Note that I say ‘regular utility function’. When we consider uncertainty in the ‘expected utility’ framework, this will not hold with respect to ‘increasing transformations’ of the functions we will be dealing with, only with respect to ‘affine (linear) transformations’.</p>
</div>
<p>This is pretty important because it gives us a sense of how closely we might be able to identify a utility function. As O-R note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if the function <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y)\)</span> represents a given preference relation then so does the function <span class="math inline">\(3u(x,y) −7\)</span> [for example]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that even if we knew a persons’ preferences, we wouldn’t know whether the utility function was “actually” <span class="math inline">\(U(Apples, Bananas) = A + B^2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(U(Apples, Bananas) = 4(A + B^2)^3 + 37\)</span> etc. These utility functions express the same preferences.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Utility functions are often interpreted to be simply ‘the thing that drives choices, subject to constraints’, as we will see later. That’s the standard approach at least. We don’t imagine that we can somehow measure an individuals actual ‘amount’ of utility, or to compare whether one person gets ‘more’ or ‘less’ utility than another.</p>
<p>See D. Colander ‘Edgeworth’s Hedonimeter and the Quest to Measure Utility’’ Journal of Economic Perspectives, Spring 2007: 215-225 for a discussion of the history of this idea.</p>
</div>
<p>In general:</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>The notation here is a bit loose perhaps?
When we say <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> we are considering elements <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that may have multiple components… <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> may be a bundle of goods and services, etc., so <span class="math inline">\(u(x)\)</span> may be a function of several variables.</p>

</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The proof is pretty quick and reasonable:</p>

<div class="def">
<p><span class="math inline">\(w(x) \geq w (y)\)</span> means is the same thing as saying <span class="math inline">\(f(u(x)) \geq f(u(y))\)</span>, by the above definition.</p>

<span class="math inline">\(u(x) \geq u(y)\)</span> which is true if and only if <span class="math inline">\(x \succsim y\)</span>, by the definition of utility functions ‘representing preferences.’
