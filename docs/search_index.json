This is… a Microeconomics module. We will learn and use maths and rigorous logic to consider deep questions of: Individual preferences, choices and optimization subject to constraints How individuals interact with one another, and the consequences of this (Game theory and mechanism design/agency problems) “Markets”, prices, and “welfare” (how much value is created, who gets what, how do we consider these outcomes as a society) Psychological influences on the above, and limits to optimization (Behavioral Economics) a Selective and bespoke module We will not cover ‘all of Microeconomics’. I will focus on a limited set of concepts, models and applications (and academic articles) that I hope you will find most interesting and useful. We will skip many major important topics. But that’s OK. We will learn tools, ‘modes of thinking’, and ‘modes of proving results’ that should strengthen your brain muscles and help you understand a much wider body of material. I often focus on models with ‘surprising’ or ‘counter-intuitive’ results. If you can explain the logic behind these (as well as the maths), you have achieved an understanding beyond a layman’s intuition. I will try to incorporate a small set applications that are particularly relevant to your careers and your research interests. , I may also try to incorporate data, statistics/empirical modeling, and ‘computer coding’ because these will be super-important in your career. Please give me feedback on what you are interested in. an Inquisitive module: we ask the ‘how?’, ‘why?’, ‘so what?’, and ‘is this reasonable?’ … of the models and concepts When studying Economics, I often saw models presented, with strong assumptions, without any explanation of what these were for and how they could be justified. In this module we will always be skeptical and carefully ask ‘what is the purpose’ of each model and concept. For example, ‘what does it mean to say that something is a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium?’ … Do we expect people to actually randomise in this way? Level of this module This module is adapted to students from a variety of backgrounds. For students interested in pursuing a PhD in Economics, and interested in research: We will cover some approaches and relevant building blocks, and I will point you to relevant materials for further enrichment I will incorporate content from academic literature (‘articles in peer reviewed journals’) and sophisticated research considerations I will incorporate my own research, research methods, and ‘really getting our hands dirty’ in digging into research questions, building theoretical (maths) models, and even perhaps experiments, coding, and data analysis. We will discuss your proposed research, relate microeconomic theory and models to this, and bring this into coursework I will try to help you ‘think, research and write’ like a good economist. (See my Writing and research guide here. However, please note that will not fully prepare you for doctoral study and academic research that requires advanced Microeconomics. MRes programmes and modules are better geared to this. For students coming from backgrounds with limited Economics training and limited abstract maths: I will explain most concepts ‘from the ground up’, or point you to what you will need to revise. I will present most material also at an intermediate level, using diagrams and simple intuition. But note that you need to have SOME background in Economics to do well in this module. This is an MSc-level Economics module, after all. For students who are not as fluent in English as they would like to be (perhaps many/most of our students): I will try to communicate clearly and at a reasonable pace, avoiding slang and using diagrams and maths to convey ideas Most of what I say in lectures/videos/tutorials is also in writing here in this web book (or in links) I will strongly encourage you to participate actively and try to help you improve your English communication skills. Interacting with my Writing and research guide here should also be helpful for this (and for your dissertation, if you will be writing one). Readings and resources This module will use a variety of resources: I will guide you through this via the online text that you are reading now.. Consider this the ‘governing resource’. This draws heavily from several texts and other resources, all of which are free and available online. I will make it clear what come from where, and where you can find additional readings. In particular: “O-R”: Models in Microeconomic Theory, by Osborne and Rubinstein Our main aim is to give the reader an understanding of the concepts of model and equilibrium in microeconomic theory This book is very precise, abstract (in a mathematical sense), and extremely well-written and full of wisdom and insight. It is dense; don ’t worry if it takes you a long time to digest each concept (but if you get stuck, please do ask questions and try different approaches). It is the most relevant (at least of these three) for further postgraduate/PhD study. The authors claim ‘the mathematics we use is elementary’. However, I think it contains a deep sort of maths that you will find challenging. As they say, ‘many of the proofs involve sustained logical arguments’. [Introduction to Economic Analysis version 2.1 by McAfee, Lewis, and Dale]](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/introduction-to-economic-analysis-v21) This is a more traditional text, with more ‘computational-style’ problems. It covers a wider set of Economics concepts than the others. “QMC”: Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus by Yoram Baumann, the self-proclaimed ‘World’s First Standup Economist’ This is somewhat less rigorous than O-R, but it has its own strengths. It approaches the material in an unusual way, and covers some material that is non traditionally covered in Economics courses (and skips many core concepts). As I am incorporating some material directly from these works, I include the licences below (in the fold). Paste licenses here. Other relevant resources Simpler resources Varian, Hal R., Intermediate microeconomics: a modern approach. New York, NY: WW Norton &amp; Company, 2010: Somewhat less formal than O-R but it also covers a wider set of material and computations. Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder. We have used this for a good chunk of this module in past years. It is at a very basic level, in terms of the maths Free online access to this text may be available through your university/library (this works at Exeter) via www.vlebooks.com A free alternative, at a similar level: Microeconomics an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine Microeconomics by Hugh Gravelle and Ray Rees (version 3, widely available online for free): A somewhat more advanced-intermediate-level text which I think you will find very useful; this is not yet officially Open-Source, but you can find it online for free (and the authors are OK with this, I have emailed them). Just do a web search for ‘Gravelle and Rees Microeconomics’ and you will find the pdf More rigorous, advanced and applied work will draw from David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here)[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/] this will give you a flavor of the PhD level micro David Autor. 14.03 Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy.

Academic articles and working papers as well as some of my own writings… these are mentioned below About this web-book: the Governing Resource Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics I wrote this web-book to outline all of the material you are responsible for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short amount contact time that we have. I don’t mean you’re simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that these notes will aim to refer to everything that you are responsible for. This web-book is meant to be a complement to the texts and readings (and to the lectures/videos, tutorials/problem sets and other material on the ELE) and to tie all of this together. I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in this web-book. However, things may adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to this as we go along. I will keep you informed of any changes via the ELE (VLE) forums and the ELE page in general. Web-book versus slides?: (unfold) At times I will present material using slides. This web-book should include all of the slide material plus explanatory notes and enrichment material. (However, I left out some of the jokes.) I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will also make the slides themselves available even though they are redundant– this web-book has everything that slides have. ‘Markers’, abbreviations, and callouts/boxes OR: Osborne and Rubinstein’s [Models in Microeconomic Theory]((https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/1171) ‘McDL’ refers to the McAfee, Dale and Lewis text ‘QMC’ refers to ‘Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus’ (Baumann) ‘NS’ refers to the Nicholson and Snyder text (usually chapters/numbering from the 12th edition is referenced; if you’re using an earlier edition, make sure the content corresponds) ‘DA’ refers to David Autor’s MIT open courseware notes for Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy Text in brown usually refers to questions you should try to answer on your own (and I sometimes provide suggested answers in a folding box or footnonte. Try to answer it yourself first.) Some text may be given in gray to indicate that this is a side point or a discussion. ‘Comprehension Q:’ A question you should be able to answer if you are following along. Margin notes: (Look on the right… \\(\\rightarrow\\)) These reflect brief comments, hints, side points, or reference links. Folding boxes: I will occasionally put additional material in boxes that can be unfolded. Sometimes I do this with “question and answer” so you’ve an opportunity to consider the answer before peeking. I also will do this with some material that involves a side conversation, or material that is very tangential, and would otherwise clutter up the text. Look in the fold: Greetings from the fold! The weather is nice in here. I will use these boxes for ‘notes’ expressing material that is important, but is somewhat ‘aside’ from the main content. This color of box is used for ‘hints and tips’. Boxes with this color indicate ‘warnings’ … usually highlighting ways that students often misunderstand particular content. Leaving comments and asking questions within this book using Hypothes.is As you read this book, you can put comments/question right in the text, see and respond to other’s questions/comments (these should be highlighted in yellow and) see my answers and responses (I will periodically check this), leave comments and answer specific questions asked in the text, offering me valuable feedback. You can do this using a browser tool called hypothes.is (you can go to their site to learn more about this tool). Sign up for a hypothes.is account (this takes 2 minutes and it’s free). It will be better if you get an account that identifies you to me, so I can follow up with individual feedback and learn more about who you are. However, it’s also fine if you want to make your account ID basically anonymous… or you could even get two accounts, if you prefer. You don’t need to install anything. However, if you install the Hypothes.is plugin for your browser this will give you the additional ability to leave comments on other sites and start private groups. To add a comment or question After you’ve an account (and you are signed in), to add a comment or ask a question here, just: Highlight some text Figure 0.1: highlighting text Click the ‘annotate’ icon that comes up Write your comment or question Write your question in the box (see icons to use math notation and other features) Please add the tag ‘beem101’ to help others search for this. Click ‘post to public’ I will periodically browse and respond. To view existing comments/questions from yourself and others You should see these highlighted in yellow if you are signed in (I think), as well as with little markers with the number ‘1’ on that sidebar If you click the ‘eyeball’ on the side you can turn this off and on If you click the ‘paper’ on the sidebar, you can open up and see the existing notes (and respond to them) Sometimes, in this web-book I will specifically ask you to give answers, suggestions, and feedback on specific questions I will write something like Please let me know how Hypothesis is working for you by leaving a Hypothes.is comment HERE. This means I really want you to put a comment at that point in the web-book, and I’ll be looking for these. Some more cool things about this book Look at the icons that should appear on the top of the page: These allow you to: Hide/show the outline bar Search the full text for a word Change the font style, color, and size Show keyboard shortcuts Figure 0.2: For example, you can choose nighttime serif font Tech details of this book (‘do I call this ’collophon’?) I created this in Rmd (the ‘R languages’ ‘markdown’), including some latex and html code too, with features adapted from the ‘Tufte’ package. This is all put together by Knitr and Bookdown using the ‘Pandoc’ conversion tool into an Html file which I’m hosting via Github pages for now. For details on how this works, I have a guide (to how I work in a similarly constructed ‘bookdown’) HERE.

(\\(\\approx\\) 5%) ### Motivation with puppets {-} Some key questions and topics for this module (video notes below the fold): Key topics: Preferences and choice Supermarket choice example; two ‘decision modes’; business ‘big data modeling’ implications Consumer demand Esp., how it responds to prices and income, and the implications of this. Preferences and choices under (probablistic) uncertainty (building blocks for finance!) How do we value ‘a bundle of possibilities’ against another bundle … and how do we choose among these? Insurance, investments, life choices (university, job), consumer choices ‘Risk aversion’ and the returns to risk (Monopoly) firms: product offerings, pricing and segmentation How do they max (LR) profits in light of consumer choices? What are the implications of this for society? How can they ‘do segmentation’ to boost profits? What do they actually do? (Using data?) Strategic interaction and game theory E.g., ‘which side of the street to walk on?’, ‘how much to charge/produce if there is a competing firm?’, ‘should I ask my partner to marry me?’, ‘how much should a political campaign invest in advertising in a particular state/county?’ Is there an advantage or disadvantage to ‘being the first to make an offer’ in bargaining? When should I wear a mask? What should we predict about ‘who wears a mask’ and what should increase or decrease this? ‘Other-regarding’ preferences (BE) may enter here! Throughout, but with supplements at the end: Behavioural economics Applications and evidence from the real world and the ‘laboratory’ Research and research skills (reading/writing, mathematical modeling, critical thinking, considering applications to the real world and to data, research integrity) Note: contrast from previous years (unfold) The ‘story of this module’ (in the video and fold above) is modified from how I structured it in prior years. In contrast to the approach I’m taking now, Microeconomics is often taught in terms of: ‘building blocks of the market’ on the consumer and producer side putting this together to consider the market in ‘general equilibrium’ under perfect competition, and the welfare consequences of this market failures and departures from perfect competition. This year (in this web book) I’m taking a different path. We are focusing instead on the meaning, tools, and structure of decision-making and on how to consider and apply models. I will put a strong emphasis on uncertainty, strategic interaction, and behavioral economics/psychology. There is less focus on welfare, market equilibrium, or the model of production. Planned syllabus, coverage (detailed) The planned module outline is below. All timings are approximate and may need to be adjusted. Some material may be cut for time constraints. Feel free to skip over the first time you read these notes; you may want to refer to this later. The relevant part of this outline will be repeated at the beginning of each section within this book. Overview of module &amp; rules, discussion/background, Economic models (&amp; maths tools), ‘empirical’ evidence (\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) week) Coverage and notes: below (on the present page) This content will take roughly half a week to cover, but we will return to it later. Models, meaning, metrics, maths revision Interactive exercises (‘problem set’) Sec. 2: Preferences and utility; Choice (1.5 weeks) What can we reasonably say about ‘what people prefer and choose’? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular ‘reasonable’ assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of ‘optimization’? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions? Note on mathematical precision (unfold) This precision is relevant for Behavioral Economics (a specialty of Ariel Rubinstein and an interest of mine). The text involves behavioral economics throughout. … also relevant for building empirical ‘models of consumer choices and preferences’ in business/consulting settings. We approach this in an abstract and logically and mathematically-rigorous, but not highly ‘computational’ way. Even if you have taken Economics as an undergraduate, you may not have seen this approach. We will not always be quite so mathematically rigorous throughout the module. However, I want to give you a ‘flavour’ of this approach and, and the tools at the core of modern microeconomics (and the approach taught in PhD programmes). Readings: see sec. (#reading-prefs) [Interactive exercises](#pref-exc} (‘problem set’) To be determined (‘tbd’). Sec. @ref{#uncertainty} Preferences under uncertainty (and over time) ‘Expected Utility’ risk-aversion, finance and diversification time-preference and discounting (1 week) With uncertainty (outcomes are unknown when choices are made, but we assume the probabilities of outcomes are known), again … What can we reasonably say about ‘what people prefer and choose’? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular ‘reasonable’ assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of ‘optimization’? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions? Applications (esp. to finance): How do we express and measure ‘risk aversion’? How does this affect (financial, investment, insurance) choices? Why does ‘diversification improve outcomes for the risk-averse’? How does this affect asset prices (Stocks, bonds, etc.) with ‘efficient markets’ (this will be briefly defined) Behavioral Economics: the “Allais Paradox” (first treatment, time-permitting) Brief (first) presentation: Preferences (and optimization over) assets and consumption over time; ‘discounting’ Main Readings: Web book, and also… O-R Chapter 3: “Preferences under Uncertainty” Feel free to skip the proof of propositions 3.2 (‘Continuity and independence implies EU’). It’s interesting but we can’t cover everything. If you don’t understand the proof of prop. 3.3. (the equivalence of risk aversion and the concavity of the Bernoulli function) that’s also OK.

Proof-based problem Example-based problem (lotteries, insurance, investment) Allais Paradox question Potentially: data/code based simulation Discussion/explanation question Consumer preferences, indifference curves/sets (0.5 weeks) O-R Chapter 4, selected parts Note this chapter covers only a simple 2-good example. If time permits, we will consider the properties of examples with “\\(N&gt;2\\) goods”; \\(N&gt;2\\) is necessary to consider reasonable substitution patterns between goods for many applications. You will also probably learn the N-good optimisation in your maths module.

Interactive exercises (‘problem set’) Tbd (unfold for possibilities) Something about finding departures from the WARP in real data O-R problem 5 (introduces the ‘expenditure function’) O-R problem 8-9 (re-)introduce ‘time preferences’ Noting a major “skip” Note here that we are SKIPPING several key topics in consumer demand (unfold) In the consumer behavior, we are skipping core topics including formal definitions of Hicksian demand, substitution and income effects, and the Slutsky decomposition. These are important for characterizing the welfare effects of price changes and policy changes (including taxation), and for conceptualizing issues involving multiple constraints on consumer optimization (e.g., rationing). I will provide notes on these for anyone who is interested. We are also skipping most of the ‘production side’ (skipped material in fold) Production functions, firm optimisation Perfect competition/competitive equilibrium; short and long run Supply and demand systems General equilibrium and it’s welfare properties Market failures, including externalities/public goods (although these come back as examples in our Game Theory discussion) We this skip these chapters in the text(s). So skip O-R chapter 6 and skip any material on this in the other texts. (Or read it if you want to; you might find it useful in getting an overall picture, but it’s up to you.) To the extent that these are relevant to material we cover later, I will give you the ‘short version’ when it comes up. ‘Monopolies and pricing of profit-maximizing price-setting firms’ (especially monopolies); [price discrimination/market segmentation[(#pd) (1.5 weeks) How would a firm that knows all the stuff above about consumer demand set prices in order to maximise its profit? What if it can segment its customers into different ‘markets’ with distinct demand functions? What are the consequences of all of this for profit and welfare? Today’s businesses, consultants, data analysts, and regulators are extremely interested in these questions. This is a very practical topic. We will consider it both from the theoretical optimization point view (while always gaining insights from the maths). We will also dig into “what do firms actually do in setting pricing” and “how can data be used to do this better?” Main reading O-R ch. 7 “Monopoly” We will focus on the (standard) profit-maximisation goal, although their discussion of other goals is interesting. They define consumer and producer surplus here to give a brief treatment of the deadweight loss of monopoly. They also have a very interesting treatment of the two main types of price discrimination; ‘Implicit discrimination’ foreshadows asymmetric information and agency problems. There are various names of each of these … I am familiar with “second degree = self-selection” and “third degree or ‘explicit segmentation’”. They call the latter ’Implicit discrimination. Alternative treatments (unfold): McDL: Ch 15 – Monopoly NS: 11.2-11.4 QMC: Appendix A.1 - Monopoly - the vanilla version Supplementary recommended readings (unfold): Article: Should we help companies tailor prices to your wage packet? With accompanying worked examples More advanced: ‘The Government May Want to Encourage Price Discrimination by Income’ Linked here Material from data science and industry pricing practice to be incorporated here Interactive exercises (‘problem set’) (tbd; unfold) OR question 1, double marginalization (very relevant and interesting!) OR question 5-7 Possible exercise involving data and ‘choosing a firm’s best price and segmentation’ Notes: Mid-term examination, and a major “skip” We will have a mid-term examination at this point in the module. This examination will cover all of the material up to this point, but it will be more heavily-focused on the earlier material. Note that here we are largely skipping ‘imperfect competition’ and interactions between firms. We may come back to this briefly in our ‘game theory’ examples. Strategic interactions: Game theory (and evidence) (1.5 weeks) The outcomes we care about don’t only depend on what we choose, but on what others’ choose (and perhaps we can also influence the latter). How should we think about choices and outcomes in such settings? What will we predict will happen in single or repeated interactions, and what will affect these outcomes? Strategic interactions Stating the game in ‘normal’ form Dominance, iterated dominance, Rationalisability Best response functions, Nash equilibrium in pure and mixed strategies (if time is tight we may skip mixed strategies) Extensive-form games; sequential aand repeated games Backwards induction and Subgame Perfection (subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium) Infinitely or indefinitely repeated games Games of imperfect information Behavioral economics: transforming material payoffs into true payoffs Evidence on play in strategic situations, including in ‘experiments’ Time-permitting: Research applications to ‘Marriage markets and Tinder’, ‘Fair trade and consumer altruism’ Here the web-book is a key resource. We will incorporate material from: O-R Chapters 15-16 Skip sections 15.5 (Strictly competitive games), and 15.6 (Kantian equilibrium) In chapter 16, we may or may not skip the formal depiction of extensive/sequential games; this depends on our timing In addition to (some) of the Game Theory material covered in O-R: We will also focus on ‘Dominant strategies’, and ‘Iterated-strict-dominance’. Compared to ‘Nash equilibria’, these are (IMHO) more justifiable as predictors of choices especially in one-shot games. We will consider games involving asymmetric information, especially ‘signaling games’ Alternative resources (unfold): QMC: Ch 9, 10, 12 (includes ‘iterated dominance’) McDL: Ch 16 NS: Ch 5 (parts) Several additional concepts from handout, plus supplement on experiments Supplementary recommended readings (unfold): Spence, M.

For this project you will construct, evaluate and discuss one or more mathematical models dealing with a specific applied or theoretical economics research question. (I will also consider an empirical project if you can strongly connect it to the material taught in this module.) Ideally, this will be related to the work you intend to pursue for your MSc dissertation. You will be required to present and discuss this work in a short live session. This project can be an individual project or done in a group of 2-3 people. If it is done as a group, each student will also be asked to present a single page outlining their own contribution to the project, and each will be required to present the work to me individually. Further details and parameters will be given. In the final half week, we will discuss this project. A key reading/resource: Researching and writing for Economics students, by David Reinstein Supplement (optional): Asymmetric information (Moral hazard, adverse selection, signaling) and applications ‘Principal-agent’ models to be integrated into lecture notes Moral hazard and incentives ‘Lemons model’ Hidden information about types/adverse-selection (time-permitting) ‘Live research’ application (time-permitting): Financial market micro-structure and government policy Readings (tbd, unfold): O-R Chapter 14 on a market with Asymmetric Information (a highly formal treatment of the adverse-selection context) Scheduled lectures/tutorials, rules for assesment: see ELE page and module descriptor The assesment is likely to be a combination of a midterm examination, and a project and presentation due by end of term. As of 16 Aug 2020 I am waiting for final approval on this. "],

A very simple undergraduate discussion of ‘what is Economics, what are models’ etc. You probably already know this but take a look just in case.

Classic but perhaps outdated Sugden, Robert. “Credible worlds: the status of theoretical models in economics.” Journal of Economic Methodology 7.1 (2000): 1-31. Sugden, Robert; Sitzia, Stefania. “Implementing theoretical models in the laboratory, and what this can and cannot achieve.” Journal of Economic Methodology, Vol. 18, 2011, p. 323-343. We will return to the issues of ‘what and why models’ throughout the module. Empirics, maths revision Some of the maths you need will also be simultaneously covered in your Optimisation and Econometric modules, sometimes at a higher level. Discussion of ‘empirical identification’: The mixtape, Scott Cunningham pp 18-22 Math revision concepts in DA lecture 3; we may not use all of this QMC 1.3 (some good stuff; don’t worry too much about all the derivative rules) The key maths concept for this module: The logic and language of formal definitions and proofs, e.g., ‘proof by contadiction’, and ‘proof by construction’. What is Economics? Note: DR: It has changed. There are different views. Ask two economists, and you’ll probably get at least three answers. What is Economics? Please propose a definition (from your head… give your own impression) as a comment HERE using Hypothes.is. Then unfold the box below to see some proposed definitions and ideas. “Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.” “Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” Alfred Marshall – The first quote suggests an approach (how we do our research), the second suggests a domain (what we focus on). Another famous quote: “Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.” - Ludwig von Mises What is Microeconomics? One definition: “The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets.”\" Largely, using theoretical and mathematical ‘models’ that depend on strong assumptions. Comprehension Q: Consider some examples of ‘relevant choices’ for economic study. Students: please propose some of these as a Hypothes.is comment HERE. For help on using hypothes.is please see ABOVE or go to https://web.hypothes.is/. What sort of models are we talking about?… To refresh your memory… you have probably seen some of these models before in your previous economics module. You should have some familiarity with the simple models of supply and demand curves yielding an equilibrium price and quantity. You may also have seen a models of trade, between two countries or two individuals, with only two goods, where for each good one has a ‘comparative advantage’. Other models involve ‘strategic’ interactions bwtween a few ‘players’. Others involve individual ‘optimizing’ choices. Still others involve firms and governments setting ‘mechanisms’ trying to induce particular choices by others. Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications. A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and ‘general’; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications. But I don’t find it satisfactory if people respond to a meaningful criticism of a model and the way it is being applied with ‘it’s just a model, and all models are abstractions.’ Specific critiques need to be dealt with directly. The content and meaning of Economic models, theories, and analysis I will add a great deal of content here shortly. Interactive exercises (‘problem set’): Discussion and brief writing/speaking exercise on ‘what Economic models are for’, examples of models. "],
["pref-util-choice.html", "2 Preferences, Utility and Choice 2.1 Reading", " 2 Preferences, Utility and Choice What can we reasonably say about ‘what people prefer and choose’? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular ‘reasonable’ assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of ‘optimization’? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions? Digging deeply into the logic and justifications for these models of choice, and alternative frameworks, will be very relevant in considering Behavioral Economics (This is a specialty of Ariel Rubinstein, one of the O-R text’s two authors, and also a research interest of mine). In fact this text works behavioral economics in from the beginning. This is also relevant for building empirical models such as ‘models of consumer choices and preferences’ in ways that are relevant to (e.g.) Business-data-analytics consulting. We approach this in an abstract and logically and mathematically-rigorous, but not highly ‘computational’ way. Even if you have taken Economics as an undergraduate, you may not have seen this approach. We will not always be quite so mathematically rigorous throughout the module. However, I want to at least give you some of these tools, and a ‘flavour’ of this approach, which characterises modern Microeconomics (and will be at the core of PhD modules). 2.1 Reading Main reading (largely integrated into web book): O-R Chapters 1-2 (we will focus on selected material as described in this web book, but feel free to read these chapters in their entirety if you find it interesting; it all may be useful for your project, dissertation, and future work and study) Note: Within O-R chapter 1, feel free to skip the proof of propositions 1.1 (‘representing preferences by utility functions’) and 1.2 (‘Preference relation not represented by utility function’) Alternative treatments for some of this material (read this if you need a different approach than the ones O-R are taking)… unfold McDL: Ch 12, plus ‘preference relations’ Here is a version we can write dropbox notes in AUT: Lecture 3 - Axioms of Consumer Preference and the Theory of Choice (note, slightly different notation) NS: Ch 2 Readings: ‘real research papers’ Supplementary and conceptual readings (please read at least some of these): Sugden, Robert. “Looking for a Psychology for the Inner Rational Agent.” Social Theory and Practice 41, no. 4 (2015): 579-98..
