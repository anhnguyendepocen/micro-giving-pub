This is… a Microeconomics module. We will learn and use maths and rigorous logic to consider deep questions of: Individual preferences, choices and optimization subject to constraints How individuals interact with one another, and the consequences of this (Game theory and mechanism design/agency problems) “Markets”, prices, and “welfare” (how much value is created, who gets what, how do we consider these outcomes as a society) Psychological influences on the above, and limits to optimization (Behavioral Economics) a Selective and bespoke module We will not cover ‘all of Microeconomics’. I will focus on a limited set of concepts, models and applications (and academic articles) that I hope you will find most interesting and useful. We will skip many major important topics. But that’s OK. We will learn tools, ‘modes of thinking’, and ‘modes of proving results’ that should strengthen your brain muscles and help you understand a much wider body of material. I often focus on models with ‘surprising’ or ‘counter-intuitive’ results. If you can explain the logic behind these (as well as the maths), you have achieved an understanding beyond a layman’s intuition. I will try to incorporate a small set applications that are particularly relevant to your careers and your research interests. , I may also try to incorporate data, statistics/empirical modeling, and ‘computer coding’ because these will be super-important in your career. Please give me feedback on what you are interested in. an Inquisitive module: we ask the ‘how?’, ‘why?’, ‘so what?’, and ‘is this reasonable?’ … of the models and concepts When studying Economics, I often saw models presented, with strong assumptions, without any explanation of what these were for and how they could be justified. In this module we will always be skeptical and carefully ask ‘what is the purpose’ of each model and concept. For example, ‘what does it mean to say that something is a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium?’ … Do we expect people to actually randomise in this way? Level of this module This module is adapted to students from a variety of backgrounds. For students interested in pursuing a PhD in Economics, and interested in research: We will cover some approaches and relevant building blocks, and I will point you to relevant materials for further enrichment I will incorporate content from academic literature (‘articles in peer reviewed journals’) and sophisticated research considerations I will incorporate my own research, research methods, and ‘really getting our hands dirty’ in digging into research questions, building theoretical (maths) models, and even perhaps experiments, coding, and data analysis. We will discuss your proposed research, relate microeconomic theory and models to this, and bring this into coursework I will try to help you ‘think, research and write’ like a good economist. (See my Writing and research guide here. However, please note that will not fully prepare you for doctoral study and academic research that requires advanced Microeconomics. MRes programmes and modules are better geared to this. For students coming from backgrounds with limited Economics training and limited abstract maths: I will explain most concepts ‘from the ground up’, or point you to what you will need to revise. I will present most material also at an intermediate level, using diagrams and simple intuition. But note that you need to have SOME background in Economics to do well in this module. This is an MSc-level Economics module, after all. For students who are not as fluent in English as they would like to be (perhaps many/most of our students): I will try to communicate clearly and at a reasonable pace, avoiding slang and using diagrams and maths to convey ideas Most of what I say in lectures/videos/tutorials is also in writing here in this web book (or in links) I will strongly encourage you to participate actively and try to help you improve your English communication skills. Interacting with my Writing and research guide here should also be helpful for this (and for your dissertation, if you will be writing one). Readings and resources This module will use a variety of resources: I will guide you through this via the online text that you are reading now.. Consider this the ‘governing resource’. This draws heavily from several texts and other resources, all of which are free and available online. I will make it clear what come from where, and where you can find additional readings. In particular: “O-R”: Models in Microeconomic Theory, by Osborne and Rubinstein Our main aim is to give the reader an understanding of the concepts of model and equilibrium in microeconomic theory This book is very precise, abstract (in a mathematical sense), and extremely well-written and full of wisdom and insight. It is dense; don ’t worry if it takes you a long time to digest each concept (but if you get stuck, please do ask questions and try different approaches). It is the most relevant (at least of these three) for further postgraduate/PhD study. The authors claim ‘the mathematics we use is elementary’. However, I think it contains a deep sort of maths that you will find challenging. As they say, ‘many of the proofs involve sustained logical arguments’. [Introduction to Economic Analysis version 2.1 by McAfee, Lewis, and Dale]](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/introduction-to-economic-analysis-v21) This is a more traditional text, with more ‘computational-style’ problems. It covers a wider set of Economics concepts than the others. “QMC”: Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus by Yoram Baumann, the self-proclaimed ‘World’s First Standup Economist’ This is somewhat less rigorous than O-R, but it has its own strengths. It approaches the material in an unusual way, and covers some material that is non traditionally covered in Economics courses (and skips many core concepts). As I am incorporating some material directly from these works, I include the licences below (in the fold). Paste licenses here. Other relevant resources Simpler resources Varian, Hal R., Intermediate microeconomics: a modern approach. New York, NY: WW Norton &amp; Company, 2010: Somewhat less formal than O-R but it also covers a wider set of material and computations. Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder. We have used this for a good chunk of this module in past years. It is at a very basic level, in terms of the maths Free online access to this text may be available through your university/library (this works at Exeter) via www.vlebooks.com A free alternative, at a similar level: Microeconomics an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine Microeconomics by Hugh Gravelle and Ray Rees (version 3, widely available online for free): A somewhat more advanced-intermediate-level text which I think you will find very useful; this is not yet officially Open-Source, but you can find it online for free (and the authors are OK with this, I have emailed them). Just do a web search for ‘Gravelle and Rees Microeconomics’ and you will find the pdf More rigorous, advanced and applied work will draw from David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here)[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/] this will give you a flavor of the PhD level micro David Autor. 14.03 Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy.

Academic articles and working papers as well as some of my own writings… these are mentioned below About this web-book: the Governing Resource Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics I wrote this web-book to outline all of the material you are responsible for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short amount contact time that we have. I don’t mean you’re simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that these notes will aim to refer to everything that you are responsible for. This web-book is meant to be a complement to the texts and readings (and to the lectures/videos, tutorials/problem sets and other material on the ELE) and to tie all of this together. I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in this web-book. However, things may adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to this as we go along. I will keep you informed of any changes via the ELE (VLE) forums and the ELE page in general. Web-book versus slides?: (unfold) At times I will present material using slides. This web-book should include all of the slide material plus explanatory notes and enrichment material. (However, I left out some of the jokes.) I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will also make the slides themselves available even though they are redundant– this web-book has everything that slides have. ‘Markers’, abbreviations, and callouts/boxes OR: Osborne and Rubinstein’s [Models in Microeconomic Theory]((https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/1171) ‘McDL’ refers to the McAfee, Dale and Lewis text ‘QMC’ refers to ‘Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus’ (Baumann) ‘NS’ refers to the Nicholson and Snyder text (usually chapters/numbering from the 12th edition is referenced; if you’re using an earlier edition, make sure the content corresponds) ‘DA’ refers to David Autor’s MIT open courseware notes for Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy Text in brown usually refers to questions you should try to answer on your own (and I sometimes provide suggested answers in a folding box or footnonte. Try to answer it yourself first.) Some text may be given in gray to indicate that this is a side point or a discussion. ‘Comprehension Q:’ A question you should be able to answer if you are following along. Margin notes: (Look on the right… \\(\\rightarrow\\)) These reflect brief comments, hints, side points, or reference links. Folding boxes: I will occasionally put additional material in boxes that can be unfolded. Sometimes I do this with “question and answer” so you’ve an opportunity to consider the answer before peeking. I also will do this with some material that involves a side conversation, or material that is very tangential, and would otherwise clutter up the text. Look in the fold: Greetings from the fold! The weather is nice in here. I will use these boxes for ‘notes’ expressing material that is important, but is somewhat ‘aside’ from the main content. This color of box is used for ‘hints and tips’. Boxes with this color indicate ‘warnings’ … usually highlighting ways that students often misunderstand particular content. Leaving comments and asking questions within this book using Hypothes.is As you read this book, you can put comments/question right in the text, see and respond to other’s questions/comments (these should be highlighted in yellow and) see my answers and responses (I will periodically check this), leave comments and answer specific questions asked in the text, offering me valuable feedback. You can do this using a browser tool called hypothes.is (you can go to their site to learn more about this tool). Sign up for a hypothes.is account (this takes 2 minutes and it’s free). It will be better if you get an account that identifies you to me, so I can follow up with individual feedback and learn more about who you are. However, it’s also fine if you want to make your account ID basically anonymous… or you could even get two accounts, if you prefer. You don’t need to install anything. However, if you install the Hypothes.is plugin for your browser this will give you the additional ability to leave comments on other sites and start private groups. To add a comment or question After you’ve an account (and you are signed in), to add a comment or ask a question here, just: Highlight some text Figure 0.1: highlighting text Click the ‘annotate’ icon that comes up Write your comment or question Write your question in the box (see icons to use math notation and other features) Please add the tag ‘beem101’ to help others search for this. Click ‘post to public’ I will periodically browse and respond. To view existing comments/questions from yourself and others You should see these highlighted in yellow if you are signed in (I think), as well as with little markers with the number ‘1’ on that sidebar If you click the ‘eyeball’ on the side you can turn this off and on If you click the ‘paper’ on the sidebar, you can open up and see the existing notes (and respond to them) Sometimes, in this web-book I will specifically ask you to give answers, suggestions, and feedback on specific questions I will write something in a box like the one below Please let me know how Hypothesis is working for you by leaving a Hypothes.is comment HERE. This means I really want you to put a comment exactly at that point in the web-book, and I’ll be watching for these. Some more cool things about this book Look at the icons that should appear on the top of the page: These allow you to: Hide/show the outline bar Search the full text for a word Change the font style, color, and size Show keyboard shortcuts Figure 0.2: For example, you can choose nighttime serif font Tech details of this book (‘do I call this ’collophon’?) I created this in Rmd (the ‘R languages’ ‘markdown’), including some latex and html code too, with features adapted from the ‘Tufte’ package. This is all put together by Knitr and Bookdown using the ‘Pandoc’ conversion tool into an Html file which I’m hosting via Github pages for now. For details on how this works, I have a guide (to how I work in a similarly constructed ‘bookdown’) HERE.

Respond to the discussion questions and get feedback. Learn from the ‘ground up’: You cannot ‘skip’ learning steps. If you do not understand the concept behind the concept being explained, go back and learn it. Care about the content: Care about actually understanding this stuff. This will be rewarded. Don’t try to game this. It’s easier and better to just learn this stuff. Try to achieve Real Understanding: Be able to explain this stuff in your own words (in writing) and apply it to new situations Interact and discuss: Peers, Forum, office hours (see above) Be careful you know how to interpret the midterm exam instructions correctly, as well as the instructions for the project. Use your time wisely. For the project: start writing and outlining as you begin and as you progress – don’t wait to write things down. Be in contact with me (and your fellow students) to continually discuss how this is going. Skills to hone and build. Your success in this module will depend in large part on building and applying maths skills and tools, as well as strong reading/writing/logic and communication abilities. You should build the ability to comprehend and respond carefully and logically to nuanced questions, in careful writing, orally, in maths, and in diagrams. Be able to incorporate quantitative reasoning, logic, and the ability to understand and clearly express ideas, to correctly characterise and describe theories and evidence, and to apply learned principles to new situations. تحذير, 警报, ескерту, การเตือ, चेतावनीน: Suggestion 4 is especially relevant for non-native speakers of English. See also: Some ‘Fortune Cookie Wisdom’ that may help you think about the material in this module, and Economics in general. Although we are not focusing on ‘market failure’ in this module (BEEM101, 2020), there are some interesting examples I often discuss, of how these can lead to business opportunities. See this supplement… and let me know your thoughts. "],

(\\(\\approx\\) 5%) ### Motivation with puppets {-} Some key questions and topics for this module (video notes below the fold): Key topics: Preferences and choice Supermarket choice example; two ‘decision modes’; business ‘big data modeling’ implications Consumer demand Esp., how it responds to prices and income, and the implications of this. Preferences and choices under (probablistic) uncertainty (building blocks for finance!) How do we value ‘a bundle of possibilities’ against another bundle … and how do we choose among these? Insurance, investments, life choices (university, job), consumer choices ‘Risk aversion’ and the returns to risk (Monopoly) firms: product offerings, pricing and segmentation How do they max (LR) profits in light of consumer choices? What are the implications of this for society? How can they ‘do segmentation’ to boost profits? What do they actually do? (Using data?) Strategic interaction and game theory E.g., ‘which side of the street to walk on?’, ‘how much to charge/produce if there is a competing firm?’, ‘should I ask my partner to marry me?’, ‘how much should a political campaign invest in advertising in a particular state/county?’ Is there an advantage or disadvantage to ‘being the first to make an offer’ in bargaining? When should I wear a mask? What should we predict about ‘who wears a mask’ and what should increase or decrease this? ‘Other-regarding’ preferences (BE) may enter here! Throughout, but with supplements at the end: Behavioural economics Applications and evidence from the real world and the ‘laboratory’ Research and research skills (reading/writing, mathematical modeling, critical thinking, considering applications to the real world and to data, research integrity) Note: contrast from previous years (unfold) The ‘story of this module’ (in the video and fold above) is modified from how I structured it in prior years. In contrast to the approach I’m taking now, Microeconomics is often taught in terms of: ‘building blocks of the market’ on the consumer and producer side putting this together to consider the market in ‘general equilibrium’ under perfect competition, and the welfare consequences of this market failures and departures from perfect competition. This year (in this web book) I’m taking a different path. We are focusing instead on the meaning, tools, and structure of decision-making and on how to consider and apply models. I will put a strong emphasis on uncertainty, strategic interaction, and behavioral economics/psychology. There is less focus on welfare, market equilibrium, or the model of production. Planned syllabus, coverage (detailed) The planned module outline is below. All timings are approximate and may need to be adjusted. Some material may be cut for time constraints. Feel free to skip over the first time you read these notes; you may want to refer to this later. The relevant part of this outline will be repeated at the beginning of each section within this book. Overview of module &amp; rules, discussion/background, Economic models (&amp; maths tools), ‘empirical’ evidence (\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) week) Coverage and notes: below (on the present page) This content will take roughly half a week to cover, but we will return to it later. Models, meaning, metrics, maths revision Interactive exercises (‘problem set’) Sec. 2: Preferences and utility; Choice (1.5 weeks) What can we reasonably say about ‘what people prefer and choose’? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular ‘reasonable’ assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of ‘optimization’? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions? Note on mathematical precision (unfold) This precision is relevant for Behavioral Economics (a specialty of Ariel Rubinstein and an interest of mine). The text involves behavioral economics throughout. … also relevant for building empirical ‘models of consumer choices and preferences’ in business/consulting settings. We approach this in an abstract and logically and mathematically-rigorous, but not highly ‘computational’ way. Even if you have taken Economics as an undergraduate, you may not have seen this approach. We will not always be quite so mathematically rigorous throughout the module. However, I want to give you a ‘flavour’ of this approach and, and the tools at the core of modern microeconomics (and the approach taught in PhD programmes). Readings: see sec. (#reading-prefs) [Interactive exercises](#pref-exc} (‘problem set’) To be determined (‘tbd’). Sec. @ref{#uncertainty} Preferences under uncertainty (and over time) ‘Expected Utility’ risk-aversion, finance and diversification time-preference and discounting (1 week) With uncertainty (outcomes are unknown when choices are made, but we assume the probabilities of outcomes are known), again … What can we reasonably say about ‘what people prefer and choose’? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular ‘reasonable’ assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of ‘optimization’? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions? Applications (esp. to finance): How do we express and measure ‘risk aversion’? How does this affect (financial, investment, insurance) choices? Why does ‘diversification improve outcomes for the risk-averse’? How does this affect asset prices (Stocks, bonds, etc.) with ‘efficient markets’ (this will be briefly defined) Behavioral Economics: the “Allais Paradox” (first treatment, time-permitting) Brief (first) presentation: Preferences (and optimization over) assets and consumption over time; ‘discounting’ Main Readings: Web book, and also… O-R Chapter 3: “Preferences under Uncertainty” Feel free to skip the proof of propositions 3.2 (‘Continuity and independence implies EU’). It’s interesting but we can’t cover everything. If you don’t understand the proof of prop. 3.3. (the equivalence of risk aversion and the concavity of the Bernoulli function) that’s also OK.

Interactive exercises (‘problem set’) Tbd (unfold for possibilities) Something about finding departures from the WARP in real data O-R problem 5 (introduces the ‘expenditure function’) O-R problem 8-9 (re-)introduce ‘time preferences’ Noting a major “skip” Note here that we are SKIPPING several key topics in consumer demand (unfold) In the consumer behavior, we are skipping core topics including formal definitions of Hicksian demand, substitution and income effects, and the Slutsky decomposition. These are important for characterizing the welfare effects of price changes and policy changes (including taxation), and for conceptualizing issues involving multiple constraints on consumer optimization (e.g., rationing). I will provide notes on these for anyone who is interested. We are also skipping most of the ‘production side’ (skipped material in fold) Production functions, firm optimisation Perfect competition/competitive equilibrium; short and long run Supply and demand systems General equilibrium and it’s welfare properties Market failures, including externalities/public goods (although these come back as examples in our Game Theory discussion) We this skip these chapters in the text(s). So skip O-R chapter 6 and skip any material on this in the other texts. (Or read it if you want to; you might find it useful in getting an overall picture, but it’s up to you.) To the extent that these are relevant to material we cover later, I will give you the ‘short version’ when it comes up. ‘Monopolies and pricing of profit-maximizing price-setting firms’ (especially monopolies); [price discrimination/market segmentation[(#pd) (1.5 weeks) How would a firm that knows all the stuff above about consumer demand set prices in order to maximise its profit? What if it can segment its customers into different ‘markets’ with distinct demand functions? What are the consequences of all of this for profit and welfare? Today’s businesses, consultants, data analysts, and regulators are extremely interested in these questions. This is a very practical topic. We will consider it both from the theoretical optimization point view (while always gaining insights from the maths). We will also dig into “what do firms actually do in setting pricing” and “how can data be used to do this better?” Main reading O-R ch. 7 “Monopoly” We will focus on the (standard) profit-maximisation goal, although their discussion of other goals is interesting. They define consumer and producer surplus here to give a brief treatment of the deadweight loss of monopoly. They also have a very interesting treatment of the two main types of price discrimination; ‘Implicit discrimination’ foreshadows asymmetric information and agency problems.

This examination will cover all of the material up to this point, but it will be more heavily-focused on the earlier material. Note that here we are largely skipping ‘imperfect competition’ and interactions between firms. We may come back to this briefly in our ‘game theory’ examples. Strategic interactions: Game theory (and evidence) (1.5 weeks) The outcomes we care about don’t only depend on what we choose, but on what others’ choose (and perhaps we can also influence the latter). How should we think about choices and outcomes in such settings? What will we predict will happen in single or repeated interactions, and what will affect these outcomes? Strategic interactions Stating the game in ‘normal’ form Dominance, iterated dominance, Rationalisability Best response functions, Nash equilibrium in pure and mixed strategies (if time is tight we may skip mixed strategies) Extensive-form games; sequential aand repeated games Backwards induction and Subgame Perfection (subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium) Infinitely or indefinitely repeated games Games of imperfect information Behavioral economics: transforming material payoffs into true payoffs Evidence on play in strategic situations, including in ‘experiments’ Time-permitting: Research applications to ‘Marriage markets and Tinder’, ‘Fair trade and consumer altruism’ Here the web-book is a key resource. We will incorporate material from: O-R Chapters 15-16 Skip sections 15.5 (Strictly competitive games), and 15.6 (Kantian equilibrium) In chapter 16, we may or may not skip the formal depiction of extensive/sequential games; this depends on our timing In addition to (some) of the Game Theory material covered in O-R: We will also focus on ‘Dominant strategies’, and ‘Iterated-strict-dominance’. Compared to ‘Nash equilibria’, these are (IMHO) more justifiable as predictors of choices especially in one-shot games. We will consider games involving asymmetric information, especially ‘signaling games’ Alternative resources (unfold): QMC: Ch 9, 10, 12 (includes ‘iterated dominance’) McDL: Ch 16 NS: Ch 5 (parts) Several additional concepts from handout, plus supplement on experiments Supplementary recommended readings (unfold): Spence, M.

For this project you will construct, evaluate and discuss one or more mathematical models dealing with a specific applied or theoretical economics research question. (I will also consider an empirical project if you can strongly connect it to the material taught in this module.) Ideally, this will be related to the work you intend to pursue for your MSc dissertation. You will be required to present and discuss this work in a short live session. This project can be an individual project or done in a group of 2-3 people. If it is done as a group, each student will also be asked to present a single page outlining their own contribution to the project, and each will be required to present the work to me individually. Further details and parameters will be given. In the final half week, we will discuss this project.

A very simple undergraduate discussion of ‘what is Economics, what are models’ etc. You probably already know this but take a look just in case. Friedman, Milton. “The methodology of positive economics.” (1953): 259. Classic but perhaps outdated Sugden, Robert. “Credible worlds: the status of theoretical models in economics.” Journal of Economic Methodology 7.1 (2000): 1-31. Sugden, Robert; Sitzia, Stefania. “Implementing theoretical models in the laboratory, and what this can and cannot achieve.” Journal of Economic Methodology, Vol. 18, 2011, p. 323-343. We will return to the issues of ‘what and why models’ throughout the module. 1.1 Empirics, maths revision Some of the maths you need will also be simultaneously covered in your Optimisation and Econometric modules, sometimes at a higher level. We will use some maths in this module, and now would be a good time to revise some of this on your own. Here are some key elements. We will consider the use of microeconomics in ‘empirical identification’ of effects using data. The mixtape, Scott Cunningham pp 18-22, provides a good introduction to this So called ‘pre-calculus’ and general maths concepts including The symbolic language and notation of maths Multivariate and univariate functions (and mappings), inverses of functions, implicit functions Summation and product operators Plotting these functions over their domain and range; the ‘level sets’ of multivariate functions Specific functions including: Logarithms/exponential functions, quadratic and higher-order polynomial functions, ‘min’ and ‘max’ operators Limits Geometric series Some elements of basic calculus, including, perhaps Derivatives and their interpretations As ‘slopes’ Higher-order derivatives and cross-partials, relevance for ‘minima and maxima’ (optimization) Integrals and their interpretation However, in general I’m not asking you to memorize sets of rules; I’ll give hints to remind you of these rules on any examination. ‘Total differentiation’ of a function Constrained optimization and (perhaps) the Lagrangian method (probably optional) The implicit function theorem (probably optional) and ‘comparative statics’ Some elements of Set theory, including Open and closed sets Subsets, ordered sets, unions and intersections Basic ideas of probability and expectation The logic and construction of formal definitions and proofs The logic of definitions and proofs may be the most important concept for this module Proof by contradiction Proof by construction 1.2 What is Economics? Note: DR: It has changed. There are different views. Ask two economists, and you’ll probably get at least three answers. What is Economics? Please propose a definition (from your head… give your own impression) as a comment HERE using Hypothes.is. Then unfold the box below to see some proposed definitions and ideas. “Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.” “Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” Alfred Marshall – The first quote suggests an approach (how we do our research), the second suggests a domain (what we focus on). Another famous quote: “Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.” - Ludwig von Mises What is Microeconomics? One definition, not necessarily the correct one: “The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets.”\" Largely, using theoretical and mathematical ‘models’ that depend on strong assumptions. Comprehension Q: Consider some examples of ‘relevant choices’ for economic study. Students: please propose some of these as a Hypothes.is comment HERE. For help on using hypothes.is please see ABOVE or go to https://web.hypothes.is/. What sort of models are we talking about?… To refresh your memory… you have probably seen some of these models before in your previous economics module. You should have some familiarity with the simple models of supply and demand curves yielding an equilibrium price and quantity. You may also have seen a models of trade, between two countries or two individuals, with only two goods, where for each good one has a ‘comparative advantage’. Other models involve ‘strategic’ interactions bwtween a few ‘players’. Others involve individual ‘optimizing’ choices. Still others involve firms and governments setting ‘mechanisms’ trying to induce particular choices by others. Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications. A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and ‘general’; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications. But I don’t find it satisfactory if people respond to a meaningful criticism of a model and the way it is being applied with ‘it’s just a model, and all models are abstractions.’ Specific critiques need to be dealt with directly. 1.2.1 So why learn these models, if they are not realistic? Consider the parable of the tortoise and the hare (Aesop)… Original version, English translation Merrie Melodies version One might question the realism of this story: Can hares really speak? Is this a rabbit or a hare? What other animals were racing? Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above questions? The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models. Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop’s fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of ‘Ceteris paribus’ (all other things being equal) can help us here. Again, so why learn these models? They are a starting point They (sometimes) make concrete predictions you can test They may be useful for building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking Discussion is framed around these models and they are seen as a ‘baseline’ You must understand the arguments and models to be able to effectively critique or extend them For example, some critics of what they call ‘neoliberal economics’ can be misinformed about what it is. Their criticism can sound to us mainstream economists like someone who says ‘cars are dangerous and should be banned because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping’. 1.3 Economic Models Economic model: One definition: A simple theoretical description that captures the essentials of how the economy works. For the material we cover in this module, this definition would only work if we interpret the term ‘economy’ very broadly. What is economic theory and what can it do? Unlike “theory” in some other social science disciplines, economic theory is mostly based on mathematical modelling and rigorous proof that certain conclusions or results can be derived from certain assumptions. But theory alone can say little about the real world. For example, my impression is that in Psychology a ‘theory’ can represent broad descriptions and stories summarizing and providing a framework for understanding empirical evidence. In Economic theory we can prove theorems, essentially the logic of ‘if-then’ statements… ‘if one assumes the following preferences, the following choice is optimising’, etc. However, here the realism of the assumptions is always in question; as caricatured in this Twitter meme] In Economics: Models = Theory = Uses Mathematics… for the most part. Again, ‘economic theory’ and models generally do not provide evidence about the real world, they just tell us things like if (i) people make choices exactly as specified by assumption X, (ii) their choices will be the same as if they made these according to assumption Y, (iii) and the outcomes will have the following relationship (e.g., quantity demanded sloping downward in prices), and vice-versa. But this doesn’t tell us that people do make choices as specified by assumption X. We are simply showing the mathematical equivalence of (i), (ii), and (iii). I discuss this further: - in my writing bookhere and - here 1.3.1 Differing views about models There are differing views on the meaning, purpose, and use of economic models. This discussion is rather abstract but important. These concerns and issues may make more sense as we get into considering specific models in detail. So we will try to come back to this. We will return to this in our discussions, and again when we consider the use of experiments. See the suggested readings/notes on readings. Source reading: The discussion below is largely from (Sugden 2017) “Credible worlds: the status of theoretical models in economics.” Journal of Economic Methodology 7.1 (2010): 1-31.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40267405?seq=1) Sugden’s paper mentions two famous papers, one of which is (Nobel Laureate George) Akerlof’s “the Market for Lemons” (Akerlof 1970). It would be worth reading some of Akerlof’s paper and seeing how much you can follow; it is rather accessible. We may return to this specific model of asymmetric information later in the module, and it could certainly be relevant for your project. If you are interested, I will set up a wiki to engage in a group discussion of these articles. The instrumentalist view: The Methodology of Positive Economics (Friedman 1953): the ultimate goal of theory is to “yield valid and meaningful … predictions about phenomena not yet observed”\" “Simplicity” – ‘the less initial knowledge needed to make a prediction’. “Fruitful” – more precise predictions, for a wider range of situations In contrast, the ‘Fictionalist’ view (Sugden 2017): describes a fictional world that is credible or truthlike in something like the way that the events of a realistic novel are; the model connects with the real world by relations of similarity Some considerations: Are these models predictive? If not, are they useful? There are arguments for modeling optimising behavior if it is not predictive. There is some evidence for near-optimisation in some settings, and that choices move in this direction. There is also evidence of ‘predictable irrationality’ (or ’bounded rationality); this motivates behavioural economics. There is some evidence for the following (unfold). Psychological costs/benefits relating to *outcomes other than their own final consumption. People may care about others’ consumption (altruism etc.), about the way they make the decision … and about how close they come to certain goals (see ‘reference points’ and ‘loss aversion’). People have self-control problems. They also may realize their short-term choices are not in their lt interest, and try to constrain themselves. It is mentally costly to carefully calculate the costs and benefits \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘rational inattention’ As a result, people may follow simple rules or ‘heuristics’ to make their decisions easier; e.g., ‘work every day until I’ve earned target income’. The PPF: a ‘model’ and a way of seeing things At this point we consider a simple and specific model to fix ideas, to make things less abstract. The NS text brings up the production possibility frontier; this is a common example to start with, although by itself it could be argued that ‘the insights gained are basically by assumption’ … there is not really an additional reasoning step. Perhaps a better depiction of this example is in the Curtis and Irvine open access text, sections 1.3-1.5, where they consider two individuals with distinct production possibilities, and derive the ‘aggregate’ ppf, and show the gains to trade. Figure 1.1: Production possibility frontier PPF file source LINK, User:Everlong, CC-BY-SA-3.0) Above, we see a depiction of the “production possibility frontier”. You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced. According to (Nicholson and Christoper 2007) The PPF illustrates key principles: Scarce Resources Scarcity involves opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it. On the PPF above the opportunity cost of more guns is less butter. The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone ‘next best’ opportunity from a choice. I may just call this ‘cost’ Can you think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the ‘cost’ and the economists’ definition of an ‘opportunity cost’? Opportunity costs are (often) increasing. What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases. The “law” of diminishing marginal returns.1 However I’m not sure if I would call this a ‘model’. It certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions. This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now. Consider: How wo make this a meaningful ‘model with assumptions’? I could imagine it as below (unfold). To make this more clearly a ‘model with assumptions’, let’s assume an economy with Two possible goods: food and clothing A single input into the production process for either good labour (L) The economy has a fixed supply of labour \\(\\bar{L}\\). The production function for food is \\(F_f(L)\\) and the production function for clothing is \\(F_c(L)\\), with both ‘strictly and continuously increasing in their argument’. All firms have these same production functions (this implies there are no spillovers/externalities between firms, and no complementarities between producing each good) Both production functions exhibit diminishing returns to scale (we leave off the maths for how to precisely define this for now) These assumptions in the fold above could be considered a ‘model’ of an economy. Note that not everything has been specified. E.g., we might ask: i. How many firms are there? ii. How do the firms compete in output and input markets? iii. What exactly are these production functions? There are also clearly unrealistic elements, e.g.: i. Only two goods, ii. Only one input, iii. No complementarities in production Still, the assumptions given will yield a PPF with the shape above: the ‘feasible production set’ of the economy will have a particular shape. It’s ‘maximal elements’ constitute the ‘frontier’ of this set, which will be: downward-sloping, because each unit of the input (\\(L\\)) used to produce clothing cannot be used to produce food, and concave (increasing opportunity costs), because of the diminishing returns to scale for each good … as more labour is diverted to clothing away from food, it becomes less and less relatively productive. This seems to convey an insight that 1. teaches us a way of thinking and 2. seems likely to carry over into more ‘realistic’ models. At the very least, it suggests that, under any economic system, there may be tradeoffs between how much of each good or service can be consumed. E.g., policymakers may need to consider ‘should we have more health care or more non-health consumption’, rather than simply saying ‘we should provide the best health care that money can buy to everyone.’ One might at this point raise the ‘paradox of analysis’: we have stated a set of ‘assumptions’ and then noted what logically follows. But actually, the ‘results’ and the assumptions are basically logically equivalent. So have we simply defined the answer we wanted to get, i.e., circular reasoning? This is a deeply philosophical issue. The ‘increasing opportunity costs’ insight seems more fragile, more dependent on a fairly strong assumption. How do we know that there are diminishing returns to scale for each good? There are plausible reasons why it may be the opposite… returns to specialisation as an economy, etc. Furthermore, the model at this level of simplicity cannot speak to a number of questions. E.g., without a sense of the market structure (how many firms and how do they compete), we do not know whether we will attain the PPF– the economy may end up producing at the inferior point ‘C’, for example. A ‘simpler’ model is not necessarily better, nor necessarily worse. For comprehension: Be sure you can draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means Interactive exercises (‘problem set’): Discussion and brief writing/speaking exercise on ‘what Economic models are for’, examples of models.

How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular ‘reasonable’ assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of ‘optimization’? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions? Digging deeply into the logic and justifications for these models of choice, and alternative frameworks, will be very relevant in considering Behavioral Economics (This is a specialty of Ariel Rubinstein, one of the O-R text’s two authors, and also a research interest of mine). In fact this text works behavioral economics in from the beginning. This is also relevant for building empirical models such as ‘models of consumer choices and preferences’ in ways that are relevant to (e.g.) Business-data-analytics consulting. We approach this in an abstract and logically and mathematically-rigorous, but not highly ‘computational’ way. Even if you have taken Economics as an undergraduate, you may not have seen this approach. We will not always be quite so mathematically rigorous throughout the module. However, I want to at least give you some of these tools, and a ‘flavour’ of this approach, which characterises modern Microeconomics (and will be at the core of PhD modules). 2.1 Reading Main reading (largely integrated into web book): O-R Chapters 1-2 (we will focus on selected material as described in this web book, but feel free to read these chapters in their entirety if you find it interesting; it all may be useful for your project, dissertation, and future work and study) Note: Within O-R chapter 1, feel free to skip the proof of propositions 1.1 (‘representing preferences by utility functions’) and 1.2 (‘Preference relation not represented by utility function’) Alternative treatments for some of this material (read this if you need a different approach than the ones O-R are taking)… unfold McDL: Ch 12, plus ‘preference relations’ Here is a version we can write dropbox notes in AUT: Lecture 3 - Axioms of Consumer Preference and the Theory of Choice (note, slightly different notation) NS: Ch 2 Readings: ‘real research papers’ Supplementary and conceptual readings (please read at least some of these): Sugden, Robert. “Looking for a Psychology for the Inner Rational Agent.” Social Theory and Practice 41, no. 4 (2015): 579-98..

It may seem like we have the answers, but this is only where we have asked the questions very carefully But sometimes ignorance is bliss. Examples: Sunk-cost fallacy, gains to trade/comparative advantage, opportunity cost, free-riding/prisoners’ dilemma, double-marginalization,‘raise price to raise profit’, etc. I’ve had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife. Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out. We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a ‘single representative consumer’. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights. However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or testing these models, be careful; people may differ and they may change and they may have multiple motives. 9.2 Supplement: market imperfections can suggest business opportunities A major theme in Economics is: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets \\(\\rightarrow\\) opportunities. Although we are not focusing on ‘market failure’ in this module (BEEM101, 2020)… I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse. I’m not telling you what you need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics. I also believe that these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks. Here are some possible examples. Imperfection: Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘All you can eat’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for ‘all-you-can-eat’ And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later. Free-riding on public goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) Disneyworld, resorts We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride. They then charge an admission fee to ‘be inside of Disney World’ and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods. Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Uber, AirBnb Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves). Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Tinder Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high. A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit. If you’re interested, see my research on this here, presentation slides here, my research page is here. Asymmetric information, adverse selection \\(\\rightarrow\\) NHS, ‘Obamacare’ This one is a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA. Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later). There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance (or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well. Note: Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you ‘outsource’ and when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do? Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets \\(\\rightarrow\\) opportunities. I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse. I’m not telling you what you need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics. As I also mentioned, these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks. Here are some possible examples. Imperfection: Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘All you can eat’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for ‘all-you-can-eat’ And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later. Free-riding on public goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) Disneyworld, resorts We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride. They then charge an admission fee to ‘be inside of Disney World’ and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods. Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Uber, AirBnb Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves). Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Tinder Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high. A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit. If you’re interested, see my research on this here, presentation slides here, my research page is here. Asymmetric information, adverse selection \\(\\rightarrow\\) NHS, ‘Obamacare’ This one is a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA. Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later). There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance (or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well. Note: Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you ‘outsource’ and when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do? 9.3 Supplement: is Microeconomics applicable to nature… outside of humans? Studies of honeybees have found that they generally do not gather all of the nectar in a particular flower before moving on. Why not? What key features do modern human economies have that ‘animal economies’ don’t have? Largely: trade, prices, specialisation, free choice vs instinct. The economics of trade may also apply to the natural world in certain ways. Above, we see the working of ant-aphid symbiosis, a form of mutualism. Relevant to the ‘conditions necessary for trade to occur’? The ants ‘farm’ the aphids, who secrete nice substances. In return the ants protect the aphids and only sometimes eat them.
