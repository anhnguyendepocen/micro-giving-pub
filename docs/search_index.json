This is… a Microeconomics module. We will learn and use maths and rigorous logic to consider deep questions of: Individual preferences, choices and optimization subject to constraints How individuals interact with one another, and the consequences of this (Game theory and mechanism design/agency problems) “Markets”, prices, and “welfare” (how much value is created, who gets what, how do we consider these outcomes as a society) Psychological influences on the above, and limits to optimization (Behavioral Economics) a Selective and bespoke module We will not cover ‘all of Microeconomics’. I will focus on a limited set of concepts, models and applications (and academic articles) that I hope you will find most interesting and useful. We will skip many major important topics. But that’s OK. We will learn tools, ‘modes of thinking’, and ‘modes of proving results’ that should strengthen your brain muscles and help you understand a much wider body of material. I often focus on models with ‘surprising’ or ‘counter-intuitive’ results. If you can explain the logic behind these (as well as the maths), you have achieved an understanding beyond a layman’s intuition. I will try to incorporate a small set applications that are particularly relevant to your careers and your research interests. , I may also try to incorporate data, statistics/empirical modeling, and ‘computer coding’ because these will be super-important in your career. Please give me feedback on what you are interested in. an Inquisitive module: we ask the ‘how?’, ‘why?’, ‘so what?’, and ‘is this reasonable?’ … of the models and concepts When studying Economics, I often saw models presented, with strong assumptions, without any explanation of what these were for and how they could be justified. In this module we will always be skeptical and carefully ask ‘what is the purpose’ of each model and concept. For example, ‘what does it mean to say that something is a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium?’ … Do we expect people to actually randomise in this way? Level of this module This module is adapted to students from a variety of backgrounds. For students interested in pursuing a PhD in Economics, and interested in research: We will cover some approaches and relevant building blocks, and I will point you to relevant materials for further enrichment I will incorporate content from academic literature (‘articles in peer reviewed journals’) and sophisticated research considerations I will incorporate my own research, research methods, and ‘really getting our hands dirty’ in digging into research questions, building theoretical (maths) models, and even perhaps experiments, coding, and data analysis. We will discuss your proposed research, relate microeconomic theory and models to this, and bring this into coursework I will try to help you ‘think, research and write’ like a good economist. (See my Writing and research guide here. However, please note that will not fully prepare you for doctoral study and academic research that requires advanced Microeconomics. MRes programmes and modules are better geared to this. For students coming from backgrounds with limited Economics training and limited abstract maths: I will explain most concepts ‘from the ground up’, or point you to what you will need to revise. I will present most material also at an intermediate level, using diagrams and simple intuition. But note that you need to have SOME background in Economics to do well in this module. This is an MSc-level Economics module, after all. For students who are not as fluent in English as they would like to be (perhaps many/most of our students): I will try to communicate clearly and at a reasonable pace, avoiding slang and using diagrams and maths to convey ideas Most of what I say in lectures/videos/tutorials is also in writing here in this web book (or in links) I will strongly encourage you to participate actively and try to help you improve your English communication skills. Interacting with my Writing and research guide here should also be helpful for this (and for your dissertation, if you will be writing one). Readings and resources This module will use a variety of resources: I will guide you through this via the online text that you are reading now.. Consider this the ‘governing resource’. This draws heavily from several texts and other resources, all of which are free and available online. I will make it clear what come from where, and where you can find additional readings. In particular: “O-R”: Models in Microeconomic Theory, by Osborne and Rubinstein Our main aim is to give the reader an understanding of the concepts of model and equilibrium in microeconomic theory This book is very precise, abstract (in a mathematical sense), and extremely well-written and full of wisdom and insight. It is dense; don ’t worry if it takes you a long time to digest each concept (but if you get stuck, please do ask questions and try different approaches). It is the most relevant (at least of these three) for further postgraduate/PhD study. The authors claim ‘the mathematics we use is elementary’. However, I think it contains a deep sort of maths that you will find challenging. As they say, ‘many of the proofs involve sustained logical arguments’. Introduction to Economic Analysis version 2.1 by McAfee, Lewis, and Dale This is a more traditional text, with more ‘computational-style’ problems. It covers a wider set of Economics concepts than the others. “QMC”: Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus by Yoram Baumann, the self-proclaimed ‘World’s First Standup Economist’ This is somewhat less rigorous than O-R, but it has its own strengths. It approaches the material in an unusual way, and covers some material that is non traditionally covered in Economics courses (and skips many core concepts). As I am incorporating some material directly from these works, I include the licences below (in the fold). Osborne and Rubinstein: creative CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 I could not find the license information for the McAfee et al text. Baumann (QMC): Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 We also make use of academic articles and working papers as well as some of my own writings… these are mentioned below Other relevant resources Simpler resources (unfold if interested) Varian, Hal R., Intermediate microeconomics: a modern approach. New York, NY: WW Norton &amp; Company, 2010: Somewhat less formal than O-R but it also covers a wider set of material and computations. Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder. We have used this for a good chunk of this module in past years. It is at a very basic level, in terms of the maths. Free online access to this text may be available through your university/library (this works at Exeter) via www.vlebooks.com A free alternative, at a similar level: Microeconomics an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine Microeconomics by Hugh Gravelle and Ray Rees (version 3, widely available online for free): A somewhat more advanced-intermediate-level text which I think you will find very useful; this is not yet officially Open-Source, but you can find it online for free (and the authors are OK with this, I have emailed them). Just do a web search for ‘Gravelle and Rees Microeconomics’ and you will find the pdf More rigorous, advanced and applied work will draw from David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here)[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/] this will give you a flavor of the PhD level micro (License information in the fold) David Autor. 14.03 Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy.

About this web-book: the Governing Resource Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics I wrote this web-book to outline all of the material you are responsible for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short amount contact time that we have. I don’t mean you’re simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that these notes will aim to refer to everything that you are responsible for. This web-book is meant to be a complement to the texts and readings (and to the lectures/videos, tutorials/problem sets and other material on the ELE) and to tie all of this together. I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in this web-book. However, things may adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to this as we go along. I will keep you informed of any changes via the ELE (VLE) forums and the ELE page in general. Web-book versus slides?: (unfold) At times I will present material using slides. This web-book should include all of the slide material plus explanatory notes and enrichment material. (However, I left out some of the jokes.) I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will also make the slides themselves available even though they are redundant– this web-book has everything that slides have. ‘Markers’, abbreviations, and callouts/boxes OR: Osborne and Rubinstein’s [Models in Microeconomic Theory]((https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/1171) ‘McDL’ refers to the McAfee, Dale and Lewis text ‘QMC’ refers to ‘Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus’ (Baumann) ‘DA’ refers to David Autor’s MIT open courseware notes for Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy ‘Comprehension Q:’ A question you should be able to answer if you are following along. Margin notes: (Look on the right… \\(\\rightarrow\\)) These reflect brief comments, hints, side points, or reference links. Folding boxes: I will occasionally put additional material in boxes that can be unfolded. Sometimes I do this with “question and answer” so you’ve an opportunity to consider the answer before peeking. I also will do this with some material that involves a side conversation, or material that is very tangential, and would otherwise clutter up the text. Look in the fold: Greetings from the fold! The weather is nice in here. I will use these boxes for ‘notes’ expressing material that is important, but is somewhat ‘aside’ from the main content. This color of box is used for ‘hints and tips’. Boxes like this indicate ‘warnings’ … usually highlighting ways that students often misunderstand particular content. Leaving comments and asking questions within this book using Hypothes.is As you read this book, you can put comments/question right in the text, see and respond to other’s questions/comments (these should be highlighted in yellow and) see my answers and responses (I will periodically check this), leave comments and answer specific questions asked in the text, offering me valuable feedback. You can do this using a browser tool called hypothes.is (you can go to their site to learn more about this tool). Sign up for a hypothes.is account (this takes 2 minutes and it’s free). It will be better if you get an account that identifies you to me, so I can follow up with individual feedback and learn more about who you are. However, it’s also fine if you want to make your account ID basically anonymous… or you could even get two accounts, if you prefer. You don’t need to install anything. However, if you install the Hypothes.is plugin for your browser this will give you the additional ability to leave comments on other sites and start private groups. To add a comment or question After you’ve an account (and you are signed in), to add a comment or ask a question here, just: Highlight some text Figure 0.1: highlighting text Click the ‘annotate’ icon that comes up Write your comment or question Write your question in the box (see icons to use math notation and other features) Please add the tag ‘beem101’ to help others search for this. Click ‘post to public’ I will periodically browse and respond. To view existing comments/questions from yourself and others You should see these highlighted in yellow if you are signed in (I think), as well as with little markers with the number ‘1’ on that sidebar If you click the ‘eyeball’ on the side you can turn this off and on If you click the ‘paper’ on the sidebar, you can open up and see the existing notes (and respond to them) Sometimes, in this web-book I will specifically ask you to give answers, suggestions, and feedback on specific questions I will write something in a box like the one below Please let me know how Hypothesis is working for you by leaving a Hypothes.is comment HERE. This means I really want you to put a comment exactly at that point in the web-book, and I’ll be watching for these. Some more cool things about this book Look at the icons that should appear on the top of the page: These allow you to: Hide/show the outline bar Search the full text for a word Change the font style, color, and size Show keyboard shortcuts Figure 0.2: For example, you can choose nighttime serif font Tech details of this book (‘do I call this ’collophon’?) I created this in Rmd (the ‘R languages’ ‘markdown’), including some latex and html code too, with features adapted from the ‘Tufte’ package. This is all put together by Knitr and Bookdown using the ‘Pandoc’ conversion tool into an Html file which I’m hosting via Github pages for now. For details on how this works, I have a guide (to how I work in a similarly constructed ‘bookdown’) HERE.

Respond to the discussion questions and get feedback. Learn from the ‘ground up’: You cannot ‘skip’ learning steps. If you do not understand the concept behind the concept being explained, go back and learn it. Care about the content: Care about actually understanding this stuff. This will be rewarded. Don’t try to game this. It’s easier and better to just learn this stuff. Try to achieve Real Understanding: Be able to explain this stuff in your own words (in writing) and apply it to new situations Interact and discuss: Peers, Forum, office hours (see above) Be careful you know how to interpret the midterm exam instructions correctly, as well as the instructions for the project. Use your time wisely. For the project: start writing and outlining as you begin and as you progress – don’t wait to write things down. Be in contact with me (and your fellow students) to continually discuss how this is going. Skills to hone and build. Your success in this module will depend in large part on building and applying maths skills and tools, as well as strong reading/writing/logic and communication abilities. You should build the ability to comprehend and respond carefully and logically to nuanced questions, in careful writing, orally, in maths, and in diagrams. Be able to incorporate quantitative reasoning, logic, and the ability to understand and clearly express ideas, to correctly characterise and describe theories and evidence, and to apply learned principles to new situations. تحذير, 警报, ескерту, การเตือ, चेतावनीน Suggestion 5 above is especially relevant for non-native speakers of English.

Although we are not focusing on ‘market failure’ in this module (BEEM101, 2020), there are some interesting examples I often discuss, of how these can lead to business opportunities. See this supplement… and let me know your thoughts.

Preferences and choices under (probablistic) uncertainty (building blocks for finance!) How do we value ‘a bundle of possibilities’ against another bundle … and how do we choose among these? Insurance, investments, life choices (university, job), consumer choices ‘Risk aversion’ and the returns to risk (Monopoly) firms: product offerings, pricing and segmentation How do they max (LR) profits in light of consumer choices? What are the implications of this for society? How can they ‘do segmentation’ to boost profits? What do they actually do? (Using data?) Strategic interaction and game theory E.g., ‘which side of the street to walk on?’, ‘how much to charge/produce if there is a competing firm?’, ‘should I ask my partner to marry me?’, ‘how much should a political campaign invest in advertising in a particular state/county?’ Is there an advantage or disadvantage to ‘being the first to make an offer’ in bargaining? When should I wear a mask? What should we predict about ‘who wears a mask’ and what should increase or decrease this? ‘Other-regarding’ preferences (BE) may enter here! Throughout, but with supplements at the end: Behavioural economics Applications and evidence from the real world and the ‘laboratory’ Research and research skills (reading/writing, mathematical modeling, critical thinking, considering applications to the real world and to data, research integrity) Note: contrast from previous years (unfold) The ‘story of this module’ (in the video and fold above) is modified from how I structured it in prior years. In contrast to the approach I’m taking now, Microeconomics is often taught in terms of: ‘building blocks of the market’ on the consumer and producer side putting this together to consider the market in ‘general equilibrium’ under perfect competition, and the welfare consequences of this market failures and departures from perfect competition. This year (in this web book) I’m taking a different path. We are focusing instead on the meaning, tools, and structure of decision-making and on how to consider and apply models. I will put a strong emphasis on uncertainty, strategic interaction, and behavioral economics/psychology. There is less focus on welfare, market equilibrium, or the model of production. Planned syllabus, coverage (detailed) The planned module outline is below. All timings are approximate and may need to be adjusted. Some material may be cut for time constraints. Feel free to skip over the first time you read these notes; you may want to refer to this later. The relevant part of this outline will be repeated at the beginning of each section within this book. After I add the material to that section, I may remove it from this outline. Overview of module &amp; rules, discussion/background, Economic models (&amp; maths tools), ‘empirical’ evidence (\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) week) This content will take roughly half a week to cover, but we will return to it later. Coverage and notes: below (on the present page) Models, meaning, metrics, maths revision Interactive exercises (‘problem set’) Sec. 2: Preferences and utility; Choice (1.5 weeks) What can we reasonably say about ‘what people prefer and choose’? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular ‘reasonable’ assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of ‘optimization’? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions? Note on mathematical precision (unfold) This precision is relevant for Behavioral Economics (a specialty of Ariel Rubinstein and an interest of mine). The text involves behavioral economics throughout. … also relevant for building empirical ‘models of consumer choices and preferences’ in business/consulting settings. We approach this in an abstract and logically and mathematically-rigorous, but not highly ‘computational’ way. Even if you have taken Economics as an undergraduate, you may not have seen this approach. We will not always be quite so mathematically rigorous throughout the module. However, I want to give you a ‘flavour’ of this approach and, and the tools at the core of modern microeconomics (and the approach taught in PhD programmes). Readings: see sec. 2.2 Interactive exercises (‘problem set’) Sec. 3 Preferences under uncertainty (and over time) (1 week) Here we follow the order of O-R in covering preferences under uncertainty before consumer behavior and demand. ‘Expected Utility’ Risk-aversion, finance and diversification time-preference and discounting (briefly) With uncertainty (outcomes are unknown when choices are made, but we assume the probabilities of outcomes are known), again … What can we reasonably say about ‘what people prefer and choose’? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular ‘reasonable’ assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of ‘optimization’? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions? Applications (esp. to finance): How do we express and measure ‘risk aversion’? How does this affect (financial, investment, insurance) choices? Why does ‘diversification improve outcomes for the risk-averse’? How does this affect asset prices (Stocks, bonds, etc.) with ‘efficient markets’ (this will be briefly defined) Behavioral Economics: the “Allais Paradox” (first treatment, time-permitting) Brief (first) presentation: Preferences (and optimization over) assets and consumption over time; ‘discounting’ Main Readings: Web book, and also… O-R Chapter 3: “Preferences under Uncertainty” Feel free to skip the following (unfold) Feel free to SKIP: … the proof of propositions 3.2 (‘Continuity and independence implies EU’). It’s interesting but we can’t cover everything. If you don’t understand the proof of prop. 3.3. (the equivalence of risk aversion and the concavity of the Bernoulli function) that’s also OK.

These are important for characterizing the welfare effects of price changes and policy changes (including taxation), and for conceptualizing issues involving multiple constraints on consumer optimization (e.g., rationing). I will provide notes on these for anyone who is interested. We are also skipping most of the ‘production side’ (skipped material in fold) Production functions, firm optimisation Perfect competition/competitive equilibrium; short and long run Supply and demand systems General equilibrium and it’s welfare properties Market failures, including externalities/public goods (although these come back as examples in our Game Theory discussion) We this skip these chapters in the text(s). So skip O-R chapter 6 and skip any material on this in the other texts. (Or read it if you want to; you might find it useful in getting an overall picture, but it’s up to you.) To the extent that these are relevant to material we cover later, I will give you the ‘short version’ when it comes up. ‘Monopolies and pricing of profit-maximizing price-setting firms’ (especially monopolies); price discrimination/market segmentation (1.5 weeks) How would a firm that knows all the stuff above about consumer demand set prices in order to maximise its profit? What if it can segment its customers into different ‘markets’ with distinct demand functions? What are the consequences of all of this for profit and welfare? Today’s businesses, consultants, data analysts, and regulators are extremely interested in these questions. This is a very practical topic. We will consider it both from the theoretical optimization point view (while always gaining insights from the maths). We will also dig into “what do firms actually do in setting pricing” and “how can data be used to do this better?” Main reading O-R ch. 7 “Monopoly” We will focus on the (standard) profit-maximisation goal, although their discussion of other goals is interesting. They define consumer and producer surplus here to give a brief treatment of the deadweight loss of monopoly. They also have a very interesting treatment of the two main types of price discrimination; ‘Implicit discrimination’ foreshadows asymmetric information and agency problems. There are various names of each of these … I am familiar with “second degree = self-selection” and “third degree or ‘explicit segmentation’”. They call the latter ’Implicit discrimination. Alternative treatments (unfold): McDL: Ch 15 – Monopoly NS: 11.2-11.4 QMC: Appendix A.1 - Monopoly - the vanilla version Supplementary recommended readings (unfold): Article: Should we help companies tailor prices to your wage packet?

OR question 5-7 Possible exercise involving data and ‘choosing a firm’s best price and segmentation’ Notes: Mid-term examination, and a major “skip” We will have a mid-term examination at this point in the module. This examination will cover all of the material up to this point, but it will be more heavily-focused on the earlier material. Note that here we are largely skipping ‘imperfect competition’ and interactions between firms. We may come back to this briefly in our ‘game theory’ examples. Strategic interactions: Game theory (and evidence) (1.5 weeks) The outcomes we care about don’t only depend on what we choose, but on what others’ choose (and perhaps we can also influence the latter). How should we think about choices and outcomes in such settings? What will we predict will happen in single or repeated interactions, and what will affect these outcomes? Strategic interactions Stating the game in ‘normal’ form Dominance, iterated dominance, Rationalisability Best response functions, Nash equilibrium in pure and mixed strategies (if time is tight we may skip mixed strategies) Extensive-form games; sequential and repeated games Backwards induction and Subgame Perfection (subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium) Infinitely or indefinitely repeated games Games of imperfect information Behavioral economics: transforming material payoffs into true payoffs Evidence on play in strategic situations, including in ‘experiments’ Time-permitting: Research applications to ‘Marriage markets and Tinder’, ‘Fair trade and consumer altruism’ Here the web-book is a key resource. We will incorporate material from: O-R Chapters 15-16 Skip sections 15.5 (Strictly competitive games), and 15.6 (Kantian equilibrium) In chapter 16, we may or may not skip the formal depiction of extensive/sequential games; this depends on our timing In addition to (some) of the Game Theory material covered in O-R: We will also focus on ‘Dominant strategies’, and ‘Iterated-strict-dominance’. Compared to ‘Nash equilibria’, these are (IMHO) more justifiable as predictors of choices especially in one-shot games.

For this project you will construct, evaluate and discuss one or more mathematical models dealing with a specific applied or theoretical economics research question. (I will also consider an empirical project if you can strongly connect it to the material taught in this module.) Ideally, this will be related to the work you intend to pursue for your MSc dissertation. You will be required to present and discuss this work in a short live session. This project can be an individual project or done in a group of 2-3 people. If it is done as a group, each student will also be asked to present a single page outlining their own contribution to the project, and each will be required to present the work to me individually. Further details and parameters will be given. In the final half week, we will discuss this project.

We will return to the issues of ‘what and why models’ throughout the module. 1.1 Empirics, maths revision Some of the maths you need will also be simultaneously covered in your Optimisation and Econometric modules, sometimes at a higher level. We will use some maths in this module, and now would be a good time to revise some of this on your own. Here are some key elements. We will consider the use of microeconomics in ‘empirical identification’ of effects using data. The mixtape, Scott Cunningham pp 18-22, provides a good introduction to this So called ‘pre-calculus’ and general maths concepts including The symbolic language and notation of maths, summation and product operators Multivariate and univariate functions (and mappings), inverses of functions, implicit functions Plotting these functions over their domain and range; the ‘level sets’ of multivariate functions Specific functions including: Logarithms/exponential functions, quadratic and higher-order polynomial functions, ‘min’ and ‘max’ operators Limits, Geometric series Some elements of basic calculus, including, perhaps However, in general I’m not asking you to memorize sets of rules; I’ll give hints to remind you of these rules on any examination.

Optional: I may also occasionally use matrix and vector notation, and combine this with calculus (see concepts such as the ‘gradient’ and ‘Hessian matrix’). However, these will be provided as supplements; you shouldn’t consider these to be required. 1.2 What is Economics? Note: DR: It has changed. There are different views. Ask two economists, and you’ll probably get at least three answers. What is Economics? Please propose a definition (from your head… give your own impression) as a comment HERE using Hypothes.is. Then unfold the box below to see some proposed definitions and ideas. For help on using hypothes.is please see ABOVE or go to https://web.hypothes.is/. “Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.” “Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” Alfred Marshall – The first quote suggests an approach (how we do our research), the second suggests a domain (what we focus on). Another famous quote: “Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.” - Ludwig von Mises What is Microeconomics? One definition, not necessarily the correct one: “The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets.” Largely, using theoretical and mathematical ‘models’ that depend on strong assumptions. Comprehension Q: Consider some examples of ‘relevant choices’ for economic study. Students: please propose some of these as a Hypothes.is comment HERE. What sort of models are we talking about?… To refresh your memory… you have probably seen some of these models before in your previous economics module. You should have some familiarity with the simple models of supply and demand curves yielding an equilibrium price and quantity. You may also have seen a models of trade, between two countries or two individuals, with only two goods, where for each good one has a ‘comparative advantage’. Other models involve ‘strategic’ interactions bwtween a few ‘players’. Others involve individual ‘optimizing’ choices. Still others involve firms and governments setting ‘mechanisms’ trying to induce particular choices by others. Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications. A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and ‘general’; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications. But I don’t find it satisfactory if people respond to a meaningful criticism of a model and the way it is being applied with ‘it’s just a model, and all models are abstractions.’ Specific critiques need to be dealt with directly. 1.2.1 So why learn these models, if they are not realistic? Consider the parable of the tortoise and the hare (Aesop)… Original version, English translation Merrie Melodies version One might question the realism of this story: Can hares really speak? Is this a rabbit or a hare? What other animals were racing? Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above questions? The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models. Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop’s fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of ‘Ceteris paribus’ (all other things being equal) can help us here. Again, so why learn these models? They are a starting point They (sometimes) make concrete predictions you can test They may be useful for building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking Discussion is framed around these models and they are seen as a ‘baseline’ You must understand the arguments and models to be able to effectively critique or extend them For example, some critics of what they call ‘neoliberal economics’ can be misinformed about what it is. Their criticism can sound to us mainstream economists like someone who says ‘cars are dangerous and should be banned because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping’. 1.3 Economic Models Economic model: One definition: A simple theoretical description that captures the essentials of how the economy works. For the material we cover in this module, this definition would only work if we interpret the term ‘economy’ very broadly. What is economic theory and what can it do? Unlike “theory” in some other social science disciplines, economic theory is mostly based on mathematical modelling and rigorous proof that certain conclusions or results can be derived from certain assumptions. But theory alone can say little about the real world. For example, my impression is that in Psychology a ‘theory’ can represent broad descriptions and stories summarizing and providing a framework for understanding empirical evidence. In Economic theory we can prove theorems, essentially the logic of ‘if-then’ statements… ‘if one assumes the following preferences, the following choice is optimising’, etc. However, here the realism of the assumptions is always in question; as caricatured in this Twitter meme] In Economics: Models = Theory = Uses Mathematics… for the most part. Again, ‘economic theory’ and models generally do not provide evidence about the real world, they just tell us things like if (i) people make choices exactly as specified by assumption X, (ii) their choices will be the same as if they made these according to assumption Y, (iii) and the outcomes will have the following relationship (e.g., quantity demanded sloping downward in prices), and vice-versa. But this doesn’t tell us that people do make choices as specified by assumption X. We are simply showing the mathematical equivalence of (i), (ii), and (iii). I discuss this further: - in my writing bookhere and - here 1.3.1 Differing views about models There are differing views on the meaning, purpose, and use of economic models. This discussion is rather abstract but important. These concerns and issues may make more sense as we get into considering specific models in detail. So we will try to come back to this. We will return to this in our discussions, and again when we consider the use of experiments. See the suggested readings/notes on readings. Source reading: The discussion below is largely from (Sugden 2017) “Credible worlds: the status of theoretical models in economics.” Journal of Economic Methodology (2010) Sugden’s paper mentions two famous papers, one of which is (Nobel Laureate George) Akerlof’s “the Market for Lemons” (Akerlof 1970). It would be worth reading some of Akerlof’s paper and seeing how much you can follow; it is rather accessible. We may return to this specific model of asymmetric information later in the module, and it could certainly be relevant for your project. If you are interested, I will set up a wiki to engage in a group discussion of these articles. The instrumentalist view: The Methodology of Positive Economics (Friedman 1953): the ultimate goal of theory is to “yield valid and meaningful … predictions about phenomena not yet observed”\" “Simplicity” – ‘the less initial knowledge needed to make a prediction’. “Fruitful” – more precise predictions, for a wider range of situations In contrast, the ‘Fictionalist’ view (Sugden 2017): describes a fictional world that is credible or truthlike in something like the way that the events of a realistic novel are; the model connects with the real world by relations of similarity Some considerations: Are these models predictive? If not, are they useful? There are arguments for modeling optimising behavior if it is not predictive. There is some evidence for near-optimisation in some settings, and that choices move in this direction. There is also evidence of ‘predictable irrationality’ (or ’bounded rationality); this motivates behavioural economics. There is some evidence for the following (unfold). Psychological costs/benefits relating to *outcomes other than their own final consumption. People may care about others’ consumption (altruism etc.), about the way they make the decision … and about how close they come to certain goals (see ‘reference points’ and ‘loss aversion’). People have self-control problems. They also may realize their short-term choices are not in their lt interest, and try to constrain themselves. It is mentally costly to carefully calculate the costs and benefits \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘rational inattention’ As a result, people may follow simple rules or ‘heuristics’ to make their decisions easier; e.g., ‘work every day until I’ve earned target income’. 1.3.2 The PPF: a ‘model’ and a way of seeing things At this point we consider a simple and specific model to fix ideas, to make things less abstract. The NS text brings up the production possibility frontier; this is a common example to start with, although by itself it could be argued that ‘the insights gained are basically by assumption’ … there is not really an additional reasoning step. Perhaps a better depiction of this example is in the Curtis and Irvine open access text, sections 1.3-1.5, where they consider two individuals with distinct production possibilities, and derive the ‘aggregate’ ppf, and show the gains to trade. Figure 1.1: Production possibility frontier PPF file source LINK, User:Everlong, CC-BY-SA-3.0) Above, we see a depiction of the “production possibility frontier”. You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced. According to (Nicholson and Christoper 2007) The PPF illustrates key principles: Scarce Resources Scarcity involves opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it. On the PPF above the opportunity cost of more guns is less butter. The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone ‘next best’ opportunity from a choice. I may just call this ‘cost’ Can you think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the ‘cost’ and the economists’ definition of an ‘opportunity cost’? Opportunity costs are (often) increasing. What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases. The “law” of diminishing marginal returns. I’m somewhat sceptical of this being a ‘law’; there are certainly increasing returns in certain regions. However, you will see it again and again as it is a fairly standard assumption. However I’m not sure if I would call this a ‘model’. It certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions. This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now. Consider: How could we make this a meaningful ‘model with assumptions’? I could imagine it as below (unfold). To make this more clearly a ‘model with assumptions’, let’s assume an economy with Two possible goods: food and clothing A single input into the production process for either good labour (L) The economy has a fixed supply of labour \\(\\bar{L}\\). The production function for food is \\(F_f(L)\\) and the production function for clothing is \\(F_c(L)\\), with both ‘strictly and continuously increasing in their argument’. All firms have these same production functions (this implies there are no spillovers/externalities between firms, and no complementarities between producing each good) Both production functions exhibit diminishing returns to scale (we leave off the maths for how to precisely define this for now) These assumptions in the fold above could be considered a ‘model’ of an economy. Note that not everything has been specified. E.g., we might ask: i. How many firms are there? ii. How do the firms compete in output and input markets? iii. What exactly are these production functions? There are also clearly unrealistic elements, e.g.: i. Only two goods, ii. Only one input, iii. No complementarities in production Still, the assumptions given will yield a PPF with the shape above: the ‘feasible production set’ of the economy will have a particular shape. It’s ‘maximal elements’ constitute the ‘frontier’ of this set, which will be: downward-sloping, because each unit of the input (\\(L\\)) used to produce clothing cannot be used to produce food, and concave (increasing opportunity costs), because of the diminishing returns to scale for each good … as more labour is diverted to clothing away from food, it becomes less and less relatively productive. This seems to convey an insight that 1. teaches us a way of thinking and 2. seems likely to carry over into more ‘realistic’ models. At the very least, it suggests that, under any economic system, there may be tradeoffs between how much of each good or service can be consumed. E.g., policymakers may need to consider ‘should we have more health care or more non-health consumption’, rather than simply saying ‘we should provide the best health care that money can buy to everyone.’ One might at this point raise the ‘paradox of analysis’: we have stated a set of ‘assumptions’ and then noted what logically follows. But actually, the ‘results’ and the assumptions are basically logically equivalent. So have we simply defined the answer we wanted to get, i.e., circular reasoning? This is a deeply philosophical issue. The ‘increasing opportunity costs’ insight seems more fragile, more dependent on a fairly strong assumption. How do we know that there are diminishing returns to scale for each good? There are plausible reasons why it may be the opposite… returns to specialisation as an economy, etc. Furthermore, the model at this level of simplicity cannot speak to a number of questions. E.g., without a sense of the market structure (how many firms and how do they compete), we do not know whether we will attain the PPF– the economy may end up producing at the inferior point ‘C’, for example. A ‘simpler’ model is not necessarily better, nor necessarily worse. For comprehension: Be sure you can draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means 1.3.3 “Supply and demand functions”, the “Marshallian cross”, “equilibrium effects” Perhaps the most famous model from micro-economics is what is often called ‘supply and demand’, the ‘Marshallian cross’. I try to avoid the terms ‘supply’ or ‘demand’ because it confuses whether we are referring to: Supply curves and demand curves (or functions) or Quantities exchanged (in equilibrium quantity demanded will equal quantity supplied in each market. Is this helpful in explaining the real world? Does it make better predictions than other approaches might do in terms of… (for example)? The impact of taxes on prices and quantities exchanged? The response of oil prices to events like the Coronavirus pandemic? Whether a tradesperson would find it profitable to increase his or her price when she seems to be getting more orders than she can handle? Of course the simple model predicts that she should raise her prices in this situation… so there should never be a ‘shortage’ unless prices are restrained. However, when I tried to hire a plumber in Exeter in 2017 I was repeatedly told ‘everyone is too busy’, not ‘rates are very high these days’. What could explain this? 1.3.4 Models applied in the context of “returns to university education” We may ask a question something like: Is it worth the cost and time for the typical US high-school student to enroll in university (‘college’)? In the US private university tuitions run at over £40,000 per year (for a four-year course!) There is constant popular (and academic) discussion of this. See some links below the fold. Please stop asking whether college is worth it Is your university degree barely worth the paper it’s written on? Discuss The case against education, Bryan Caplan; LSE review Note: the above are popular accounts, not academic Economic peer-reviewed publications. For some fairly recent academic references, see (e.g.) (Carneiro 2011), papers cited wihin this, and papers citing it. Link to paper Consider: How would you frame the above question, as an economist, in terms of things that can be defined and measured? What does the answer to the question depends on, from an economics perspective? This involves microeconomic concepts such as (unfold) Returns to labour inputs in (competitive?) markets; human capital The role of skilled labor in the production function Asymmetric information over employee ‘type’ and ‘signaling’ Intertemporal substitution of consumption and ‘discount rates’ Even framing the question requires microeconomics. Consider: Social vs private returns. Is there a case for ‘market failure’ in the provision of education? How would you measure this empirically? (some thoughts in the fold) Empirical ‘identification’ is very difficult. Suppose you simply compared the incomes of those who did and didn’t go to university. These is a well known ‘endogeneity’ or ‘omitted variable bias’ problem here. It seems reasonable to think: “…compared to those who did not go to university, those who went to university would have tended to earn more (and perhaps to be more socially productive) even if they had not gone to university.” So how can we identify the actual effect of university on their outcomes. We have a set of other approaches that arguably allow us to answer this ‘causal question’… see further discussions on ‘causal inference’, causal econometrics, and in ‘empirical labor economics’. These approaches generally involve either: Very careful ‘control strategies’ to try to compare observably similar people who did or did not attend university or Something approximately equivalent to a ‘natural experiment’ (‘instrumental variables’, lottery assignments, ‘regression discontinuities’, etc.) 1.3.5 How to evaluate, asses, and test models? Unsurprisingly, there are a variety of opinions as to how to asses the value of a model. Some considerations include their ‘elegance’ (which is a bit vague), their ‘insightfulness’, ‘how many predictions are generated from the fewest assumptions’, the ‘simplicity’ of the model, and other somewhat-difficult to asses concerns. As models are simplifications, it is not always clear what it would mean to ‘test their validity’ in terms of the real world. We might consider two broad approaches: Testing Assumptions: Examining the validity of assumptions upon which models are based. (Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.?) Testing Predictions of the models: Can the model accurately predict real-world events (in the context which it purports to?) If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid. DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general. Note: The undergraduate textbook (Nicholson and Christoper 2007) is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions. However, there are many cases in which the predictions of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms. On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as ‘constant relative risk aversion’ or ‘geometric discounting’ can be very credibly tested. We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure ‘how close’ behavior is to the assumption. There is also substantial debate over what it means, and whether/when it is valuable to ‘test an Economic model in the laboratory’. See the discussion by Sugden and Sitzia, 2011; “Implementing theoretical models in the laboratory, and what this can and cannot achieve.” 1.4 Aside: Empirical work/econometrics I want you to have a sense of what this is, and how it connects to economic theory. This is relevant background for the present module, and extremely important for your later research/dissertation work (and it may give some perspective for other modules like Econometrics). I give a supplement on this which I highly recommend reading in supplement 9.4 ‘Empirical research’.

How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular ‘reasonable’ assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of ‘optimization’? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions? Digging deeply into the logic and justifications for these models of choice, and alternative frameworks, will be very relevant in considering Behavioral Economics (This is a specialty of Ariel Rubinstein, one of the O-R text’s two authors, and also a research interest of mine). In fact this text works behavioral economics in from the beginning. This is also relevant for building empirical models such as ‘models of consumer choices and preferences’ in ways that are relevant to (e.g.) Business-data-analytics consulting. We approach this in an abstract and logically and mathematically-rigorous, but not highly ‘computational’ way. Even if you have taken Economics as an undergraduate, you may not have seen this approach. We will not always be quite so mathematically rigorous throughout the module. However, I want to at least give you some of these tools, and a ‘flavour’ of this approach, which characterises modern Microeconomics (and will be at the core of PhD modules). 2.1 Key goals of this chunk Understand ways preferences are formally modeled.

This section considers preferences separately from choices. Later, we will consider choices as potentially being made according to one’s preferences subject to one’s constraints. However, behavioral economics also considers the possibility (and ways in which) individual might make choices that in fact to not optimise, even given their own preferences. 2.3.1 Preamble We now consider the very very fundamental building blocks behind the (in)famous ‘neoclassical economics model.’ If you accept these ‘axioms’ nearly everything flows from it!

Next, suppose I asked you: ‘State a rule that governs how people do make decisions’… I want this rule to be both Informative (it rules out at least some sets of choices) and Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule). Now suppose I asked an apparently similar question: ‘State a rule that governs how people should make decisions’.. By ‘should’ I mean that they will not regret having made decisions in this way. If people did follow these rules, what would this imply and predict? Economists (and decision theorists/decision scientists) have specifically defined such rules in terms of ‘axioms about preferences’ They have started from these ‘reasonable axioms’ and followed their logical implications for individual choices, individual responses to changes in prices and income, market prices and quantities and their responses, ‘welfare’ and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc. The ‘Standard axioms’ (imply that) choices can be expressed by ‘individuals maximising utility functions subject to their budget constraints’. This yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc. We will get to this. We want to develop a model that can be used to show how we make choices or decisions. In the (neo) classical economics framework, your (optimising) choices are determined by two things: Preferences: what goods do you like? Constraints: how much money do you have, what are the prices of the goods you buy? Some more thoughts on ‘why are we learning this strange stuff?’ (unfold) For the classical Economics model, the work on preferences seems (to me) mainly as largely a matter of ‘finding a consistent justification for our models of utility and choice’. If you already find these models plausible, perhaps this is not so interesting. However, I see these details as particular relevant for a few reasons and in a few contexts. When we take a step back and look outside the classical model to consider: 1. Group and ‘social preferences’ including preferences over abstract quantities and contexts that nonetheless have real impact on decisions. For example, ‘effective altruists’ and social planners need to consider whether to support charities and policies that may ‘bring more happy people into existence’ against others that do more to ‘improve the happiness of existing people’. The philosophical issue of “population ethics” (see., e.g., (???), and the discussion in this podcast) delves deeply into how preferences can be reasonably defined. … and millions of dollars in donations are potentially at stake. 2. ‘Behavioral economics’ models that consider choices (and perhaps preferences) that are inconsistent in certain ways, and potential affected by ‘frames’. 3. Empirical approaches to modeling choices, including some models such as ‘tree-models’, which may not be easily connected to the standard ‘utility-maximizing’ approach. Also, this formality sharpens your mind, and makes you better at logical argumentation in your research work, and perhaps also in things like computer programming 2.3.3 Preferences: Notation, definition, explanation O-R give some background We follow the approach almost all economic theory and characterize an individual by her preferences among the alternatives, without considering the origin of these preferences. And unlike many other texts, O-R explain that they are doing this, and, in the examples, give some indication of why this is relevant. What sort of ‘preferences’ are we considering? Just ‘ordinal’ ones, at least for now: When we express preferences, we make statements like “I prefer a to b”, “I like a much better than b”, … In this book [as is standard] the model of preferences captures only statements of the first type… [the ranking] We can think of an individual’s preferences over a set of alternatives as encoding the answers to a questionnaire. For every pair \\((x, y)\\) of alternatives in the set, the questionnaire asks the individual which of the following three statements fits best his attitude to the alternatives. I prefer x to y. I prefer y to x. I regard x and y as equally desirable. These will later be formally encoded as \\(x \\succ y\\), \\(y \\succ x\\) (or \\(x \\prec y\\)), and \\(x \\sim y\\), or equivalently, \\(y \\sim x\\) (formally: because ‘equivalence operators are reflexive’), … respectively. However, as O-R show, these can all in fact be denoted with the careful use of a single ‘at least as good’ operator. O-R next discuss ‘binary relations’ and their properties. A binary relation on a set \\(X\\) specifies, for each ordered pair \\((x , y )\\) of members of X , whether or not x relates to y in a certain way. This is getting abstract, and unless you’ve taken some ‘pure maths’ you may be a bit confused and overwhelmed here. In this case, I will try to help you: the folded content below is a question and answer on this with a student. Beware that this is a digression, so if you already know this stuff, you can skip it. Q (from student whom I will call ‘Sue’): Not sure the meaning of ‘binary relation’. Does it refer to relationships between two objects? A: Yes, this is a pure maths concept.8 Think of a ‘binary relation’ as a computer program that does the following… You enter two objects (say ‘peanut butter’ and ‘jelly’) It tells you ‘yes, these objects are related’ or ‘no, they are not related’. For example, we can apply the binary relationship ‘\\(R_s\\): objects go well together in a sandwich’ to the above… ‘Peanut butter’ \\(R_s\\) ‘Jelly’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) true ‘Peanut butter’ \\(R_s\\) ‘tuna fish’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) false Another binary relation could be ‘\\(R_l\\): ’the first object is usually larger than the second one.’ Here we would have: ‘Whale’ \\(R_s\\) ‘Minnow’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) true ‘Minnow’ \\(R_s\\) ‘Whale’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) false Sue: Thank you! These examples are great!! I think they would be great to put in the web-book if you are planning to create one. For example, “acquaintance” is a binary relation on a set of people. For some pairs \\((x , y )\\) of people, the statement “x is acquainted with y” is true, and for some pairs it is false. (The English word ‘acquaintance’ basically means ‘has met’ or ‘knows’). Continuing with these questions and answers … (unfold) Q: What does the ‘acquaintance’ example mean? A: To give more specific examples, we could have, for \\(R_a\\): ‘is aquainted with’: Sue \\(R_a\\) “Sue’s lecturer in the UK” \\(\\rightarrow\\) true Sue \\(R_a\\) “Sue’s mother” \\(\\rightarrow\\) true “Sue’s mother” \\(R_a\\) “Sue” \\(\\rightarrow\\) true (note it is ‘reflexive’) “Sue’s mother” \\(R_a\\) “Sue’s lecturer in the UK” \\(\\rightarrow\\) false (so it’s not ‘transitive’) Sue: I was not sure what ’aquaintance meant in this example. Now I do understand! Another example of a binary relation (unfold Q&amp;A)… Another example of a binary relation is “smaller than” on the set of numbers. For some pairs \\((x,y )\\) of numbers, x is smaller than y , and for some it is not. For a binary relation R, the expression \\(x R y\\) means that x is related to y according to R. For any pair \\((x, y)\\) of members of X , the statement \\(x R y\\) either holds or does not hold. For example, for the binary relation &lt; on the set of numbers, we have \\(3 &lt; 5\\), but not \\(7&lt;1\\). Q: Given that R stands for relation, what does \\(xRy\\) means? Does it mean the relationship between x and y? A: It means ‘x relates to y, by the relation R’. If the relation R is ‘greater than’, then \\(xRy\\) means ’x is greater than y$. Q: If so, what does yRx mean? A: It means ‘y relates to x’ …. with the above example it means ‘y is greater than x’. Sue: Aha!! I see. O-R begin with the formal definition of ‘at least as desirable as’ (or ‘seen as at least as good as’). In other words, “x is at least as desirable as y” is denoted \\(x \\succsim y\\) if the individual’s answer to the question regarding x and y is either “I prefer x to y” or “I regard x and y as equally desirable”. O-R show, that in fact, all of the preference relationships can be denoted with the careful use of the \\(\\succsim\\) operator. For example: ‘Indifference’: \\[x \\sim y \\text{ if both } x \\succsim y \\text{ and } y \\succsim x\\] and ‘Strict preference’ \\[x \\succ y \\text{ if } x \\succsim y \\text{ but not } y \\succsim x\\]. Why? In pure maths, and perhaps in economic theory, they value stating a concept with the fewest and most ‘primal’ definitions possible. Technical note: This can help in proving properties of these objects and systems. By characterising something as the simplest mathematical object possible, we can apply all of the properties of that mathematical object that have been proven over the centuries. Exercise: to be sure you understand these things, close your book/computer and try to reconstruct the construction of strict preferences or indifference from only the \\(\\succsim\\) operator. Can you give the intuition for this, explaining it clearly? Consider the ‘Venn diagram’ of preferences over x and y from the O-R text (O-R, page 5, fig. 1.1) Note: Osborne and Rubinstein have requested that we not reprint any figures directly from their book. Note that the set of preferences where ‘x and y are equally desirable’ is included in both the set ‘x is at least as desirable as y’ and the set ‘y is at least as desirable as x’. 2.3.4 Properties of preferences (some standard assumptions; aka ‘axioms’) We consider some standard assumptions over preferences that, combined with some other assumptions, will be sufficient to justify using a ’utility function. Later, we will also consider the ‘More is Better’ (‘nonsatiation’ or ‘monotonicity’) type of assumptions. We skip the standard ‘continuity’ assumption here, although we return to a version of it when we consider uncertainty. Another common ‘axiom’ involves ‘diminishing marginal rates of substitution’ or, in multiple dimensions, ‘strict quasi-concavity’, something you may come across in your maths/optimization module. In general, axioms like these also stand directly behind ‘revealed preference’ methods for measuring how much people value nonmarket goods, like clean air and national parks. Completeness Completeness (informal definition): “Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive.” The following is forbidden: “I cannot choose between a ski holiday and a beach holiday, yet I am not indifferent between these.” \"Why wouldn’t I be able to express a preference? (Consider this for a moment, and then unfold…) In the case above it seems strange to not be able to express a preference. But for other cases it may be extremely difficult or painful to compare two things. Imagine if you were asked to compare ‘between ’never seeing your mother’ or ‘never seeing your father.’ In general, economists’ standard approach assumes we have a consistent preference ranking over all possibilities, and choose accordingly. However, other social sciences see this differently. Aside: Also ‘forbidden’ in the classical model: the time or frame in which I make the decisions must not affect my preferences (or choices). This will be relaxed when we discuss behavioral economics. Definition: Completeness (From O-R) The property that for all alternatives \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) , distinct or not, either \\(x \\succsim y\\) or \\(y \\succsim x\\) (or both]. Even more formally (optional)… Definition (O-R): Complete binary relation A binary relation \\(R\\) on the set \\(X\\) is complete if for all members \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) of \\(X\\), either \\(x R y\\) or \\(y R x\\) (or both). A complete binary relation is, in particular, reflexive: for every \\(x \\in X\\) we have \\(x R x\\). In case you are confused, please unfold the Q &amp;A below… Q: I am still confused with the concept of ‘reflexivity’ after reading these paragraphs. Does it mean all ‘x’ are the same A: Not exactly, reflexivity is a property (a characteristic) of the relation \\(R\\) (where this ‘relation’ could be ‘greater than’, ‘smaller than’, ‘equal’, ‘having the same number of elements’, ‘preferred to’, etc.), not the property of a ‘mathematial object’ itself. Reflexivity holds where an object always “relates to itself”. For example, in standard maths the relationship ’greater than or equal to (\\(\\geq\\)) is reflexive, while the relationship \\(\\gt\\) is not reflexive. For any number \\(x\\) the statement \\(x \\geq x\\) is true (e.g., \\(10 \\geq 10\\) is true because \\(10=10\\)). However, the statement \\(x&gt;x\\) is false … obviously a number cannot be greater than itself! (Only the Red Queen can exceed her own greatness.) Sue: Hmmmm, why is \\(10 \\geq 10\\) true??? How could 10 possibly be greater than 10? Shouldn’t the only correct statement be 10 = 10? DR: Because this is the ‘greater than or equal to’ sign. Of course ‘10 is greater than or equal to 10’ because they are equal. Just as in computer programming, with an ‘OR’ operator the condition evaluates as true if either (or both) of the conditions are true. Sue: Ooook, I think I understand it now. It makes sense to me when you linked it with computer programming; but what is the point of the \\(\\succsim\\) sign? Couldn’t the authors only use the \\(\\geq\\) sign? DR: This is in fact a notation from set theory. We are expressing preferences over objects which may not be representable by a single number. Sue: … But then why ‘completeness’ automatically ensures the second property ‘reflexivity’? DR: The authors are saying that the first property of the binary relationship, ‘completeness’ automatically ensures the second property ‘reflexivity’. Equivalently (contrapositive statement) “a relationship that is not reflexive can not be complete.” But they have only stated that this is the case. They have not PROVEN it. We would have to look up a proof or try to construct it ourselves. They don’t give the proof of this in the main text. Transitivity For a binary relation \\(\\succ\\) to correspond to a preference relation, we require not only that it be complete, but also that it be consistent in the sense that if \\(x \\succsim y\\) and \\(y \\succsim z\\) then \\(x \\succsim z\\). This property is called transitivity. (O-R) Intuitively: Transitive preferences are ‘internally consistent’: If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C. Formally definition of ‘transitive binary relation’ (optional) Definition: Transitive binary relation [O-R] A binary relation R on the set \\(X\\) is transitive if for any members \\(x\\) , \\(y\\) , and \\(z\\) of \\(X\\) for which \\(x R y\\) and \\(y R z\\), we have \\(x R z\\). Let’s explore this more simply in terms of strict preferences, the \\(\\succ\\) symbol. Transitivity means: \\[ A \\succ B \\: and \\: B \\succ C \\rightarrow A \\succ C \\] If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer an Apple to a Cherry. A similar idea holds if I am indifferent between one pair of these. (\\(\\sim\\)) … this obviously extends to ‘chains’ combining these … so \\[ A \\succ B \\:\\: and \\: \\: B \\sim C \\rightarrow A \\succ C \\] etc. We may write this concisely as \\(A \\succ B \\sim C\\). If this seems confusing it may be because it is too obvious (although behavioral and experimental economists claim to find violations of this. If you found someone who striclty preferred an apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them!. Consider: How would you do this? (Unfold below for a description). It works as follows (being a bit informal here): Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry. Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of banana (or ‘money’). Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra. Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra. … Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you’ve drained them of all of their resources. Violations of transitive preferences? (Unfold) Violations of transitivity? see… Loomes, Graham, Chris Starmer, and Robert Sugden. “Observing violations of transitivity by experimental methods.” Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society (1991): 425-439. Choi, Syngjoo, et al. “Who is (more) rational?.” The American Economic Review 104.6 (2014): 1518-1550. We will return to this after we consider choice. Feel free to skip the O-R discussion of symmetric and anti-symmetric relations, and also skip the discussion of symmetric/antisymmetric relations, if you want. It is fun, but it is barely used later in the text. 2.3.5 Possible preferences .. “Preference formation” We might derive preference relations from a few “basic considerations”, perhaps reflecting how people describe their own preferences (and choices) in conversation. These can be considered in terms of individual preferences, or, as we will see later, ways to express group-preferences or social preferences. We will consider a few examples, some of which do satisfy completeness and transitivity, and some of which do not satisfy one or both of these. Value functions O-R first consider a ‘value function’ “\\(v\\) that attaches to each alternative a number” … the preference relation here \"is defined by \\(x \\succsim y\\) if and only if \\(v(x) \\succsim v(y)\\). This is close to the ‘utility function’ that we will discuss later. It is trivial to show that this is complete and transitive. (Can you show it?). Do you know what ‘if and only if’ means? This is important. (If you don’t know, unfold below.) “If and only if” is sometimes depicted as \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) (and abbreviated ‘iff’). When we say “statement A holds if and only statement B holds”, we mean that whenever statement B holds statement A must hold, and also, whenever statement A holds statement B must hold. This also implies that if statement A does not hold, statement B cannot hold and vice versa. Another way of saying this is “statement A is a necessary and sufficient condition for statement B.” For example, in simple algebra we can assert (and prove): \\(x &gt; y\\) if and only if \\(2x &gt; 2y\\), i.e., \\(x &gt; y \\leftrightarrow 2x &gt; 2y\\), To prove the ‘if and only if’ relationship, you need to prove both directions of this relationship. For this example, I would need to show both: \\(x &gt; y \\rightarrow 2x &gt; 2y\\) and \\(2x &gt; 2y \\rightarrow x &gt; y\\). If you are struggling with this, you may find the Khan academy Logic material helpful, as well as more advanced treatments of hte logic of mathematical proofs. Distance functions Figure 2.2: American Gothic, by Grant Wood Maybe you have heard someone say something like: I know what I like; there is a perfect life for me. I simply want everything to look as close to this as possible. O-R: “One alternative is “ideal” for the individual; how much he likes every other alternative is determined by the distance of that alternative from the ideal, as given by a function \\(d\\). \" This might be expressed as the preference relation \\(\\succsim\\) defined by \\[x \\succsim y \\: \\leftrightarrow \\: d(x) \\leq d(y)\\] We will return to “distance functions” later. We are all familiar with the ‘Euclidean distance’ function… which happens to represent the actual straight-line distance between two physical objects in three dimensional space. However, there is no obvious single measure of the “distances between two bundles of goods and services, with many measurable attributes.” This issue also comes up in analysis of real considering (e.g.) consumer preferences over different products a firm could manufacture. Note that the above is, in fact a value function, with the ‘value of alternative x’ expressed as \\(v(x)=-d(x)\\). Lexicographic (‘lex’) preferences Remember the Blue Cat in the video? … When he considered his preferences over the teas, he said: I care first and foremost about whether the tea box is rectangular. If several boxes are equally rectangular, then I care about which box is the most white. If the boxes are equally white, then I care about which box is biggest. This seems to be an example of what we call ‘lexicographic preferences’. Why are lexicographic preferences important? (Think and unfold:) Ask people how they make their choices, particularly when they are shopping online. I bet that some people will describe a process of ‘ruling out’ one set of options after another. This is, in fact an optimal procedure for someone with lex preferences. This is not for someone with the more standard preferences you may have seen in economics courses, someone who considers trade-offs between one attribute and another. The ‘filtering’ is also consistent with the standard way data is organised. Try to search for a product or service online (on Amazon, or Kayak): it is hard to specify your trade off between different characteristics, but it’s easy to ‘narrow things down’ one category at a time. In business data science, some ‘tree-based’ models of choice implicitly assume lex preferences. Business marketers speak of ‘hygiene factors’; if these are not achieved, the customer will walk away. As stated by O-R: An individual has in mind two [or more] complete and transitive binary relations, \\(\\succsim_1\\) and \\(\\succsim_2\\), each of which relates to one feature of the alternatives. For example, if \\(X\\) is a set of computers, the features might be the size of the memory and the resolution of the screen. (O-R, p. 7) Lexicographic preferences can be applied to any number of features, but we will only consider two features here. The individual gives priority to the first feature, breaking ties by the second feature. (O-R, p. 7) Formally, [for lexicographic preferences] the individual’s preference relation \\(\\succsim\\) is defined by \\(x \\succsim y\\) if: \\(x \\succ_1 y\\) or \\(x \\sim_1 y\\) and \\(x \\succsim_2 y\\) . From now on, I may use the abbreviation ‘lex preferences’ to mean ’lexicographic preferences. Are lexicographic (lex) preferences complete? Consider how you might show whether they are or are not complete, and then unfold the box below. Its completeness follows from the completeness of \\(\\succsim_1\\) and \\(\\succsim_2\\). (O-R, p. 7) If we suppose that the ‘sub-preference orderings’ \\(succsim_1\\) and \\(succsim_2\\) can be applied to these features of any alternative… then we can apply the procedure above to determine the overall preference ordering \\(\\succsim\\) between any two pairings. Are lex preferences transitive? Suppose that \\(x \\succsim y\\) and \\(y \\succsim z\\). To show transitivity by our definition, we now need to show that this neccesarily implies that \\(x \\succsim z\\) holds. Also note that the above example happens to be perfectly general (we sometimes state this as ‘without loss of generality’ or ‘WLOG’). As we have complete preferences, for any three options, it must be that you can choose labels for them x, y, and z, such that \\(x \\succsim y\\) and \\(y \\succsim z\\). There are two possible cases: Note that these are the only two possible cases. (We know this because case 2 is simply the ‘negation’ of case 1. In standard logic either something is true, or it is not true). Thus if we can prove transitivity for both case 1 and case 2, we have proved it ‘for all possible cases’. Case 1: “The first feature is decisive when comparing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\): \\(x \\succ_1 y\\).” Case 2: “The first feature is not decisive when comparing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)…” Considering Case 1: Given, by the above assumption, that \\(y \\succsim z\\), it must be that \\(y \\succsim_1 z\\) … i.e., y is “at least as good as z in its first feature” – otherwise, according to our preferences, y could not be ‘at least as good as z’). so by the transitivity of \\(\\succsim_1\\) [which was part of the definition of lex preferences]… we obtain … \\(x \\succ_1 z\\) and thus \\(x \\succsim z\\) Wait, why does \\(x \\succ_1 y\\) combined with \\(y \\succsim_1 z\\) imply that \\(x \\succ_1 z\\)? (think, and then unfold). This seems intuitively obvious: if ‘x is strictly better than y’ and ‘y is at least as good as z’, then it should be that ‘x is strictly better than z’. But if we are compulsive mathematicians, we would need to actually formally prove this, as Problem 1b requests. … And why does \\(x \\succ_1 z\\) imply that \\(x \\succsim z\\)? (think, and then unfold) By condition (i) in the definition of lex preferences, if \\(x \\succ_1 y\\) then \\(x \\succsim y\\). (Obviously, as this is a general definition, it also applies if we swap z for y in this statement.) …\"but wait, why aren’t you stating \\(x \\succsim z\\) (‘x is at least as good as z’)… don’t we know that \\(x \\succ z\\), (‘x is strictly preferred to z’)? (unfold) Three responses: For this case, \\(x \\succ z\\) does not come directly out of the definition of lex preferences. (I think this could be derived, but we do not need to.) Our definition of transitivity involves the \\(\\succsim\\) operator, and not the \\(\\succ\\) operator; we need to prove it precisely as defined. Anyways, \\(x \\succ y\\) implies \\(x \\succsim y\\) (but not vice versa). \\(\\succsim\\) is the ‘weaker’ condition. So if \\(x \\succ y\\) is a true statement then \\(x \\succsim y\\) is as well (always). Wait we are not done! We only proved this for one case; now we must consider the ‘negation’ of this case: Considering Case 2… : \"The first feature is not decisive when comparing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\): \\(x \\sim_1 y\\) …(and \\(x \\succsim_2 y\\) must hold as we assumed that \\(x \\succsim y\\) overall.) Case 2 is further broken down into two comprehensive sub-cases, which I will call 2a and 2b. Given that the first feature is not decisive for comparing x and y… …then either the first feature is decisive when comparing y and z (‘case 2a’), or it is not (‘case 2b’). Either… 2a: \\(y \\succ_1 z\\) … then … “we obtain \\(x \\succ_1 z\\) and therefore \\(x \\succsim z\\).” O-R write that this follows “from the transitivity of \\(\\succ_1\\)”. I believe that here they mean we know that if \\(A \\sim B\\) and \\(B \\succ C\\) then \\(A \\succ C\\) by the property of these logical relations \\(\\sim\\) and \\(\\succ\\). Thus we must have that \\(x \\sim_1 y\\) and \\(y \\succ_1 z\\) implies \\(z \\succ_1 z\\) or 2b: \\(y \\sim_1 z\\) implying that \\(y \\succ_2 z\\) for y to be preferred to z overall, as assumed. By the transitivity of \\(\\sim_1\\) we obtain \\(x \\sim_1 z\\) … (recalling \\(x \\sim_1 y\\) is what defined case 2)… and by the transitivity of \\(\\succsim_2\\) we obtain \\(x \\succsim_2 z\\). Thus \\(x \\succsim z\\). Thus we have shown, for all possible cases that, or lexicographic preferences \\(\\succsim\\) as defined above, \\(x \\succsim y\\) and \\(y \\succsim z\\), implying that these preferences are transitive. We can now write quo erat demonstrandum or ‘Q.E.D’, meaning ‘what was to be demonstrated’ [has been demonstrated]. This is sometimes expressed with the symbol \\[\\blacksquare\\]. Why did we do this?? Gee, this took a long time. Was it a fun puzzle or a tedious chore? Why did I show you this? (Unfold the box below for my thoughts on this. I think it is good for you to get a sense of what mathematical/theoretical economics proofs look like. It’s good for improving the rigorous structure of your arguments in general. It may be helpful for future reading. It helps you be sure that you understand the concepts defined. Also, we learned a few concepts here in doing this. I would suggest that we learned things like… A proof can constructed by demonstrating that something must hold for all possible cases. We can do it by dividing up the space of all possible cases and showing it for each part of this space. The idea of “weaker and stronger conditions” (strict vs weak preference) How to use ‘general properties of mathematical objects’ (like the transitivity of the \\(\\succsim\\) operator) to construct proofs for specific cases. Mathematical and logical arguments often contain many simple steps, perhaps too many to keep in your head all at the same time. That’s why it’s important to write things down and not try to do everything in ‘spoken form.’ However, as this is so time-consuming, and not always insightful, I won’t drag you through all the proofs… only dip in occassionally. Unanimity rule The individual has in mind \\(n\\) considerations, represented by the complete and transitive binary relations \\(\\succsim_1, \\succsim_2,..., \\succsim_n\\). For example, a parent may take in account the preferences of her \\(n\\) children. In the movie (and book) “Sophie’s choice” a mother is asked to make a horrible choice very disturbing clip here. This may be a case in which we think preferences are not ‘complete’; we cannot express preferences among our children’s lives. Or, getting back to our basic idea, an individual may simply have preferences over \\(n\\) characteristics of an outcome (or a product, or a bundle of products) Define the binary relation \\(\\succsim\\) by \\(x \\succsim y\\) if \\(x \\succsim_i y\\) for \\(i = 1,...,n\\). In other words, this may be is a person who says something like: I only prefer a holiday in Jamaica to a holiday in France if Jamaica is better than France in all attributes (or vice-versa). Otherwise I can’t say anything about it. Or a group policy-maker who says (unfold): Group PM: “I can only state that we prefer the Conservatives’ policy is better than the Liberals’ if it is better for everyone in our society (or vice-versa). Otherwise, we don’t have a group preference.” In fact, these precise definitions of preferences, and their characteristics, are useful in considering the idea of ‘public choice’ and social welfare functions. We may derive things like ‘impossibility theorems’ that tell us the limits of what group-decision-making can accomplish. O-R discuss this in chapter 20, ‘Aggregating preferences’, but we probably won’t have time to cover it directly in this module. Difficult choices: “We have to think about the rest of the family.” (Warning: the above video may be offensive to some people.) What properties does the ‘Unanimity rule’ preference relation have or not have? (Unfold) This binary relation is transitive but not necessarily complete. Specifically, if two of the relations \\(\\succsim_i\\) disagree (\\(x \\succsim_j y\\) and \\(y \\succsim_k x\\), then \\(\\succsim\\) is not complete. How do we know it’s transitive? (unfold next section) Informally ’If X is at least as good as Y in all aspects, and Y is at least as good Z in all aspects, then X is at least as good as Z in all aspects, How does the example in the prior fold show that it’s not complete? (unfold below) If ‘two of the relations disagree’ when comparing any two elements in the choice set (x and y), then the condition ‘x is at least as good as y in all aspects’ does not hold, nor does ‘y is at least as good as x in all aspects’ hold. So the unanimity preference relation ‘rule’ does not state that either is preferred. Maybe this is obvious when you think in the group context: If we can only make a decision if everyone agrees that one option is better than the other, there will be cases where we cannot say either way which is preferred. The ‘unanimity rule’-based preferences are not complete, which suggests this has limited use as a decision rule (when we get to actual ‘choice’). ‘Majority rule’ (read about this in O-R) solves this problem but brings another problem, which leads to the ‘Condorcet paradox’, also known as the ‘voting paradox’. After reading this in O-R, unfold below for an example of how this makes it difficult to clearly express ‘public choice’ through majority voting. Voting paradox example Suppose we are trying to choose, as a society, between three options in our choice set \\(X\\): a Green Park, Public Housing, or Private Housing. Suppose we have a local council with one member from each party (representing equal-sized constituencies). Preferences of these groups are as follows (considering strict preferences; as O-R state, the preferences here are ‘anti-symmetric’): Green party: Green Park \\(\\succ\\) Public housing \\(\\succ\\) Private housing Labour: Public housing \\(\\succ\\) Private Housing \\(\\succ\\) Green Park Conservatives: Private Housing \\(\\succ\\) Green Park \\(\\succ\\) Public housing Suppose we have a local council with one member of each party (representing equal-sized constituencies). Which proposal would win if they voted on: - a Green park versus Public housing? - a Green Park versus Private housing? - Private housing versus Public housing? Try each vote and see who wins. Does a majority vote reveal a clear ‘consistent social preference’? No, not here. Are preferences transitive in the real world? In the O-R questionnaire they asked people to make 36 choices between pairs of alternatives taken from a set of 9 alternatives. Each alternative is a description of a vacation package with four parameters: the city, hotel quality, food quality, and price. They varied the ordering of the description of these features. You might want to do that survey now if you haven’t done it yet, to understand what we are talking about. e.g., one choice could be between “A weekend in Paris, with 4 star hotel, food quality 17, for 574 USD” versus “A weekend in Berlin, with 5 star hotel, food quality 15, for 500 USD” They found that 85% of the roughly 1300 showed at least one ‘intransitivity’, where their stated preferences implied “A is preferred to B”, “B is preferred to C”, and “C is preferred to A” for some combination of three alternatives. Or they simply reversed themselves, stating ‘A is preferred to B’ in one case and ‘B is preferred to A’ in another case. That is also a violation of transitivity, of course. They also note that the order in which the features of the package are listed has an effect on the expressed preferences. This is something we call a ‘framing effect’; the way an option is stated affects people’s choices (or stated preferences). This is a major discussion in behavioral economics. Framing effects include things like ‘anchoring’, ‘halo effects’, ‘decoy effects’, etc. (Look up what some of these mean if you are interesting). Framing effects might be interpreted as a violation of the idea of ‘transitive preferences’. On the other hand, one might argue instead that ‘the frame is itself a characteristic of the product.’ Do the results of the O-R survey demonstrate that ‘people frequently exhibit intransitive preferences’? Consider why this may or may not be considered definitive evidence (and then unfold below for some suggestions.) This may be suggestive evidence, but I don’t think it should be considered definitive. One possible objection… These were ‘hypothetical’ questions; no one was actually making real choices here. In contrast, Economics research usually emphasizes real ‘incentivised’ choices, either in lab or field experiments or relying on ‘observational’ data. Thinking about these choices carefully is mentally costly. Respondents may not have put in the time to carefully consider these choices. 2.4 Utility functions Recall, a ‘value function’ simply assigns a real number to each alternative. A Utility function is simply a value function which ‘represents preferences’. Utility function (O-R definition) For any set \\(X\\) and preference relation \\(\\succsim\\) on \\(X\\), the function \\(u : X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) represents \\(\\succsim\\) if \\[x \\succsim y \\text{ if and only if } u(x) \\geq u(y)\\] We say that \\(u\\) is ’a utility function for \\(\\succsim\\). \\(u : X \\rightarrow R\\) means that the function \\(u\\) takes any element in the set \\(X\\) (perhaps each element is a combination of goods, services, and leisure time) and returns a real number. To make this concrete… Can you construct a utility function that ‘represents’ preferences $a b c d on the set {a,b,c,d} (Unfold) One such utility function (O-R page 9) \\(u(a)=5\\), \\(u(b)=u(c)=-1\\), \\(u(d)=-17\\). Of course many other utility functions also represent these preferences. 2.4.0.1 Aside: ‘what is utility’ and what does it mean? There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature Although the NS text describes it as “The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity” I think that most economists do not see it that way. Perhaps the modern non-behavioral definition of utility would be ‘the thing that drives choices, subject to constraints’. So if utility is (at best) defined as ‘the thing that people maximise’, does it have any meaning, or does it simply lead to circular reasoning. What do you think? (My thoughts in the fold). My opinion is that there is some ‘bite’. A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated, thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, ‘utility’, which is maximised. Other social sciences often reject this. Also note that behavioral economics often separates preferences from choices, as in the O-R text, and some models even separate ‘choice-utility’ from ‘realized utility.’ In general, we don’t imagine that we can somehow measure an individual’s actual ‘amount’ of utility. To the extent that we can measure it at all, it is only inferred indirectly, from the choices people make. See D. Colander ‘Edgeworth’s Hedonimeter and the Quest to Measure Utility’’ Journal of Economic Perspectives, Spring 2007: 215-225 for a discussion of the history of this idea. This raises another issue: can we compare whether one person gets ‘more’ or ‘less’ utility than another? Can we know whether a policy can “increase one person’s utility more than it decreases another person’s utility”? These issues are considered in modeling social welfare and social choices. In more detailed discussions, we might speak of ‘cardinal utility’, ‘ordinal utility’. Empirically, it is hard to imagine how these could be measured: if utility is only indirectly and partially observable through an individual’s choices… when do we observe choices that trade off between one person and another in ways that reflect the ‘sum of their utilities’? (Never, I guess.) 2.4.1 When can utility functions ‘represent preferences’? The rest of this section in O-R is highly abstract and I don’t see many direct applications to practice. You can skip much of it, but please do cover the parts mentioned below. Here O-R give a fancy definition of ‘maximal element with respect to \\(\\succsim\\)’ … basically, the ‘best or (at least tied-for-best) element in the set, considering these preferences.’ Similarly for the ‘minimal’ element. O-R Lemma 1.1 … in any ‘nonempty finite set’ there must be at least one mimal and at least one maximal element. This is pretty obvious and intuitive. Still, it is worth reading over the proof of this as it gives you an easy example of ‘proof by induction’. The logic of ‘proof by induction’… (to prove that something holds for a set of any countable size \\(N\\)): Show statement X holds for the first element (here, for \\(n=1\\)) Show that ‘if X holds for any element \\(n-1\\) it must also hold for element \\(n\\)’ Putting 1 and 2 together, you now know that statement X must always hold (for any countable finite set of some size \\(N\\)). ‘Just start with the first element and count up to N’. Aside: is there a ‘smallest interesting integer number’? Can you prove why or why not? No, there cannot be, I can ‘prove it’. Suppose there that \\(K\\) were the ‘smallest interesting integer’. But then integer \\(K-1\\) would be the ‘largest non-interesting number.’ That fact alone should make it interesting! Therefore, there cannot be any smallest interesting integer! (I think this passes for a joke in the maths community.) The following proposition, and other propositions extending this, are fundamental to the idea that we can conduct our economic analysis as if people actually consulted a utility function. x Proposition (O-R 1.1): Every preference relation on a finite set can be represented by a utility function. Note that this requires a finite set; this must involve a countable number of elements to choose among. It is not guaranteed (at least not without further conditions) for a preference relation on an infinite set. For example, the set of elements ‘any real number between 0 and 10’ is an infinite set. You may skip the proof of this proposition, if you like. Examples: lexicographic preferences on a finite set Lexicographic preference on a finite set (like the set of seats in a movie theatre) can be represented by a utility function, Following O-R example 1.2: Suppose an individual prefers to sit as far back as possible (in the highest numbered ‘row’). This is her first priority. Within any ‘row’ she prefers to sit as far to the left as possible (in the highest numbered ‘column’) Please view figure 1.3 from O-R (page 12). Osborne and Rubinstein have requested that we not reprint any figures directly from their book. Consider, how could you assign a utility function to these preferences? Just rank the seat preferences, and assign the lowest utility number to the least-preferred seat (most front and right). Then increase the utility by 1 as you move each seet to the left. Then start at the next row back, all the way to the right, adding 1 to the utility, etc. O-R give another (equivalent) utility function for this, noting that, for this example there are 40 rows of seats and 50 columns (50 seats per row). \\[u(x)=50 r(x) - c(x) + 1\\] where \\(r(x)\\) is the row number and \\(c(x)\\) the column number. (I’m not sure why they added the ‘+1’, there is no need for a utility number to be positive.) Allowing for infinite sets: some (but not all) preferences can be represented by a utility function There are ‘important’ economic theorems specifying ‘sufficient conditions for preferences to be represented by a utility fncn’ ; we will not cover it, but unfold below for some more discussion, if you are interested. ‘Continuous preferences’ as well as completeness and transitivity \\(\\rightarrow\\) a utility representation; these are jointly sufficient conditions. Continuous preferences will also ensure continuous utility functions and allow us to discuss concepts such as ‘marginal utility’ and ensure and gradually sloping demand curves. Note that everywhere-differentiable utility functions are continuous. Howevee, the ‘lexicographic’ preferences are not continuous. What is continuity? One definition: Continuity: If \\(A \\succ B\\) and \\(C\\) ’lies within an \\(\\epsilon\\) radius of \\(B\\) then \\(A \\succ C\\). Notice this does not hold for lex preferences. For example, consider the infinite set \\(\\mathbb{R}^+\\), the set of all non-negative real numbers. This is a reasonable choice set to consider, perhaps, in some contexts. E.g., ‘I may be able to consume any zero or positive amount of food’ ( note we have not yet brought in constraints, we are just considering preferences). Suppose ‘I always find more food at least as good as less food’. We could represent this preference as \\(x \\succsim y\\) if and only if \\(x \\geq y\\) This is easily represented bu the utility function \\(u(x)=x\\). … or in fact, by any utility function which is an increasing function, such as $u(x)= x^2 + ln(x) + 108 In contrast, consider lex preferences on an infinite set, the ‘unit square\", where the first priority is the first coordinate and the second priority is the second coordinate. This is like the ’movie theatre’ example, except instead of specific seats, one can locate at any exact point in the square. See O-R page 13, figure 1.4, for a depiction of lex. preferences withinin a square. so that, for example, \\((0.3,0.1) \\succsim (0.2,0.9) \\succsim (0.2,0.8))\\) O-R show and then ‘prove’ (alluding to a more general proof), that: Notation: The ‘{}’ enclose the definition of the set. “\\((x_1,x_2)\\)” means we are talking about sets of pairs of elements. The colon (“:”) is read as ‘such that’. “\\(x_1,x_2 \\in [0,1]\\)” means that each of these elements must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to 1. The brackets (“[]”) specify a ‘closed set’ including these boundaries. The (lexicographic) preference relation \\(\\succsim\\) on \\(\\{(x_1,x_2) : x_1,x_2 \\in [0,1]\\}\\) …. defined by \\((x_1,x_2) \\succ (y1, y2)\\) if and only if either (i) \\(x_1 &gt; y_1\\) or (ii) \\(x_1 = y_1\\) and \\(x_2 &gt; y_2\\) is not represented by any utility functiom You may find it more worthwhile to ‘try and fail’ to give a utility function depicting such preferences. Of course, no matter how many times you fail, you have not proved that it is ‘impossible’. But it may help you gain intuition. You can skip the proof that follows this. 2.4.2 An increasing function of a (‘regular’*) utility function represents the same preferences O-R say ‘Increasing function of utility function is utility function’. But it’s more than this. It’s the same utility function. * Note that I say ‘regular utility function’. When we consider uncertainty in the ‘expected utility’ framework, this will not hold with respect to ‘increasing transformations’ of the functions we will be dealing with, only with respect to ‘affine (linear) transformations’. This is pretty important because it gives us a sense of how closely we might be able to identify a utility function. As O-R note: if the function \\(u(x,y)\\) represents a given preference relation then so does the function \\(3u(x,y) −7\\) [for example] This means that even if we knew a persons’ preferences, we wouldn’t know whether the utility function was “actually” \\(U(Apples, Bananas) = A + B^2\\) or \\(U(Apples, Bananas) = 4(A + B^2)^3 + 37\\) etc. These utility functions express the same preferences. In general: The notation here is a bit loose perhaps? When we say \\(x \\in X\\) we are considering elements \\(x\\) that may have multiple components… \\(x\\) may be a bundle of goods and services, etc., so \\(u(x)\\) may be a function of several variables. O-R Proposition 1.3: Let \\(f : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) be an increasing function. If \\(u\\) represents the preference relation \\(\\succsim\\) on \\(X\\) , then so does the function \\(w\\) defined by \\(w(x) = f(u(x))\\) for all \\(x \\in X\\). The proof is pretty quick and reasonable: \\(w(x) \\geq w (y)\\) means is the same thing as saying \\(f(u(x)) \\geq f(u(y))\\), by the above definition. Because \\(f\\) is an increasing function (*), \\(f(u(x)) \\geq f(u(y))\\) holds if and only if \\(u(x) \\geq u(y)\\). \\(u(x) \\geq u(y)\\) which is true if and only if \\(x \\succsim y\\), by the definition of utility functions ‘representing preferences.’ An increasing function is simply a function that increases in its arguments. By definition, \\(f\\) is an increasing function if and only if \\(f(a)&gt;f(b)\\) whenever \\(a&gt;b\\). At this point, you may want to work through the exercises on preferences and utility. (But not the exercises on choice just yet.) 2.5 Choice Note that this follows much of O-R chapter 2. You must read that chapter along with these notes. All quotes are from O-R unless otherwise noted. 2.5.1 Choice and rational choice Recall … a preference relation refers only to the individual’s mental attitude, not to the choices she may make. In this chapter, we describe a concept of choice, independently of preferences. (O-R, p. 17) The separation of Preferences and Choice in their text, into separate concepts and chapters, is a bit unusual. I suspect that this reflects how these are often separated in Behavioral Economics; unlike in classical economics choices might not simply optimise with respect to an individual’s preferences (and ‘experienced’ utility). Choice problems, choice functions Given a set \\(X\\), a choice problem for \\(X\\) is a nonempty subset of \\(X\\) and a choice function for \\(X\\) associates with every choice problem \\(A \\in X\\) a single member of \\(A\\) (the member chosen). (O-R, def 2.1) This is ‘dense’. In more plain English, a ‘choice problem’ is a subset of alternatives (perhaps those alternatives which are ‘feasible’ for the individual to choose among). A ‘choice function’ specifies ‘for any given (sub)set of alternatives, which one will be chosen’? Rationality defined O-R loosely define a rational individual as an individual who: has a preference relation (as defined above) over (any) set \\(X\\), is aware of the set of possible alternatives (whenever she needs to choose), and always “chooses an alternative that is best according to her preference relation over the set of possible alternatives”. But this allows any set of preferences; even ‘preference for apparent pain’. This is perhaps a ‘weak’ definition of rationality. Let’s call this rational individual ‘Ratchell’. Utility-maximizing choice If… Ratchell’s preferences can be represented by the utility function* \\(u\\) and he is rational in the sense defined above (he chooses the ‘best feasible option’ according to his preferences) … …then his ‘choice function’ will solve the ‘problem’ \\[ max\\{u(x): x \\in A\\}\\]. We read this as “he chooses x to maximize the utility function \\(u(x)\\) under the constraint that \\(x\\) is in the ‘feasible’ set \\(A\\).”\" \\(A\\) This may be the set of all alternatives Ratchell can afford to buy given his wealth, or the set of combination of goods and liesure time he can consume given his productivity and the prices he faces in the market, etc. Utility “The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity.” Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated, thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, ‘utility’, which is maximised. Utility from two goods (simpler digression) Stepping away from O-R now, we may specify a “utility function” of two goods (or aggregations of goods) \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). This may be familiar from your undergraduate work. If so, you can skip this sub-section and go directly to ‘rationalising choice’ \\[Utility = U(X,Y; other)\\] We can get a lot of insight from considering models of an individual’s preferences over only two goods. These two ‘goods’ could represent, for example: Leisure and ‘goods consumption’ Food and non-food Coffee and tea (holding all else constant) Empirical aside: can we ‘aggregate goods’ in this way? (Unfold below) E.g., considering a 3-good case… do the preferences of bananas vs apples depend on the composition of the (e.g.) housing services bundle, or only on some aggregated measure of ‘housing sevices’. In estimating demand systems and considering price elasticities we may want/need to make such assumptions. (See, e.g., ‘nested logit’ models.) Recall \\(U(X,Y)\\) expresses a function with two arguments, X and Y. \\(U(X,Y)\\) must take some value for every positive value of X and Y. In general a function of X and Y might increase or decrease in either X or Y, or increase over some ranges and decrease over other ranges of these two arguments. For example, consider the function ‘altitude of land in Britain as a function of degrees longitude and latitude’. \\(U(X,Y)\\) expresses a general function; I haven’t specified what this function is. E.g., it could be \\(U(X,Y)=\\sqrt(XY)\\). Individuals’ utility functions may differ, of course. 2.5.2 Rationalizing choice We are not saying people actually consult a utility function or maximize a preference relation. That would be a dumb thing to say. We are considering that ‘people behave as if they are maximizing utility functions’; this is (basically) equivalent to saying “people choose based on preferences that satisfy the above assumptions.” So, what do we really mean? We might consider whether people’s choices are ‘rationalizable’… whether their choices might be explainable by choosing according to a (transitive) preference relation (or maximizing a utility function.) OR’s definition: Note: this definition of rationalizability is distinct from the one I will present when considering game theory. I will give that one a different name. A choice function is rationalizable if there is a preference relation such that for every choice problem the alternative specified by the choice function is the best alternative according to the preference relation. Remember: a choice function assigns a choice to every set of alternatives. For example, suppose the following three alternatives are potentially under consideration… \\(X = \\{a,b,c\\}\\): a: an apple and a carrot b: an apple (and no carrot) c: three apples, four carrots, and a spiderman costume There are four possible ‘non-trivial’ choice sets among these alternatives (unfold): \\(\\{a,b\\}\\): Choose between ‘an apple and a carrot’ and ‘only an apple’ \\(\\{a,c\\}\\): Choose between ‘1 apple and 1 carrot’ and ‘3 apples, 4 carrots, and 1 spiderman costume’ \\(\\{b,c\\}\\): … \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\): Choose between ‘1 apple and 1 carrot’, ‘1 apple and no carrot’, and ‘3 apples, 4 carrots, and 1 spiderman costume’ A choice function must assign an individual’s choice to any of the above choice sets. For example it might assign \\(\\{a,b\\} \\rightarrow a\\) \\(\\{a,c\\} \\rightarrow c\\) \\(\\{b,c\\} \\rightarrow b\\) \\(\\{a,b,c\\} \\rightarrow a\\) Could this be ‘rationalised’ by any preferences? (Unfold) No it can not! See O-R example 3.1 for a further discussion. In fact, in observed data, people seem to often make choices with intransitivities. There are other ‘choice rules’ that we might imagine people use that also cannot be rationalised by any preferences. For example (O-R 2.3), … suppose… From any set A of available alternatives, the individual chooses a median alternative. This example relates to a proposed ‘middle-choice’ norm in behavioral economics. (Unfold…) It is at least folk wisdom that customers tend to choose ‘middle choices’ (e.g., a ‘medium Coke’) among a set of alternatives. Note that this means that even unchosen ‘irrelevant alternatives’ may affect their behavior. E.g., if offered “Set S”: {10ml, 50ml, 100ml} this person chooses 50ml. But if offered “Set L” {50ml, 100ml, 200ml}, this person chooses 100ml. But the 50ml and 100ml were available in both sets S and L. IN this hypothetical example, the ‘irrelevant alternative’ changed their choice! As O-R show (Example 2.2., p 19), this choice function cannot be rationalised (unless we re-define the choices in terms of their position, see O-R discussion.) Is this rationalizable? : The waiter informs him … he may have either broiled salmon at 2.50 USD or steak at 4.00 USD. … he elects the salmon. Soon after the waiter returns from the kitchen … to tell him that fried snails and frog’s legs are [also available] for 4.50 USD each. … his response is “Splendid, I’ll change my order to steak”. This comes from (???), as cited by O-R. O-R (Ex 2.3) explain why this seemingly perverse behavior could be rationalizable, because of the information conveyed. O-R’s example ‘2.4 Partygoer’ is also interesting; I think the point here is that in a social setting these alternatives cannot be depicted simply as discrete options. The ‘offers made and accepted’ is part of the value of each alternative. This translation from straightforward payoffs to payoffs that depend on the nature of the strategic interaction is explored in my paper ‘Losing Face’ (???) (as well as in much previous work; I’m just self-promoting here). 2.5.2.1 Property \\(\\alpha\\) The above ‘violations’ and the discussion of ‘irrelevant alternatives’ relate to what O-R refer to as: **Property $%: Given a set X, a choice function \\(c\\) for \\(X\\) satisfies property \\(\\alpha\\) if … for any sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) with \\(B \\subset A \\subseteq X\\) and \\(c(A) \\in B\\) we have \\(c(B) = c(A)\\). Explaining the above notation: “a choice function \\(c\\) for \\(X\\)”: a function \\(c\\) that takes any of the choice sets made from the elements of \\(X\\) as an argument, and outputs the choice made. “for any sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) with \\(B \\subset A \\subseteq X\\)”: For any choice sets where \\(B\\) is a ‘proper subset of \\(A\\)’… - “proper subset”… meaning that set \\(A\\) has all the elements that set \\(B\\) has, and \\(A\\) also has at least one more element. For example, B: {fish, giraffe}, is a proper subset of A: {fish, giraffe, turnip}. “\\(A \\subseteq X\\)”: \\(A\\) is subset of \\(X\\)… it contains none, some or all of the elements in \\(X\\) (but \\(A\\) doesn’t contain any elements that are not in \\(X\\)) “… and \\(c(A) \\in B\\):” Where the choice made when presented with set \\(A\\) is also part of choice set \\(B\\). “… we have \\(c(B) = c(A)\\)”: the same element must then be chosen when presented with sets \\(A\\) or \\(B\\). In other words: Property-\\(\\alpha\\) requires that if you make a particular choice (say ‘fish’) from a larger menu (\\(A\\)) you must also choose ‘fish’ when you are given a reduced version of that menu. Going in the other direction… Suppose I choose ‘fish’ from a small menu (\\(B\\)). Next I am presented a menu \\(A\\) that includes all of menu \\(B\\) plus (e.g.) some ‘dairy choices’. Property \\(\\alpha\\) says that if I don’t choose any of the new ‘dairy choices’ on this larger menu, I must continue to choose the fish. The ‘irrelevant alternatives’ can not affect my choice. O-R Proposition 2.1: Every rationalizable choice function satisfies property \\(\\alpha\\). If (A) a choice function is rationalizable then (B) it must satisfy property \\(\\alpha\\). \\((A) \\rightarrow (B)\\). 2.5.3 Satisficing People may say they choose by “choosing the first option that meets a level that is ‘good enough’, and then I quit”. O-R formalise this in their section 2.4. This choice procedure is rationalizable (You can skim this, you don’t need to do the proof.) This should not be confused with ‘search models’ and the ‘optimal stopping problem’. We are not considering search costs here. 2.5.4 The ‘Money pump’ argument One argument for why choices must reflect transitive preferences is that “behavior that is inconsistent with rationality could produce choices that harm the individual” (O-R, p. 23). Perhaps we should imagine that biological evolution would have ‘weeded out’ such individuals, or that their parents would teach them to do otherwise. Consider: If you found someone who strictly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them. How would you illustrate this? This is easiest to illustrate if we allow these goods to be non-discrete and assume ‘more is always better’… this is a bit of a fudge, but it’s OK. Unfold for a simple depiction It works as follows: Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry. Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of banana (or ‘money’). Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra. Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra. … Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you’ve drained all of their resources. O-R present this slightly more formally (you can skip the formality if you like). An interesting video discussing this Becoming a money pump, Nick Chater, Warwick business school An interesting discussion of ‘money pumps’ (and ‘Dutch books’) in terms of preferences and financial markets. I’ve seen this chocolate beverage argument presented for why people should not have ‘wide zones of indifference’. 2.5.5 Framing and ‘decoy options’ O-R next present a case where a third ‘decoy’ option has a substantial affect on people’s choices, even though people rarely choose it! The standard story: “A” is better than “B” in one dimension, but worse in another dimension; people are evenly split between A and B. However, if a third alternative “C” is added to the choice set, and C is ‘worse in all ways than B’ (but still better than A in some ways). Now people tend to choose B. This ‘decoy effect’ (aka, “asymmetrically dominated choice”, aka “the attraction effect” ) is widely discussed in behavioral economics and marketing. Dan Ariely gives a presentation on this below; see also this article in ‘The Conversation’. O-R next discuss ‘framing effects’ in the context of roulette wheel choices; people make distinct choices in choice problems that are identical, other than the way that they are described. The ‘decoy effect’ is (arguably) not a framing effect, because the choice set is actually changing. We will come back to framing effects when we consider decisions about uncertainty, and the idea of ‘loss aversion’. Clearly these cannot reflect rationalizable preferences unless we make the description part of the preference itself. "],["prefs-ex.html", "Exercises: Preferences, utility and choice (‘problem set’): Exercises: Preferences and utility Exercises: Choice", " Exercises: Preferences, utility and choice (‘problem set’): Exercises: Preferences and utility We will also have a discussion and writing exercise (time permitting) on the realism of particular assumptions and on ‘observing preferences and observing violations of transitivity’ (Highly optional): Properties of binary relations - O-R problem 1a. The problem begins… Assume that \\(\\succsim\\) is a preference relation. … Defining ‘strictly preferred to’ “\\(\\succ\\)”: \\(x \\succ y\\) if \\(x \\succsim y\\) and not \\(y \\succsim x\\). … Please read O-R (p. 13) for the full problem description. Osborne and Rubinstein have requested that we not post their problem sets (neither questions nor answers) directly on the web. I will engage with students on these directly. Think about this and give it a try. You can skip the ‘antisymmetric’ part. I will share a suggested answer. I assign this problem to give you a sense of: ‘How the \\(\\succ\\) operator is defined based on the \\(\\succsim\\) operator’ (as previously asserted) What proofs look like using these operators. Consider this optional… but at least worth having a quick look at to understand the proof. Shepard Scale and Penrose stairs (O-R problem 6) Figure 2.3: MC Escher: Penrose stairs … See O-R chapter 1 problem 6, page 14. (The video HERE combines these examples.) Think about the question they ask, and write a short answer. We will discuss this. Representations with additive utility [O-R 9b] An individual has preferences over the set of units (Skip part A: “Show that the individual’s preference are consistent with a preference relation.”) Try part B… here we consider whether this person’s preferences can be represented by a utility function that is additive in the number of rooms and the floor. I.e., a utility function that is the sum of two functions, one that is a function of the floor (\\(\\ell\\)), and another that is a function of the number of rooms (r). For example \\(r^2 + exp(l)\\) would is the sum of the functions \\(f(r)=r^2\\) and \\(g(\\ell)= exp(\\ell)\\). It turns out that it cannot be represented by a utility function that is additive in this way… (Note that the given the \\(r\\) and \\(\\ell\\) functions simply identify the number of rooms and the floor of a unit, they are not ‘really’ functions.) Think about it, try it; we will discuss the answer in some detail. Exercises: Choice To be determined. The exercises in O-R are possibly too mathematical. For now, please be sure you can do all the ‘comprehension questions’ throughout the above section.

This material is largely drawn from O-R Chapter 3, but I also consult a number of other sources as well as my own notes. You are advised to read most of this O-R chapter along with this web-book. But please see my notes below on what you can skip. Here we follow the order of O-R in covering preferences under uncertainty before consumer behavior and demand. Either ordering is possible, but the idea is to fully cover the ‘primitives’ of the model before considering it’s implications. 3.1 Introduction Previous discussion: Choices with known consequences But in the real world many important economic decisions involve uncertainty. Here: Choices with unknown consequences (but known probabilities of each outcome) Adv: In the real world, people may also make choices in contexts with unknown probabilities; this is called ‘ambiguity’ or ‘Knightian uncertainty’. This is out of the scope of this module. (But this is the sort of extension that may motivate a good project). How can we consider this in a choice (or utility-maximisation) framework? The standard framework for this involves maximising ‘expected utility’. Making choices to maximise expected utility is not the same as making choices to maximise expected monetary outcomes. This is one of the main points here. Do not get this mixed up! You must understand this distinction to consider yourself an ‘intermediate microeconomist’ or better.

For a popular audience: Reinstein (2016) ‘Should you hedge your bets on a Brexit?’ LINK 3.2 Probability concepts and notation (including sums and integrals): a quick review You must understand the logic and notation of probability to understand this (and much more material in your degree). If you already know this stuff, feel free to skip/skim. Probability (informal definition) The relative frequency with which an event occurs, or can be expected to occur. Always between 0 and 1 Note, there are some debates, e.g., between ‘Bayesians’ and ‘Frequentists’ over the meaning of probability. Q: If \\(p\\) is the probability an event occurs, what is the probability this event does not occur? Ans: \\(1-p\\) If you didn’t find this obvious, I would suggest seriously revising simple probability, perhaps using the Khan academy materials. Some of the discussion of these probability basics comes from Anne Greenbaum Wash U notes) 3.2.1 Discrete Random Variables The O-R chapter on uncertainty considers only discrete ‘lotteries’ … those with a finite number of prizes. However, outcomes described by continuous random variables will likely come up in other material, and these are extremely important for Finance, as well as for Econometrics and many other fields. A discrete random variable \\(X\\) takes on values \\(x_i\\) with probability \\(p_i\\), \\(i=1, \\ldots, m\\), where \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i = 1\\). For example, the outcome of a lottery ticket that pays a prize of £100 with probability \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), a prize of £10 with probability \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\), and nothing (£0) with the remaining \\(\\frac{4}{10}\\) … can be naturally expressed as a discrete random variable. The expected value (EV) of a discrete random variable \\(X\\) is defined as \\[E(X) \\equiv \\langle X \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^m p_i x_i\\] …also called the mean of the random variable \\(X\\), denoted as \\(\\mu\\). Also see the ‘variance’ and other ‘moments’. 3.2.2 Continuous Random Variables A ‘continuous random variable’ takes on any of an infinite number of values within a range. An example: the possible exact duration of rainfall (in hours, seconds, milliseconds….) to fall on Exeter in Summer 2025 is most naturally expressed as a continuous random variable. If it has no ‘mass points’ then we can only express the probability of it falling within an interval. If you are not familiar with this concept, you should try to understand it, at least for your studies in general; consult Khan academy and other tutorials. This is a very important concept but takes some time to fully comprehend. Cumulative distribution function: \\[ F(x) \\equiv \\mbox{Prob}(X &lt; x ),\\] This is essentially a function that specifies “the probability of random variable \\(X\\) falling (at or) below some level x.” E.g., \\(F_r(103.4) = \\mbox{Prob}(X &lt; 103.4 )\\)… “the probability of 103.4 hours or fewer of rainfall (\\(X\\)) in Exeter for Summer 2025”. The probability density function (pdf). \\[ f (x)\\,dx \\equiv \\mbox{Prob}( X \\in [ x, x+\\,dx ] ) = F(x+\\,dx ) - F(x) .\\] This function is not really interpretable on its own. You might be tempted to read it as ‘the probability of exactly a certain value, such as ’exactly 103.4 hours of rainfall’, but this would be incorrect (unless we have mass points). It is best thought of as the ‘rate of change’ of the CDF, as the limit of the difference in the CDF function for each small interval. Letting \\(dx \\rightarrow 0\\): \\[ f (x) = F&#39; (x) ,~~~F(x) = \\int_{- \\infty}^{x} f (t)\\,dt .\\] Todo: look up and include some graphics showing the pdf and cdf. The expected value (EV) of a continuous random variable \\(X\\) is then defined by \\[ E(X) = \\int_{- \\infty}^{\\infty} x f (x)\\,dx .\\] Note that by definition, \\(\\int_{- \\infty}^{\\infty} f (x)\\,dx = 1\\). Expected value The ‘average outcome’ of an uncertain variable (general definition) The average monetary (or goods) payoff from an uncertain gamble The sum of the value at each possible outcome, weighted by the probability that outcome will occur When outcomes are in a continuous space, e.g., the returns to a stock can take any of an infinite number of possible values, the expected value becomes a definite integral rather than a sum. This is NOT the same as expected utility (coming up); people don’t necessary choose the investment with the highest expected value! 3.3 “Lotteries” O-R, p. 31: An alternative in the set involves randomness regarding the consequence it yields. We refer to these alternatives as lotteries. For example, a raffle ticket that yields a car with probability 0.001 and nothing otherwise is a lottery. A vacation on which you will experience grey weather with probability 0.3 and sunshine with probability 0.7 can be thought of as a lottery as well. 3.3.1 Formal definition of Lotteries (from O-R), explanation Let \\(Z\\) be a set (of prizes). \\(Z\\) could be a list of amounts, say \\(\\{0,10,100\\}\\) or a list of bundles of goods, say {(nothing),(apple and carrot), (two carrots)}. A lottery over \\(Z\\) is a function \\(p : Z \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\)… that assigns a positive number (probability) \\(p(z)\\) to a finite number of members of \\(Z\\) and \\(0\\) to all other members, Simplifying this, the probability function \\(p\\) ‘tells you the probability of each outcome (\\(z\\)) among the set of possible outcomes (\\(Z\\))’ for this lottery. (Recall ) with \\(\\sum_{z \\in Z} p(z) = 1\\). (Unfold for further explanation of this) The sum of the probabilities of each possible outcome must be 1… ‘one of the possibilities must happen’. (Note that this also implies that no individual probability can exceed 1, so \\(0 \\leq p(z) 1\\) for all ‘possibilities’ \\(z\\).) We denote the set of all lotteries over \\(Z\\) by \\(L(Z)\\) (Unfold) For the example I give above, this means \\(L(Z)\\) is ’any possible lottery with some some probability of “apple and carrot”, some probability of “two carrots”, and (the remaining) probability of “nothing”. Each of these probabilities could be anything between 0 and 1. the lottery that yields the prize \\(z\\) with probability 1 by [z] \\([z]\\) represents a trivial case (sometimes called a ‘degenerate’ lottery). A ‘certainty’ is also a lottery, by this definition. and the lottery that yields the prize \\(z_k\\) with probability \\(\\alpha_k\\) for \\(k = 1,..., K\\) I.e., each prize \\(z_k\\) occurs with probability \\(\\alpha_k\\) … so \\(\\z_1\\) occurs with probability \\(\\alpha_1\\), etc. by \\(\\alpha_1 \\cdot z_1 \\oplus \\alpha_2\\cdot z_2 \\oplus ··· \\oplus \\alpha_K \\cdot z_K\\) This is a very handy notation but it needs some explanation (unfold). We are trying to concisely depict a lottery with K possible outcomes (where K can be any number). Each of these possibile outcomes is indicated by \\(z_1\\), \\(z_2\\), … etc., all the way up to \\(z_K\\). Each of these possibities has some probability of occuring. We denote these possibilities by \\(\\alpha_1\\) for outcome \\(z_1\\), \\(\\alpha_2\\) for outcome \\(z_2\\), etc. E.g., for a two-outcome lottery, rather than writing ‘a lottery where outcome \\(z_1\\) occurs with probability \\(\\alpha_1\\), \\(z_2\\) occurs with probability \\(\\alpha_2\\), etc., we can simply write it as \\(\\alpha_1 \\cdot z_1 \\oplus \\alpha_2\\cdot z_2\\). Here the \\(\\oplus\\) means ’and also outcome…’ and the \\(\\cdot\\) means ‘with probability’. How would you use this notation to depict “a lottery with a 1/3 probability of an outcome with value 10, and a 2/3 probability of an outcome with value 100”? \\(10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\oplus 100\\cdot \\frac{2}{3}\\) Consider the diagrams in figure 3.1 in O-R. Can you explain what the points depicted mean? Could you depict the lottery \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot z_1 \\oplus \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot z_2 \\oplus 0\\cdot z_3\\) in a 3-D diagram similar to figure 3.1b? (by the way, this is called a ‘probability simplex’). 3.4 Preferences over lotteries We now have the tools consider the question that motivated this: how might an individual choose among a set of uncertain choices, and what can we say about this? Formally, what are the “preferences over the set of lotteries \\(L(Z)\\)” and “what restrictions over these preferences seem reasonable”? O-R consider some ‘examples’ of preferences (or categories of preferences) over these lotteries that may seem rather extreme; We might instead consider these as “simple decision rules” or “heuristics” rather than actual preferences. Behavioral economics considers that people may adopt such simplifying rules instead of maximizing perfectly in the complete set of alternatives, particularly because such maximization is mentally costly. Of course it is doubtful that anyone completely has these preferences or follows these rules all the time. Still, it is instructive to consider what doing so would mean. It’s worth reading these definitions carefully, and then we can consider how these diverge from the “expected utility” framework we will discuss in a moment. Ex. 3.1 “A pessimist”: Essentially, someone whose preferences among these lotteries simply depends on “which one has the worst possible outcome (\\(w(p)\\)) that is least bad”. (Where ‘worst’ is according to some particular ranking… which can have any form.) Ex 3.2 “good and bad”: This person divides all possible outcomes into “good outcomes” and “bad outcomes” (in some particular way…there are many possibilities for doing this.) They simply prefer the lottery which has the highest probability of a “good” outcome (or conversely the lowest probability of a bad outcome). Ex 3.3 minimizing options: This person doesn’t actually care about the content of any of the outcomes; they simpler prefer the lottery with the fewest possible outcomes. This seems to me to be a sort of ‘opposite extreme’ to the pessimistic preference. While the pessimist is extremely sensitive to the very worst thing, the “good and bad” person is insensitive to whether the “good things” are ‘really good or just OK’ or whether the bad things\" are really bad or just a bit mediocre. 3.5 Properties of preferences (O-R 3.2.1) Continuity (see diagram I will add) “Some probablistic mix of a great thing and a terrible thing will be as good as an OK thing” Counterexample: Pessimistic preferences (counterexamples help illustrate the ‘bite’ of a property) Def: Compound lotteries Important; might be considered an ‘algebra of finance’… a distributed format ‘sum product of x across all lotteries \\(p_1...p_k\\)’ Def: Independence “If I prefer a particular (certain) A over a particular lottery B, I also prefer to increase the probability of A over B… in a ‘compound lottery’” Counterexamples: pessimistic preferences, ‘minimizing options’ Note that a property over \\(\\succsim\\) extends to \\(\\succ\\) Relevant to ‘population ethics’ and ‘effective altruism’ and ‘other-regarding preferences’, and ‘social welfare functions/social preferences’. Def: Monotonicity “A lottery (between two things) gets better as the better thing gets more likely” Independence implies monotonicity; a fairly easy and cool proof. 3.6 Expected utility The ‘most commonly assumed’ framework in economic theory. 3.7 Applications (esp. to finance): How do we express and measure ‘risk aversion’? How does this affect (financial, investment, insurance) choices? Why does ‘diversification improve outcomes for the risk-averse’? How does this affect asset prices (Stocks, bonds, etc.) with ‘efficient markets’ (this will be briefly defined) Behavioral Economics: the “Allais Paradox” (first treatment, time-permitting) "],["prefs-uncert.html", "Exercises - uncertainty, finance, time preferences (‘problem set’)", " Exercises - uncertainty, finance, time preferences (‘problem set’) Tbd; some possibilities in the fold.

It may seem like we have the answers, but this is only where we have asked the questions very carefully But sometimes ignorance is bliss. Examples: Sunk-cost fallacy, gains to trade/comparative advantage, opportunity cost, free-riding/prisoners’ dilemma, double-marginalization,‘raise price to raise profit’, etc. I’ve had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife. Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out. We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a ‘single representative consumer’. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights. However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or testing these models, be careful; people may differ and they may change and they may have multiple motives. 9.2 Supplement: market imperfections can suggest business opportunities A major theme in Economics is: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets \\(\\rightarrow\\) opportunities. Although we are not focusing on ‘market failure’ in this module (BEEM101, 2020)… I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse. I’m not telling you what you need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics. I also believe that these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks. Here are some possible examples. Imperfection: Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘All you can eat’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for ‘all-you-can-eat’ And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later. Free-riding on public goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) Disneyworld, resorts We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride. They then charge an admission fee to ‘be inside of Disney World’ and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods. Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Uber, AirBnb Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves). Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Tinder Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high. A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit. If you’re interested, see my research on this here, presentation slides here, my research page is here. Asymmetric information, adverse selection \\(\\rightarrow\\) NHS, ‘Obamacare’ This one is a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA. Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later). There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance (or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well. Note: Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you ‘outsource’ and when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do? Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly.

Studies of honeybees have found that they generally do not gather all of the nectar in a particular flower before moving on. Why not? What key features do modern human economies have that ‘animal economies’ don’t have? Largely: trade, prices, specialisation, free choice vs instinct. The economics of trade may also apply to the natural world in certain ways. Above, we see the working of ant-aphid symbiosis, a form of mutualism. Relevant to the ‘conditions necessary for trade to occur’? The ants ‘farm’ the aphids, who secrete nice substances. In return the ants protect the aphids and only sometimes eat them. 9.4 Supplement: Empirical research Empirical research Uses evidence from the real world, i.e., observation, to answer questions (rather than introspection and theory) Econometrics The ‘science’ of using data to answer economic questions Uses statistical tools and often economic theory Micro-data Data where the unit of observation is an individual, household, firm, etc. (Contrasts from macro-data, data on aggregates like GDP, inflation, etc.) See, e.g., Euro-stat microdata Data on individual donations (at the donor level) from a large scale field experiment (Karlan and List) downloadable HERE Price and product data on gluten-free bread at the supermarket level ‘Macro-data’ This is contrasted from ‘Macro-data’ which is aggregated/averaged in some way (e.g., at the country-level or industry-level) E.g., Computer penetration and income by year and Chinese province Suicide, mental health, and GDP by country and year Econometrics often has a different focus and different methodology than ‘regular statistics’. Econometrics has taken on a larger role in economics over the past 40 years, because of greater data availability and computing power. Most published papers in economics now involve some econometric analysis.“,”RawSienna\")` Throughout the module we will come back to the discussion of empirical work, testing, measuring, and estimating. 9.4.1 Empirical meta-example Suppose we are trying to estimate the market demand curve; suppose we hypothesize that this demand curve is a linear function. (I.e., suppose we assume that quantity demanded is a linear function of price). \\[Q_d = a-bp\\] Suppose we know that price is changing because of cost changes, shifts in supply curve, or the firm experimenting. Otherwise the problem is poorly identified, as demand and supply will jointly determine price We observe price and quantity data for a period where ceteris paribus is reasonable, such as the data below1 We try to fit the ‘best’ line through these points (minimizing the distances between the line and the points, or minimizing the ‘error’ of this predicted quantity). We estimate the demand curve’s slope and intercept. We can use this to make inferences. This line will never fit exactly, because of unobserved differences, nonlinear demand, measurement error, randomness in behaviour. But this fitted line is only meaningful if we are observing shifts in the supply curve and not the demand curve! (Can you explain why?) Some more in-depth discussions of estimating demand and/or supply curves: From Econometric online text, Shalabh, IIT Kanpurhttp://home.iitk.ac.in/~shalab/econometrics/Chapter17-Econometrics-SimultaneousEquationsModels.pdf) Notes on estimating these models in R using 2sls 9.4.2 Ceteris paribus All [most] economic theories employ the assumption that ‘other things are held constant.’ In above data/figure, demand may differ between weeks/stores, weather may change, etc. ‘the points may lie on several different demand curves, and attempting to force them into a single curve would be a mistake.’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) We would like to carefully ‘control’ for other observable factors May also use flexible functions permitting heterogeneity – differing slopes. We can never control for everything or know ‘true’ functional form. Sadly, all empirical work involves imperfect compromises. But happily there are ways to test and validate the estimates, e.g., see how well they predict future outcomes. 9.4.3 Exogenous and endogenous variables Suppose a model of supply and demand with ‘exogenous shifters’: \\(W\\) is an external or exogenous variable that increases the quantity demanded at any price E.g., the amount of a windfall tax rebate, boosting net income \\(Z\\) is an exogenous variable that makes production more costly, increasing the price firms require to supply a particular quantity E.g., the level of the minimum wage, or e.g., energy prices We can then write the supply and demand model as: \\[Q=-P+W\\] \\[P=Q+Z\\] P and Q are the endogenous variables Don’t ask ‘how does P change in Q?’ W and Z are the exogenous variables If we know W and Z we can solve for the equilibrium Q and P Can observe how this equilibrium responds to shifts in Q and P 9.4.4 More advanced material on causal inference -The mixtape, Scott Cunningham pp 18-22, and more Autor, MIT ‘Microeconomic theory and public policy’, lecture 2 We now consider the very very fundamental building blocks behind the (in)famous ‘neoclassical economics model.’ Accept these ’axioms and nearly everything flows from it!
