# Introduction/'housekeeping', overview, models, maths, fundamentals {#intro}

This, combined with the above outline represents approximately half a week of material

## This chunk aims to cover: {-#intro-coverage}

1. What Microeconomics is about and why it is useful

2. What the point of 'models' are

3. Some *applications* of these models

4. Some examples of microeconomic models and questions (should be largely revision)
    - Get your econ brain flowing

5. Discuss maths revision

6. Discuss 'empirical work' in Microeconomics, and how it connects to 'theory'



**Main reading for this chunk:** this web book

\
Readings on 'what is Economics', 'what are the purpose of Economic models', etc.: The readings below are each optional, but you must read at least some of these*

Unfold to see these...

We will return to the issues of 'what and why models' throughout the module.

**Empirics, maths revision**

<div class="marginnote">
Some of the maths you need will also be simultaneously covered in your Optimisation and Econometric modules, sometimes at a higher level.

2.  Math revision concepts in

- QMC 1.3 (some good stuff; don't worry too much about all the derivative rules)

- The key maths concept for this module: The logic and language of formal definitions and proofs, e.g., 'proof by contadiction', and 'proof by construction'.

### What is Economics? {-}

\
<div class="marginnote">
*Note: DR: It has changed. There are different views. Ask two economists, and you'll probably get at least three answers.*
</div>

What is Economics? Please propose a definition (from your head... give your own impression) as a comment HERE using Hypothes.is. Then unfold the box below to see some proposed definitions and ideas.

```{block2,  type='fold'}

1. “Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.”

2. “Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” Alfred Marshall

-- The first quote suggests an *approach* (*how* we do our research), the second suggests a *domain* (what we focus on).


Another famous quote:
“Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.” - Ludwig von Mises

```



### What is Microeconomics? {-}

One definition: "The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets.""

<br> \bigskip


Largely, using theoretical and mathematical 'models' that depend on strong assumptions.

</div>
 




What sort of models are we talking about?...

<div class="marginnote">
To refresh your memory... you have probably seen some of these models before in your previous economics module. You should have some familiarity with the simple models of supply and demand curves yielding an equilibrium price and quantity. You may also have seen a models of trade, between two countries or two individuals, with only two goods, where for each good one has a 'comparative advantage'. Other models involve 'strategic' interactions bwtween a few 'players'. Others involve individual 'optimizing' choices. Still others involve firms and governments setting 'mechanisms' trying to induce particular choices by others.
</div>


Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications.

A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and ‘general'; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications.

<div class="marginnote">
But I don't find it satisfactory if people respond to a meaningful criticism of a model and the way it is being applied with 'it's just a model, and all models are abstractions.' Specific critiques need to be dealt with directly.
</div>



## The content and meaning of Economic models, theories, and analysis {-}
