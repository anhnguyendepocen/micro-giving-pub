# Preferences, Utility and Choice {#pref-util-choice}


What can we reasonably say about 'what people prefer and choose'? How can we state this carefully and precisely? What are the implications of particular 'reasonable' assumptions? (How) can we consider this in terms of 'optimization'? How have Economists and decision-scientists considered these questions?


```{block2,  type='note'}
Digging deeply into the logic and justifications for these models of choice, and alternative frameworks, will be very relevant in considering Behavioral Economics (This is a specialty of Ariel Rubinstein, one of the O-R text's two authors, and also a research interest of mine). In fact this text works behavioral economics in from the beginning.

This is also relevant for building empirical models such as 'models of consumer choices and preferences' in ways that are relevant to (e.g.) Business-data-analytics consulting.

```


<!-- This will take at least two weeks to cover meaningfully. -->



```{block2,  type='note'}

We approach this in an abstract and logically and mathematically-rigorous, but not highly 'computational' way. Even if you have taken Economics as an undergraduate, you may not have seen this approach.

We will not always be quite so mathematically rigorous throughout the module. However, I want to at least give you some of these tools, and a 'flavour' of this approach, which characterises modern Microeconomics (and will be at the core of PhD modules).
```

## Key goals of this chunk

1. Understand ways preferences are formally modeled. Learn this notation and be able to construct and use these models

2. Consider the meaning and reasonableness of distinct assumptions over preferences

3. Gain some sense of the implications of these models and assumptions for deep questions of human behavior, as well as  practical applied questions

4. Learn how to construct and understand simple mathematical proofs involving preference relations

### Content

```{block2,  type='note'}
**I am adding  content here now**

This will go through the relevant O-R text material and a bit more. However, you should read the relevant sections of O-R alonside this.

```


## Preferences {#preferences}


```{block2,  type='note'}

Note that this excerpts and mainly follows O-R chapter 1. I try to highlight the key points, explain them a bit more, and add some additional content that seems important You must read that chapter *along with* these notes. All quotes are from O-R unles otherwise noted.

```

```{block2,  type='warning'}

This section considers preferences *separately* from choices. Later, we will consider choices as potentially being made according to one's preferences subject to one's constraints.

However, behavioral economics also considers the possibility (and ways in which) individual might make *choices* that in fact to not optimise, even given their own preferences. 

```  


### Preamble


<div class="marginnote">
We now consider the very very fundamental building blocks behind the (in)famous 'neoclassical economics model.' If you accept these 'axioms' nearly everything flows from it! We will also consider alternative assumptions influenced by  behavioral economics.
</div>

### A 'motivating' exercise

<div class="marginnote">
Please feel free to type somw thoughts in the Hypothes.is sidebar, to engage discussion on this.

You can find another 'idea-stimulating' exercise referenced in the O-R book, the questionnaire they give at [http://gametheory.tau.ac.il/exp11/](http://gametheory.tau.ac.il/exp11/). It's worth doing as they refer to it later in several parts of the book.
</div>


```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Consider a decision you recently made?  Define this decision clearly; what were the options?  How do you think you decided among these options?

What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the same decision?

If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same situation again. Do you think you'd make the same decision?

```

```{r  fig.cap = 'Am I blowing your mind here?', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/mortys-mind-blower.png")
```


\

```{block2,  type='inputq'}
Next, suppose I asked you:   'State a rule that governs how people *do* make decisions'...

I want this rule to be both

1. Informative (it rules *out* at least some sets of choices) and

2. Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule).

```
\



Now suppose I asked an apparently similar question:

```{block2,  type='inputq'}

'State a rule that governs how people *should* make decisions'..


By 'should' I mean that *they will not regret having made decisions in this way.*


If people *did* follow these rules, what would this imply and predict?

```




Economists (and decision theorists/decision scientists) have specifically defined such rules in terms of 'axioms about preferences'

They have started from these 'reasonable axioms' and followed their logical implications for individual choices, individual responses to changes in prices and income, market prices and quantities and their responses, 'welfare' and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc.

The 'Standard axioms' (imply that) choices can be expressed by 'individuals maximising *utility functions* subject to their *budget constraints*'.

This yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc. We will get to this.


```{block2,  type='note'}

We want to develop a model that can be used to show how we make choices or decisions.

In the (neo) classical economics framework, your (optimising) choices are determined by two things:

1. Preferences: what goods do you like?

2. Constraints: how much money do you have, what are the prices of the goods you buy?

```

### Preferences: Notation, definition, explanation {-}

O-R give some background

> We follow the approach almost all economic theory and characterize an individual by her preferences among the alternatives, without considering the origin of these preferences. they nicely explain the why unlike many texts

<div class="marginnote">
And unlike many other texts, O-R *explain* that they are doing this.
</div>


\

What sort of 'preferences' are we considering? Just 'ordinal' ones, at least for now:

> When we express preferences, we make statements like “I prefer a to b”, “I like a much better than b”, ...

> In this book [as is standard]  the model of preferences captures only statements of the first type... [the *ranking*]


\

> We can think of an individual’s preferences over a set of alternatives as encoding the answers to a questionnaire. For every pair $(x, y)$ of alternatives in the set,  the questionnaire asks the individual which of the following three statements fits best his attitude to the alternatives.

> 1. I prefer x to y.

> 2. I prefer y to x.

> 3. I regard x and y as equally desirable.

<div class="marginnote">
These will later be formally encoded as

1. $x \succ y$,

2. $y \succ x$ (or $x \prec y$),

and

3.  $x \sim y$, or equivalently, $y \sim x$ (formally: because 'equivalence operators are reflexive'),

... respectively. However, as O-R show, these can all in fact be denoted with the careful use of a single 'at least as good' operator.

</div>



\

O-R next discuss 'binary relations' and their properties.


> A binary relation on a set $X$ specifies, for each ordered pair $(x , y )$ of members of X , whether or not x relates to y in a certain way.



***

```{block2,  type='tip'}

This is getting abstract, and unless you've taken some 'pure maths' you may be a bit confused and overwhelmed here. In this case, I will try to help you: the folded content below is a question and answer on this with a student. Beware that this is a digression, so if you already know this stuff, you can skip it.

```


```{block2,  type='fold'}

**Q (from student whom I will call 'Sue'): Not sure the meaning of ‘binary relation’. Does it refer to relationships between two objects?**

**A: Yes, this is a pure maths concept.**8 Think of a 'binary relation' as a computer program that does the following...

1. You enter two objects (say 'peanut butter' and 'jelly')
2. It tells you 'yes, these objects are related' or 'no, they are not related'.

For example, we can apply the binary relationship '$R_s$: objects  go well together in a sandwich' to the above...

'Peanut butter' $R_s$ 'Jelly' $\rightarrow$ `true`

'Peanut butter' $R_s$ 'tuna fish' $\rightarrow$ `false`

\


Another binary relation could be '$R_l$: 'the first object is usually larger than the second one.'  Here we would have:

'Whale' $R_s$ 'Minnow' $\rightarrow$ `true`

'Minnow' $R_s$ 'Whale' $\rightarrow$ `false`


*Sue: Thank you! These examples are great!! I think they would be great to put in the web-book if you are planning to create one.*


<br>

>  For example, “acquaintance” is a binary relation on a set of people. For some pairs $(x , y )$ of people, the statement “x is acquainted with y ” is true, and for some pairs it is false.

(The English word 'acquaintance'  basically means 'has met' or 'knows').

```

\

Continuing with these questions and answers ... (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

**Q: What does the ‘acquaintance’ example mean?**

**A: To give more specific examples,** we could have, for $R_a$: 'is aquainted with':

Sue $R_a$ "Sue's lecturer in the UK" $\rightarrow$ `true`

Sue $R_a$ "Sue's mother" $\rightarrow$ `true`

"Sue's mother" $R_a$ "Sue" $\rightarrow$ `true` (note it is 'reflexive')

"Sue's mother" $R_a$ "Sue's lecturer in the UK" $\rightarrow$ `false` (so it's not 'transitive')

*Sue: I was not sure what 'aquaintance meant in this example. Now I do understand!*

```

\

Another example of a binary relation (unfold Q&A)...


```{block2,  type='fold'}

> Another example of a binary relation is “smaller than” on the set of numbers. For some pairs $(x,y )$ of numbers, x is smaller than y , and for some it is not.

>  For a binary relation R, the expression $x R y$ means that x is related to y according to R. For any pair $(x, y)$ of members of X , the statement $x R y$ either holds or does not hold. For example, for the binary relation < on the set of numbers, we have $3 < 5$, but not $7<1$.

<br>

**Q: Given that R stands for relation, what does $xRy$ means? Does it mean the relationship between x and y?**

**A: It means 'x relates to y, by the relation R'.** If the relation R is 'greater than', then $xRy$ means 'x is greater than y$.

\

**Q: If so, what does yRx mean?**

**A: It means 'y relates to x' .... with the above example it means 'y is greater than x'.**

Sue: Aha!! I see.

```

***

O-R begin with the formal definition of 'at least as desirable as' (or 'seen as at least as good as'). In other words, 

"x is at least as desirable as y" is  denoted $x \succsim y$... 

> if the individual’s answer to the question regarding x and y is either “I prefer x to y” or “I regard x and y as equally desirable”. 


O-R show, that in fact, *all* of the preference relationships can be denoted with the careful use of the $\succsim$ operator. For example:

'Indifference': 

$$x \sim y \text{ if both } x \succsim y \text{ and } y \succsim x$$. 

and

'Strict preference' 


$$x \succ y \text{ if } x \succsim y \text{ but not } y \succsim x$$. 


<div class="marginnote">
Why? In pure maths, and perhaps in economic theory, they value stating a concept with the fewest and most 'primal' definitions possible. 

Technical note: This can help in proving properties of these objects and systems. By characterising something as the simplest mathematical object possible, we can apply all of the properties of that mathematical object that have been proven over the centuries.
</div>


```{block2,  type='inputq'}

Exercise: to be sure you understand these things, close your book/computer and try to reconstruct the construction of strict preferences or indifference from only the $\succsim$ operator. Can you give the intuition for this, explaining it clearly?

```  


\

Below I reprint the 'Venn diagram' of preferences over x an y from the O-R text.

```{r  fig.cap = 'Venn diagram of possible preference relationships (from O-R)', out.width='900%', fig.asp=.7, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/pref-venn-or.png")
```

Note that the set of preferences where 'x and y are equally desirable' is included in both the set 'x is at least as desirable as y' and the set 'y is at least as desirable as x'.


####  *Properties* of preferences (some standard assumptions)  {#pref-prop}

### Completeness {-}


Completeness (informal definition): "Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive."


The following is `r format_with_col("forbidden","red")`: "I cannot choose between a ski holiday and a beach holiday, yet I am not indifferent between these."

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","donkeybales.jpeg"))
```

\

"Why *wouldn't* I be able to express a preference? (Consider this for a moment, and then unfold...)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

In the case above it seems strange to not be able to express a preference. But for other cases it may be extremely difficult or painful to compare two things. Imagine if you were asked to compare 'between 'never seeing your mother' or 'never seeing your father.' In general, economists' standard approach assumes we have a consistent preference ranking over all possibilities, and choose accordingly.  

However, other social sciences see this differently.

```

<div class="marginnote">
Aside: Also 'forbidden' in the classical model: the *time* or *frame* in which I make the *decisions* must not affect my preferences (or choices). This will be relaxed when we discuss behavioral economics.
</div>



**Definition: Completeness** (From O-R)
  
The property that for all alternatives $x$ and $y$ , distinct or not, either $x \succ y$ or $y \succ x$ [or both].   Even more formally...

```{block2,  type='def'}

**Definition (O-R): Complete binary relation**

A binary relation $R$ on the set $X$ is complete if for all members $x$ and $y$ of $X$, either $x R y$ or $y R x$ (or both).

```  

> A complete binary relation is, in particular, *reflexive*: for every $x \in X$ we have $x R x$.

\

In case you are confused, please unfold the Q &A below...


```{block2,  type='fold'}

**Q:	I am still confused with the concept of ‘reflexivity’ after reading these paragraphs. Does it mean all ‘x’ are the same**

  \

**A: Not exactly,** reflexivity is a property (a characteristic) of the *relation* $R$ (where this 'relation' could be 'greater than', 'smaller than', 'equal', 'having the same number of elements', 'preferred to', etc.), not the property of a 'mathematial object' itself.

Reflexivity  holds where an object always "relates to itself". For example, in standard maths the relationship  'greater than or equal to ($\geq$) is reflexive, while the relationship $\gt$ is *not* reflexive.  For any number $x$ the statement $x \geq x$ is true (e.g., $10 \geq 10$ is true because $10=10$). However, the statement $x>x$ is false ... obviously a number cannot be greater than itself! (Only the Queen can exceed her own greatness.)

Sue: Hmmmm, why is $10 \geq 10$ true??? How could 10 possibly be greater than 10? Shouldn't the only correct statement be 10 = 10?
  
DR: Because this is the 'greater than *or* equal to' sign. Of course '10 is greater than or equal to 10' because they are equal. Just as in computer programming, with an 'OR' operator the condition evaluates as true if either (or both) of the conditions are true.

Sue: Ooook, I think I understand it now. It makes sense to me when you linked it with computer programming; **but what is the point of the $\succsim$ sign? Couldn't the authors only use the $\geq$ sign?**

DR: This is in fact a notation from set theory. We are expressing preferences over objects which may not be representable by a single number.
 
\
  
  
Sue: ... **But then why 'completeness' automatically ensures the second property 'reflexivity'? **

DR:  The authors are saying that the first property of the binary relationship, 'completeness' automatically ensures the second property 'reflexivity'. Equivalently (contrapositive statement) "a relationship that is not reflexive can not be complete." 

But they have only *stated* that this is the case. **They have not PROVEN it.** We would have to look up a proof or try to construct it ourselves. They don't give the proof of this in the main text.

```

### Transitivity 


> For a binary relation $\succ$ to correspond to a preference relation, we require not only that it be complete, but also that it be consistent in the sense that if $x \succsim y$ and $y \succsim z$ then $x \succsim z$. This property is called transitivity.


Intuitively: Transitive preferences are 'internally consistent': If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.

\


Formally: 

```{block2,  type='def'}

**Definition: Transitive binary relation** [O-R]
  
A binary relation R on the set X is transitive if for any members x , y , and z of $X$ for which $x R y$ and $y R z$, we have $x R z$.

```


Let's explore this more simply in terms of *strict* preferences, the $\succ$ symbol.

Transitivity means:

$$ A \succ B \: and \: B \succ C \rightarrow A \succ C $$


- If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer an Apple to a Cherry.


- A similar idea holds if I am indifferent between one pair of these.  ($\sim$)


- ... this obviously extends to 'chains' combining these ... so

$$ A \succ B \:\: and \: \: B \sim C \rightarrow A \succ C $$
etc.

We may write this concisely as $A \succ B \sim C$.


```{block2,  type='tip'}

If this seems confusing it may be because it is *too* obvious (although behavioral and experimental economists claim to find violations of this.

```


*If you found someone who striclty preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple,  you could make a lot of money out of them!.*

```{block2,  type='compq'}

Consider: How would you do this? (Unfold below for a description).

```  

```{block2,  type='fold'}

It works as follows (being a bit informal here):

0. Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry.

1. Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of  banana (or 'money').

2. Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra.

3. Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra.

... Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you've drained them of all of their resources.

```
