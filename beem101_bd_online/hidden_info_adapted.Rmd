Introduction
============

Material comes largely from Laffont and Martimort ch. 2[^1]

: The (2001 edition) of the Laffont and Martimort text appears to be
online for free. Look up “THE THEORY OF INCENTIVES I : THE
PRINCIPAL-AGENT MODEL” and you will probably find it.

The key sections to read are ’2.2 The Basic Model’ through 2.7.3
’Shut-down policy’.

This is also partially covered, with a different approach, in the NS
text section ’Adverse Selection: Consumer’s Private Information about
Valuation’

### Introduction: Adverse Selection (Hidden information) and screening

This involves the optimal design of incentives when the agent has
private information on an *unchosen* variable that affects the payoffs.

However, the identical model describes second-degree price
discrimination, setting a menu of prices and quantities/qualities and
getting consumers to self select.

**Motivational example: (Skip in lecture)**

‘Pursuit of Happyness (link)’

<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcZTtlGweQ>

Discuss:

Why would Dean Witter make the internship unpaid? What kind of a person
would take such an internship?

Why would firm give such a huge return to its brokers?

What are the inefficiencies associated with this?

Who is bearing the risk?

### Examples

<span> Firm hires employee of unknown skill or unknown intrinsic
motivation </span>

<span> A landlord delegates the cultivation of land with unknown
productivity to a tenant-farmer </span>

<span> Government (or firm) procurement from (or regulation of) monopoly
firm w/unknown marginal. cost (e.g., NHS services)</span><span>... Or
within a firm (see theory of the firm) </span>

<span> Investor delegates management of his portfolio </span>

### Examples, ‘consumption-side’

Firm sells good to consumer w/ unknown value (2nd degree price discrim.)

Housemates decide which level of TV plan to buy (public good, mechanism
design problem)

Insurance company sells policy to individual of unknown health status

###

**Key features:** The principal would want to reach *allocative
efficiency*, if he could extract all the surplus

... i.e., the proper matching of social marginal cost and marginal
benefit ...

... but, where there is *hidden information*, this conflicts with the
incentive compatibility constraints of the agent ...

... the principal may set a separate contract for each type, and hopes
they will ‘self-select’ (this is called *screening*)...

...this leads to a second best set of contracts that reduces allocative
efficiency to minimize the *information rents* paid to agents.

### Example “Listen to the market, hear the best policy decision, but don’t always choose it” by Reinstein and Song (2014)

**Abstract:**

Policymakers must often decide whether to pursue a policy that has
uncertain benefits. The response of asset markets to proposed policy
changes can be a valuable source of information for policy-setting.
However, policymakers must take into account that an informed trader may
anticipate this and profitably manipulate the market. We show that it is
optimal for policymakers to listen to asset markets, but they must
commit (e.g., through “political capital”) to sometimes pursuing a
policy even when the expected welfare effects are negative.
Surprisingly, allowing traders to short-sell can make it easier for
policymakers to induce truth-telling actions.

Basic Model
===========

### Basic Model (two types)

<span>Principal delegates production to agent:
</span>$q$<span> units.</span>

<span>U(Principal)= </span>$S(q)$

<span>Where </span>$S(0)=0$ <span>, </span>
$S^{\prime }(0)>\bar{\theta}>0$ <span>, and </span>
$S^{\prime \prime }(.)<0$ <span> (</span> $\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }$

$F$

<span>Marginal cost
</span>$\theta\in\{\underline{\theta},\bar{\theta}\} $<span>, where
</span>$\underline{\theta}<\bar{\theta}$ .

<span>U(agent) </span>$ = t - \theta q$ <span>(her payment, net of
costs)</span>

<span>Total cost of production of </span>$q$<span> units is given
by</span>

$$ C(q,\theta) & =F+\theta q$$
$$\theta & \in\{\bar{\theta},\underline{\theta}\}$$

![image](lm_fig-2-2.png)

Note that these are steeper for the higher cost agent as producing more
is more costly for her.

### A Contract

P offers a “take it or leave it” (TIOLI) contract to A

Contract: a quantity $q$ and a payment $t$ corresponding to each
quantity.

Full Information/First-Best case
--------------------------------

### Principal’s objective; FULL INFORMATION CASE

$$\begin{aligned}
& \max E(\Pi )=\Pi =\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}E(S(q)-t(q)) \\
\\
\text{ \textit{s.t.} }t_{lc}-\underline{\theta } q_{lc}& \geq 0 \tag{PC$_{FB,lc}$} \\
\text{ \emph{and} } \\
t_{hc}-\bar{\theta} q_{hc}& \geq 0 \tag{PC$_{FB,hc}$}\\
\\
\text{for }\theta & \in \{\underline{\theta },\bar{\theta}\}\text{, }q\in
\{q_{lc},q_{hc}\}\end{aligned}$$

Participation constraint only; separate contract to each type – no need
for self-selection because $P$ can discriminate (assuming this is
legally possible!).

### ...

Must induce (each type of) $A$ to accept contract

No reason to overcompensate $A$ $\Longrightarrow$ Constraint binds
$\Longrightarrow $

$t = \theta q$ $\Longrightarrow$ Maximize $S(q)-\theta q$

$\Longrightarrow q^{FB}(\theta)$ solves $S^{\prime }(q^{FB})=\theta$ for
each type, (from strict concavity of $S$)

### ...

$\Longrightarrow$ Optimal contracts $C^{FB}=\{q^{FB}(\theta)$,
$t=F+q^{FB}(\theta)\times\theta \}$; for
$\theta \in \{\underline{\theta }$, $\bar{\theta}\}$.

In other words $t_{lc}=F+q^{FB}_{lc}\underline{\theta}$ and
$q_{lc}=q^{FB}_{lc}$

and $t_{hc}=F+q^{FB}_{hc}\bar{\theta}$ and $q_{hc}=q^{FB}_{hc}$

![image](lm_2-3_firstbest.png)

Incomplete information case
---------------------------

### *Incomplete* information contracts

*Principal’s beliefs*: type $\underline{\theta }$ with probability $v$,
type $\bar{\theta}$ with probability $1-v$.

$P$ offers contracts
$\mathbf{C}^{SB}=\{(q_{lc},t_{lc}),(q_{hc},t_{hc})\}$

Each contract is implicitly supposed to attract a particular type of
agent (self-selection).

### Cannot achieve first-best (not at the same cost)

$\mathbf{C}^{FB}$cannot be implemented here.

*Sketch*: Under $\mathbf{C}^{FB}$, both types of agent will strictly
prefer to accept the contract
$\{q_{hc}^{FB},t_{hc}=F+q_{hc}^{FB}\bar{\theta}\}$.  This is not optimal
for the principal if agent is of type $\underline{\theta }
$. Note:
$q_{hc}^{FB}\bar{\theta}-q_{hc}^{FB}\underline{\theta }=(\bar{\theta}-\underline{\theta })q_{hc}^{FB}>0$,
so low-cost type’s IC constraint not met at $\mathbf{C}^{FB}$.

### IC and PC Constraints

<span>A set of contracts </span>$\{(q_{lc},t_{lc}),(q_{hc},t_{hc})\}$
<span>is incentive compatible for type
</span>$\underline{\theta }$<span> if:</span>

$$t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}\geq t_{hc}-\underline{\theta }q_{hc}
\tag{IC(\underline{$\theta $})}$$

<span>Similarly, a set of contracts
</span>$\{(q_{lc},t_{lc}),(q_{hc},t_{hc})$<span> is incentive compatible
for type </span>$\bar{\theta}$<span> if:</span>

$$t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}\geq t_{lc}-\bar{\theta}q_{lc}
\tag{IC($\bar{\theta}$)}  \label{IC2}$$

###

<span>The corresponding participation constraints are simply that the
contracts yield non-negative utility (reservation wage assumed to be
0)</span>:

$$t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}\geq 0 \tag{PC($\underline{\theta }$)}$$

$$t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}\geq 0  \tag{PC($\bar{\theta}$)}$$

### Important Special Cases

<span>Bunching/pooling:</span> Single contract for both types. Incentive
constraints trivially satisfied, and the PC of the $\underline{\theta }$
type is weaker than for the $\bar{\theta}$ type. So we only need to
check one constraint for this type of contract.

<span>Shut Down:</span> A $\{0,0\}$ contract for high type and a regular
contract for the low cost type. This implicitly involves a shut down of
the high cost type.

Low cost type will produce at least as much.

Adding up IC($\underline{\theta }$) and
IC($\bar{\theta}$):$$\begin{aligned}
(t_{hc}+t_{lc})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc} &\geq
&(t_{hc}+t_{lc})-\bar{\theta}q_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{hc}\pause
\\
-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}+\bar{\theta}q_{lc} &\geq &-\underline{\theta }q_{hc}+\bar{\theta}q_{hc} \\
(\bar{\theta}-\underline{\theta })q_{lc} &\geq &(\bar{\theta}-\underline{\theta })q_{hc} \\
q_{lc} &\geq &q_{hc}\end{aligned}$$

### Information rents

The low-cost type must receive a positive surplus – an information rent’
(in an interior, separating contract)

### Proof

<span>Sketch: The low-cost type can always mimic the high-cost type and
earn a surplus ($\Delta \theta q_{hc}$ below) – we need to give her at
least this in order to \`be herself.</span>

$q_{hc},q_{lc}>0$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }u(\bar{\theta},q_{hc})=t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}\geq 0$<span> needed
to satisfy the high-cost type’s PC</span>

$\Longrightarrow $

If low type accepts this (‘lies’), gets

$$\begin{aligned}
u(\underline{\theta },q_{hc}) &=&t_{hc}-\underline{\theta }q_{hc}\pause=\text{ }t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc} \\
\pause &=&u(\bar{\theta},q_{hc})+\Delta \theta q_{hc}>0 \\
\text{{\footnotesize Where}\textit{\ }}\Delta \theta &\equiv &\bar{\theta}-\underline{\theta }\end{aligned}$$

<span>Thus a positive surplus is needed to prevent ‘mimicry,’ i.e.,
</span>$u(\underline{\theta },q_{lc})\geq u(\underline{\theta },q_{hc})>0$

### If P wanted to implement ‘first-best outputs...’

![image](lm_fig_2_4.png)

... it costs more than with full-info; indifference curve goes through
’C’ & B\* $\rightarrow$ rent $\Delta \theta \bar{q}^{\ast}$.

### P’s Optimization Problem (interior, separating)

$$\begin{aligned}
&&\max_{q_{hc},t_{hc},q_{lc},t_{lc}}v[S(q_{lc})-t_{lc}]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc})-t_{hc}]
\\
&&s.t.\text{ }IC(\underline{\theta })\text{, }IC(\bar{\theta})\text{, }PC(\underline{\theta })\text{, and }PC(\bar{\theta})\end{aligned}$$

<span>I.e. (writing this in terms of the net utilities of the
agents)</span> $u_{lc}$ <span>and</span> $u_{hc}$)
$$\max_{(q_{lc},t_{lc}),(q_{hc},t_{hc})}v[S(q_{lc})-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}]-[vu_{lc}+(1-v)u_{hc}]
\notag$$

<span>Subject to</span>

$$\begin{aligned}
u_{lc} &\geq &u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc} \\
u_{hc} &\geq &u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc} \\
u_{lc} &\geq &0 \\
u_{hc} &\geq &0\end{aligned}$$

Write on board:

$$\begin{aligned}
PC(\underline{\theta }) &:&t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}\equiv u_{lc}\geq 0 \\
PC(\bar{\theta}) &:&t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}\equiv u_{hc}\geq 0 \\
IC\underline{(\theta )} &\text{:}&t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}\geq
t_{hc}-\underline{\theta }q_{hc}\text{; } \\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&u_{lc}\geq u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc} \\
IC(\bar{\theta}) &:&t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}\geq t_{lc}-\bar{\theta}q_{lc}
\\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&\text{ }u_{hc}\geq u_{lc}-\Delta \theta
q_{lc}\end{aligned}$$

### Which constraints *do* bind? (Skim in lecture)

<span>...We can thus ‘substitute them in’, and simplify the problem.
</span>

$PC(\bar{\theta})$ <span> is a binding constraint</span>

<span>(by contradiction)</span>

<span>Suppose we have a contract meeting all the constraints, where
</span> $u_{hc}>0$ <span>. Then </span> $P$ <span> could lower </span>
$u_{hc}$ <span>by \`\` </span>$\varepsilon $<span>”, increase </span>$P$
<span>’s expected surplus, and the high-cost type would still
participate.</span>

$PC(\underline{\theta })$ <span>doesn’t bind (information rent)
</span>$P$ <span>could also lower </span>$u_{lc}$<span> by the same
</span>$\varepsilon $$IC(\underline{\theta })$<span> and
IC</span>$(\bar{\theta})$.

$IC(\underline{\theta })$<span> is a binding constraint</span>

<span>(by contradiction) If not</span>, <span>i.e.,</span>
$u_{lc}>u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc}$, $P$<span> could lower
</span>$u_{lc}$<span>, doing better and still satisfying the relevant
constraints: </span>

$IC(\underline{\theta })$<span> would continue to hold if it didn’t bind
before.</span>

$IC(\bar{\theta})$<span> is *relaxed* (*less* incentive for high-cost
type to ‘fake it’).</span>

$PC(\underline{\theta })$<span> would continue to hold because it didn’t
bind before– remember we showed an ‘information rent.’</span>

$PC(\bar{\theta})$ <span> is unaffected.</span>

### Thus:

We know $PC(\bar{\theta})$ and $IC(\underline{\theta})$ bind

$\Longrightarrow$Any optimal contract must have $u_{hc}=0$,

i.e., $t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}=0~$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }t_{hc}=\bar{\theta}q_{hc}$

and $u_{lc}=u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc}$.

i.e., $t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}=0+\Delta \theta q_{hc}$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }t_{lc}=\underline{\theta }q_{lc}+\Delta
\theta q_{hc}$

### Which constraints *do not* bind? (Skip in lecture)

$PC(\underline{\theta})$<span> does not bind (information rent) – so we
can ignore it.  </span>

$IC(\bar{\theta})$<span> is
redundant:</span>$$IC(\bar{\theta}):u_{hc}\geq u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
u_{hc} &=&t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}=0\text{ {\small since} }PC(\bar{\theta}) \text{ {\small binds.}} \\
\text{{\small Recalling }} $u_{lc}=u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc}$ \text{{\small we have}} \\
\pause\u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc} &=&u_{hc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc} \\
\pause u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc} &=&u_{hc}+\Delta \theta (q_{hc}-q_{lc}) \\
= 0+\Delta \theta (q_{hc}-q_{lc})\leq 0 \\
\pause\text{{\small since }}q_{hc} &\leq &q_{lc}\text{ {\small (shown earlier)}} \\
\pause &\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&u_{hc}\geq u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc}\end{aligned}$$

<span>So </span>$IC(\bar{\theta})$<span> holds as a result of the other
constraints, it is redundant. </span>

<span>If </span>$q_{hc}<q_{lc}$<span>, which we will see later, then
</span> $u_{hc}>u_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{lc}$, $IC(\bar{\theta})$
<span>does not ‘bind.’</span>

### Solving...

$\Longrightarrow$<span>Optimization problem:</span>

$$\begin{aligned}
&&\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}E(\Pi ) \\
&=&\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}E(S(q)-t(q)) \\
&=&\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}v\times \lbrack
S(q_{lc})-t_{lc}]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc})-t_{hc}]\text{ } \\
&&\text{{\small s.t. PC \&\ IC constraints}}\end{aligned}$$

$$\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}v[S(q_{lc})-\underline{\theta }\UNDERLINE {q}-\Delta
\theta q_{hc}]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}]$$

$$\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}\Pi =\max_{q_{lc},q_{hc}}~v\times \lbrack S(q_{lc})-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}-\Delta \theta q_{hc}]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}]$$

<span>Given that this is a concave problem, and assuming that the
optimum is interior, the first order conditions are necessary and
sufficient for the optimum:</span>

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \Pi }{\partial q_{lc}} &=&v\times \lbrack S^{\prime }(q_{lc})-\underline{\theta }]=0 \\
\pause &\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&S^{\prime }(q_{lc}^{SB})=\underline{\theta } \\
\pause &\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&q_{lc}^{SB}=q_{lc}^{\ast }\text{...}\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }\text{{\small `efficient lc output'}}\end{aligned}$$

### High-cost type’s output distorted downwards

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \Pi }{\partial q_{hc}} &=&(1-v)[S^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}]-v\Delta \theta =0 \\
\pause S^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{SB}) &=&\bar{\theta}+\frac{v}{(1-v)}\Delta \theta
\text{ ...}\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }q_{hc}^{SB}<q_{hc}^{\ast }\end{aligned}$$

<span>The optimal second-best contract thus offers the low cost type the
first best quantity while it distorts the quantity of the high cost
agent downward to minimize information rents.  </span>

<span>This distortion increases in </span>$\frac{v}{(1-v)}$<span> – the
odds of a low-cost type – and in </span>$\Delta \theta $<span>– the cost
difference. </span>

<span>This also implies </span>$q_{hc}^{SB}<q_{hc}^{\ast }<q_{lc}^{\ast
}=q_{lc}^{SB}$<span> as claimed before, so
</span>$IC(\bar{\theta})$<span> holds with inequality.</span>

### ‘Second-best’ contracts

![image](lm_optimal_secondbest.png)

### But is it worth doing? (Skip in lecture)

Profit:
$$E[\Pi ^{SB}]=v[S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }-\Delta
\theta q_{hc}^{\ast }]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}]$$

<span>There is a cost to inducing </span>$q_{hc}^{SB}$<span> and
</span>$q_{lc}^{SB}>q_{hc}^{SB}$

<span>Fixed (we ignore here) and marginal costs of output </span>

<span>Information rents to low-cost type (</span>$\Delta \theta
q_{hc}^{SB} $)

<span>(Other un-modeled costs, e.g., menu costs, psychological
factors)</span>

### Alternative I – Bunching/pooling:

<span>Maximize s.t. </span>$PC(\bar{\theta})$<span> only, which binds.
</span>

$\Longrightarrow t^{pool}-\bar{\theta}q\equiv u_{hc}^{pool}=0$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow}t^{pool}=\bar{\theta}q$

<span>(Class question: why?)</span>

### Solving pooling case

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{Pool}] &=&S(q^{Pool})-t^{pool}=S(q^{Pool})-\bar{\theta}q^{pool} \\
q^{pool} &=&\max_{q}S(q)-\bar{\theta}q \\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&S^{\prime }(q^{Pool})=\bar{\theta} \\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&q^{pool}=q_{hc}^{\ast } \\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&t^{pool}=\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast } \\
&\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&E[\Pi ^{pool}]=S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast } \\
u_{lc} &=&\Delta \bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }\end{aligned}$$

###

<span>The optimal pooling strategy has both agents producing at the
level that is technically efficient for the high-cost type. </span>

<span>The high cost type will get no surplus, but the low-cost type gets
a rent </span>$\Delta \bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }$.

$\Delta \bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }$<span> versus </span>$\Delta \theta
q_{hc}^{SB}$)!

### Alternative II – ‘Shut down’ high-cost type (or both types)

<span>Note: this resembles the classic “screening” contract; greater
reward for higher effort means the average level of those who will
accept the contract is higher! ... See 156-159 in Milgrom and
Roberts</span>

<span>Maximize s.t. </span>$PC(\underline{\theta })$<span> only, which
binds.  At this contract the high-cost type will not want to
participate.</span>

$\Longrightarrow t^{shut}-\underline{\theta}q^{shut}\equiv u_{lc}
^{shut}=0$

$\mathbf{\Longrightarrow}t^{shut}=\underline{\theta}q^{shut}$

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{shut}] &=&v\times \left( S(q^{shut})-t^{shut}\right) =v\times \left(
S(q^{shut})-\underline{\theta }q^{shut}\right) \\
\pause q^{shut} &=&\max_{q}v\times \left( S(q)-\underline{\theta }q\right)
\notag \\
\pause &\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&S^{\prime }(q^{shut})=\underline{\theta }
\notag \\
\pause &\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&q^{shut}=q_{lc}^{\ast }  \notag \\
\pause &\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&t^{shut}=\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }
\notag \\
\pause &\mathbf{\Longrightarrow }&E[\Pi ^{shut}]=v\times \left(
S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }\right)  \notag\end{aligned}$$

$P$ <span>will get her to produce at her technically efficient level,
and </span>$P$ <span>will take all the rent.</span>

### Caveat: shut-down implied by a negative solution to the previous problem!

<span>Remember the FOC for the high-cost type’s ‘SB’ output:</span>

$$S^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{SB})=\bar{\theta}+[\frac{v}{(1-v)}\Delta \theta \text{ }]$$

###

<span>But if the latter effect is large enough, this may have no
positive solution.  The first unit of the high-cost type’s output may be
too costly in net. </span>

$q_{hc}^{SB}=0$ <span>would be optimal, ‘shutting down’ the high-cost
type.</span>

$q_{hc}^{SB}=0$ <span>will also imply no rent for the low-cost type
(remember, the rent was </span>$\Delta \theta q_{hc}$<span>).</span>

*Thus the ‘shut down’ strategy need not be checked separately in the
continuous differentiable concave case <span>(unless you are asked to do
so)</span>.*

### Comparing alternatives – Interior-separating, pooling, shut-down one, shut down all (Skip in lecture)

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{SB}] &=&v[S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }-\Delta
\theta q_{hc}^{\ast }]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}] \\
E[\Pi ^{Pool}] &=&S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast } \\
E[\Pi ^{shut}] &=&v\left( S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast
}\right) \\
E[\Pi ^{shut~all}] &=&0\end{aligned}$$

###

<span>In general, all of these possibilities should be compared</span>.

<span>In a very general case (although not given the assumptions here),
any of the four could be the optimal one. \[Note, the ‘shut all’ is not
optimal given our assumptions above unless we add a fixed cost
</span>$F$<span> to all the other alternative policies, or have positive
reservation wages; Pooling also will not be optimal here, although it
can if we allow different functional assumptions; see below.\]</span>

<span>Note: These comparisons will be easier to make in a parametric or
numerical case.</span>

###

<span>For example</span>, <span>for </span>$P$ <span>to prefer to have
both types of agent produce different positive output over only having
the low-cost type produce, we require: </span>$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{SB}] &>&E[\Pi ^{shut}]\Longleftrightarrow \\
\pausev[S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }-\Delta \theta
q_{hc}^{\ast }]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}] &>& \\
v\left( S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }\right)
&\Longleftrightarrow & \\
\pause(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}] &>&v\Delta \theta q_{hc}^{\ast
}\end{aligned}$$

<span>I.e., the expected benefit of the high-cost type’s output must
exceed the resulting information rent paid to the low-cost type.</span>

###

$$(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}]>v\Delta \theta q_{hc}^{\ast }$$

<span>The relative advantage of writing a contract that only the
low-cost type will sign increases as:</span>

<span>The difference in costs increases.</span>

<span>Low-cost types become more likely.</span>

<span>The value of additional output decreases.</span>

<span>Comparing the pooling and shutting-down possibilities:</span>

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{shut}] &>&E[\Pi ^{Pool}] \\
\pause
&\Longleftrightarrow &v\left( S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }\right) >\left( S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast
}\right)\end{aligned}$$

<span>The ‘net value’ generated by a low-cost type (weighted by the
probability that a low-cost type is drawn) must exceed the ‘net value’
generated by a high cost type.</span>

$$\begin{aligned}
E[\Pi ^{SB}] &>&E[\Pi ^{pool}] \\
v[S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }-\Delta \theta
q_{hc}^{\ast }]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}]
&>&S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }\end{aligned}$$

$P$ <span>pays a rent to the low-cost type (a larger rent than in the
pooling case), and gets less production from the high-cost type
(‘distortion’). However, </span>$P$ <span>gets a higher output from the
low-cost type under the ‘SB’ contract than under the pooling
contract.</span>

<span>It appears unclear which contract </span>$P$ <span>prefers. It
will depend on the probability of a low-cost type, the relative costs of
the two types, and the value of additional output (the
</span>$S(\cdot )$<span> function). BUT with the conditions as given, we
know pooling on a positive output will never be optimal! \[see next
slide\]</span>

### Proof of no pooling (Skip in lecture)

**Proof by contradiction**

<span>We compared
</span>$v[S(q_{lc}^{\ast })-\underline{\theta }q_{lc}^{\ast }-\Delta \theta q_{hc}^{\ast }]+(1-v)[S(q_{hc}^{SB})-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{SB}]$<span> and
</span>$S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }$<span>, a messy
comparison. But, we need only show that the pooling contract can never
be optimal, i.e.., show that if P is ‘pooling on positive output,’ then
he could do better.</span>

### ...no pooling proof continued

$E[\Pi
^{pool}]=S(q_{hc}^{\ast })-\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }$<span>. But to
this single contract
</span>$\{q_{hc}^{\ast },\bar{\theta}q_{hc}^{\ast }\}$<span>, P could
introduce a second contract </span>$q_{lc}=q_{hc}^{\ast
}+\varepsilon $<span> and reward anyone who takes it an additional
</span>$\underline{\theta }\varepsilon $<span>.  By convention, the
low-cost type will take this contract (because she is indifferent and P
wants her to, as we will see), </span><span>. Thus, P is better off
doing so (note, payoffs will only vary when a low-cost type arises) as
long as </span>$s(q_{hc}^{\ast
}+\varepsilon )-s(q_{hc}^{\ast })>\underline{\theta }\varepsilon $<span> for
some small </span>$\varepsilon $<span>, i.e., as long as
</span>$s^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{\ast })>\underline{\theta }$<span>(as long
as </span>$s^{\prime }$<span> is continuous, as assumed).  </span>

$s^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{\ast })=\bar{\theta}>\underline{\theta }$<span>.
Hence, </span>$s^{\prime }(q_{hc}^{\ast })>\underline{\theta }$<span>,
and the principal can improve on a pooling contract.</span>

### But:

*However*<span>, pooling may be optimal under other functional
assumptions, e.g., if there is a ‘menu cost’ to adding an item on the
contract.</span>

### Overall results (Important!)

$$t_{lc}=\underline{\theta }q_{lc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc};\;\;\;t_{hc}=\bar{\theta}q_{hc}.$$

<span>The efficient type gets a positive information rent, given by
</span>$u_{lc}=\Delta \theta q_{hc}$

  Output distortion of inefficient type:

$$S^{\prime }(q_{hc})=\bar{\theta}+\frac{v}{1-v}\Delta \theta .$$

$q_{lc}=q_{lc}^{FB}$

###

<span>Thus under asymmetric information, the optimal menu of contracts
entails:</span>

<span>No output distortion of the low cost type, thus
</span>$q_{lc}=q_{lc}^{FB}$

<span>Downward output distortion of inefficient type: </span>

$$S^{\prime }(q_{hc})=\bar{\theta}+\frac{v}{1-v}\Delta \theta .$$

<span>‘by making the high-cost agent produce less, and paying him less,
we make his target output less attractive to the low cost agent’</span>

### ...

<span>Only efficient type gets a positive information rent, given
by</span> $u_{lc}=\Delta \theta q_{hc}$<span>.</span>

<span>Second best transfers are given by </span>

$$t_{lc}=\underline{\theta }q_{lc}+\Delta \theta q_{hc};\;\;\;t_{hc}=\bar{\theta}q_{hc}.$$

### Remember:

-   Differences from moral hazard

-   Which agent’s PC constraint binds, and why?

-   Which agent’s IC constraint binds, and why?

-   Which quantity is “distorted” ?

-   What is an “information rent” and who will get one?

-   When does the principal want to meet these constraints (interior,
    separating equilibrium)?
