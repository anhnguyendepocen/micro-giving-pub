# Monopolies and 'allocative inefficiency'

```{block2,  type='note'}

Recall from your previous studies, the model of 'perfect competition':

Free entry and exit - $\rightarrow$ zero long-run economic profit

Many many tiny firms $\rightarrow$ firms are price takers.

$\rightarrow$ price = marginal cost, and in the long run $p=ATC$ and firms produce at $min(AC)$

Similar conditions for input markets (e.g., capital and labor).

This, in combination with firms and consumer's optimizing behavior, and several other assumed conditions (such as diminishing returns to scale) yielded the 'fundamental welfare theorems'. Under the first welfare theorem, free exchange and markets 'in equilibrium' lead to a Pareto-efficient outcome.

These were extreme assumptions; perhaps only a theoretical ideal.

A 'permanent monopoly firm' is the opposite extreme.

```{block2,  type='digression'}

There are a variety of *market structures* we might consider that fall in between the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. These include 'oligopoly' and 'monopolistic competition'. The field of Industrial Organization focuses on these models of market structure  and their implications for pricing, welfare, innovation, and more
