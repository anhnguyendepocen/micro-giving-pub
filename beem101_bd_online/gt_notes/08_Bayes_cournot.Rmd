**Asymmetic Information Cournot**
---------------------------------

**Note:** Watson's text covers a numeric example of this, more general
game.

**Motivation**:
---------------

Two firms choose quantities at the same time.

One firm does not know whether the other firm is high or low cost, both
know their own costs.

Demand is linear, marginal costs are constant

*Q: How would you model this?*

$$\begin{aligned}
P(Q) &=&a-Q=a-q_{1}-q_{2} \\
c_{1}(q_{1}) &=&cq_{1} \\
c_{2}(q_{2}) &=&c_{2}\cdot q_{2} \\
\text{\textit{Where}} &\text{: }& \\
c_{2} &=&C_{H}\text{ with probability }\theta \\
c_{2} &=&C_{L}\text{ with probability }1-\theta\end{aligned}$$

**Players:** Firms 1 and 2

**Actions: **Choose a quantity ($q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$)

Actions by types: $1$ chooses $q_{1}$

Player $2$, type $c_{H}$ chooses $q_{2}(c_{H})$

Player $2$, type $c_{L}$ chooses $q_{2}(c_{L})$

**Payoffs:**
$$\pi _{k}=q_{k}\cdot p(Q)=q_{k}\cdot (a-q_{1}-q_{2}-c_{k})\text{ for }k\in
\{1,2\}$$

**States:** Firm 2's marginal cost $c_{2}\in \{C_{H,}C_{L}\}$ where $%
C_{L}<C_{H}$

**Information structure**

$2$ knows $c_{2}$

$1$ assigns $P(c_{2}=C_{H})=\theta$, $P(c_{2}=C_{L})=1-\theta$

*Note*: In these games, beliefs always correspond to the correct
(correctly computed) probabilities given the information.

**Best Responses**

Note: These will yield a NE strategy profile, a BNE outcome where these
intersect,

Firm 2:

$q_{2}^{\ast }(c_{t})$ solves $$\begin{aligned}
\max_{q_{2}}\text{ }[(a-q_{1}^{\ast }-q_{2})-C_{t}]q_{2}\text{ for }t &\in
&\{H,L\} \\
s.t.\text{ }q_{2} &>&0\end{aligned}$$

*Q: Explain intuitively what firm 1 will do as a 'best response' \...*

*A: Firm 1 will set quantity to optimize its expected profit, knowing
that there is some probability it will face a high-cost competitor, and
some probability it will face a low cost competitor.  The optimal
quantity will be somewhere in between, in this case, in fact the
weighted average of the optimal quantities in each case.*

Firm 1:

$q_{1}^{\ast }$ solves $$\begin{aligned}
&&\max_{q_{1}}\text{ }\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
\theta \lbrack a-q_{1}-q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{H})-c]q_{1}\text{ } \\ 
+(1-\theta )[a-q_{1}-q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{L})-c]q_{1}%
\end{array}%
\right\}  \\
s.t.q_{1} &>&0\end{aligned}$$

*Q: How to solve these for BR's?*

*A: Solve for first order-conditions (set first derivative equal to
zero).  This is a necessary condition for an interior optimum, though
not sufficient. We want the 'choice variable' on the left hand side
only, as a function of the parameters and the other firm's choice.*

FOC's:

$$q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{t})=\frac{a-q_{1}^{\ast }-C_{t}}{2}\text{ for }t=L,H 
\tag{1 \& 2}$$

$$q_{1}^{\ast }=\frac{\theta \lbrack a-q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{H})-c]+(1-\theta
)[a-q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{L})-c]}{2}  \tag{3}$$

**Note***: *This assumes the parameters are such that both quantities
are positive.  Actually, we *do* have to worry about 'corner solutions'
here -- the high cost firm may not produce -- but we ignore this for
now.

*Q: How to solve these for BNE quantities?*

*A: We need to solve this system of equations, substituting one
player-type's optimum into the others to find a 'fixed point.'*

*Q: What will these BNE quantities be a function of?*

*A:They will be a function of the parameters (*$\theta ,c,C_{H},C_{L}$
*).  They will \*not\* be a function of the other player-type's
quantities!*

We solve this by substituting equation 3 ($q_{1}^{\ast }$) into
equations 1 & 2, and then substituting each of these
($q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{L})$ and $%
q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{H})$) into equation 3.  

This yields: $$\begin{aligned}
q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{H}) &=&\frac{a-2C_{H}+C}{3}+\frac{1-\theta }{6}(C_{H}-C_{L})
\\
q_{2}^{\ast }(C_{L}) &=&\frac{a-2C_{L}+C}{3}-\frac{\theta }{6}(C_{H}-C_{L})\end{aligned}$$

*Question: What is interesting about these BNE outcomes (outputs)?*

-   The output for the high-cost type is *higher* than the high-cost
    type's output in the complete information case (i.e., in the case
    where player 1 knew 2's cost).  Remember, this complete information
    output was $q_{i}^{\ast }=\frac{a-2c_{i}+c_{j}}{3}$ where $c_{i}$
    was own and $%
    c_{j}$ was the other firm's cost.

-   Similarly, the output for the low-cost type is *lower* than the
    low-cost type's output in the complete information case.

-   For both types the BNE output involves not only the cost of the
    player's type, but the cost of the player's other type!  Note that
    this was *not* true for the BR functions!  

*Why?*

A: Your optimal output depends not only on your own costs but on your
expectation of the other player's output, and thus on how the other
player will react to what it *thinks* are your costs!  

Firm $2$ will produce less when its costs are high than when they are
low, ceterus paribus.  However, if firm 1 is not sure firm 2's costs are
high, firm $1$ doesn't know how much firm 2 will limit its output and
thus 1 will not increase its output as much as it would if it *knew*
firm 2's costs were high.  Firm 2 knows this, and thus does not limit
its output as much.  This second effect -- the response to firm $1$'s
lack of information, is described by the second additive terms in the
above\...

*Q: What did we forget to compute?*

Firm 1's BNE strategy (action):
$$q_{1}^{\ast }=\frac{a-2c+\theta C_{H}+(1-\theta )C_{L}}{3}$$

Note, this is like a response based on 'average' $c_{2}$, i.e., $\theta
C_{H}+(1-\theta )C_{L}$.  This equivalence does not always hold.
