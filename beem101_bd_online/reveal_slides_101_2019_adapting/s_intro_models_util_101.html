## This module



BEEM101: Microeconomics


- Marks
    - Midterm, 90 minutes 35 marks
    - Final examination, 2 hours: 65 marks

- Classes every fortnight


- Plus research 'coffees' (discussion sessions) in alternate weeks, if you are interested





### Texts and resources  {-#texts} {-}

In previous years I recommended Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50... older editions are fine too). However, you may find this to be  too basic a level, as it's meant for undergraduates. Have a look.

I am now using and recommending several other free online resources instead (or in addition).

Note that this is a 'standard core': any intermediate or advanced textbook in microeconomics will cover most of the same material.

A focal resource:

- [Introduction to
Economic Analysis - MacAffee, Lewis, Dale](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/dale/ieav21.pdf)

A 'no-fluff' text from an esteemed source. Covers much of this module, but  the level varies somewhat throughout. Includes calculus and lots of parametric examples. Lots of great content. Lots of solved problems.

I will also heavily draw on:

- [Quantum Microeconomics](http://www.smallparty.org/yoram/quantum/#downloads); consider the version either with or without calculus
    - An unconventional but very careful and interesting approach; my impression is that it is well organised and explained. You may like it!

- David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/) this will give you a flavor of nearly-PhD-level micro


- [Microeconomics
Markets, Methods & Models
an Open Text
by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine](https://laecon1.lyryx.com/textbooks/OPEN_CURTIS_MIC_1/marketing/CurtisIrvine-Microeconomics-2017A.pdf)
    - A full-fledged text covering many of the topics of this module, without calculus

- [Intermediate microeconomics - M Walbert Illinois tutorials](http://my.ilstu.edu/~mswalber/ECO240/index.html) - click 'tutorials'
    - A series of tutorials for an intermediate microeconomics module. Covers many of the topics of this module. No calculus but a lot of algebra. Lots of supplementary materials too.

##My marks
For the Accelerate end-of-module feedback, you will be asked to rate me.
*All* of these questions are seen as an evaluation of *my performance* specifically.
You will be asked to express an opinion, from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree'
- The lecturer is good at explaining things
- The module is intellectually stimulating
- The lecturer has made the subject interesting
- Any other comments on teaching? (open-ended question)
- Tutorial/Seminar/Workshop staff were good at explaining things
- Tutorials/Seminars/Workshops were well structured and encouraged me to participate
- Any other comments on tutorials? (open-ended)
- I have been able to contact staff when I needed to.
- The module lead valued students' views and opinions about the module
- Any other comments about academic support (open-ended)?
- The criteria used in marking have been made clear in advance
- Feedback on my work has been timely and helpful
- Any other comments on assessment and feedback? (open-ended)
- What opportunities has the module given you to explore ideas or concepts in depth and/or apply what you have learnt?
- To what extent have you engaged with academic research?
- Other comments on learning opportunities? (open-ended)
- Do you have any comments on the learning resources (for example equipment facilities software collections)?
- Any other comments on the module (open-ended)?
(Most important question:)
**Overall I am satisfied with the quality of the module.**
*If at any time you think you don't agree with any of these, please let me know how I can make it better*

## How Economists 'Verify' (or Assess) Theoretical Models
Two methods:
1. Testing Assumptions
<aside class="notes">'Verifying' economic models by examining validity of assumptions upon which models are based.
  Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.? DR: 'Verifying' is a bit too black and white'; all models have limitations.</aside>
<aside class="notes">Adv: The text is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions.
 However, there are many cases in which the *predictions* of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms. \textCR
On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as 'constant relative risk aversion' or 'geometric discounting' can be very credibly tested.
 We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure 'how close' behavior is to the assumption.</aside>
2. Testing Predictions
<aside class="notes">Verifying economic models by asking whether models can accurately predict real-world events.
 If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid. \textCR
DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general.
</aside>
## Positive and normative
*What's the difference between the following two statements?*
1.  "An increase in the minimum wage leads to greater unemployment."
<aside class="notes">Adv: Previous slides had: 'We should increase the minimum wage to help low income workers.'
 Why do I think this is not a good parallel?</aside>
2. 'We should reduce the minimum wage, to lessen unemployment'
- The first is a *positive* statement: it looks at 'what is'
- The second is a *normative* statement: it looks at  'what should be'
<aside class="notes">We will mainly focus on *positive* statements.

 However, you are not forbidden from making normative statements,

 and *positive* results are useful in making *normative* judgements.

 But we should try to be clear which type of statement we are making.

 Still, much economic research has both positive and normative interpretations and implications.

 Some economists work on ways of clearly defining and quantifying preferences over social outcomes.

 Others work on determining determining 'how to optimise', with implications for which policies and decisions

 (for individuals, firms, governments, and nonprofits) will be most efficient and effective at attaining particular goals.</aside>

## App 2.2 : Should Economists care how the mind works?
- Look to biology, psychology, cognitive science for key principles/modeling?
- Evidence of systematic departures from maximization of a consistent and standard utility *function*
    - E.g., treating some prices differently and ignoring information
    - Self-control and 'paying not to go to the gym'
- Should we describe/model *optimizing* behavior or 'typical behavioral patterns'?
    - Arguments for each; see chapter 17 on 'Behavioral Economics'

<p>Adv: this ‘preference for variety’ is thought to hold for most combinations of goods, most of the time, but perhaps not for all pairings.</p>

economists typically like to find results under as general 'weak' conditions as possible,

making the fewest possible assumptions or restrictions.

Still, it can be helpful to use particular functional forms, both for estimation using data,

and for illustrating theoretical insights.

However, it is actually rather difficult to find simple functions that are easy to work with and have nice 'reasonable' properties.</aside>

    - We extend this problem: Continuing this, note $MRS=MU_C/MU_D$ in general, and for this case:
        $$MRS=MU_C/MU_D=\frac{D\frac{1}{2}(CD)^{-1/2}]}{C\frac{1}{2}(CD)^{-1/2}}=D/C$$
