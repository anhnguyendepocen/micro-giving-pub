# Beem101: Project, discussion of research {#project}


```{block2,  type='note'}
**I am filling this in below; I'll let you know when this is finalised (which should be soon).**

## Description from ELE page:

60% of mark: "Final project and presentation"

Several options (to be explained below):  all will ask you to 'explain, assess and apply microeconomic theory'

The project must *not* principally involve material covered in the midterm (and obviously please do not copy content from the lecture materials/web book/textbooks): it must involve Game Theory and/or enrichment/supplemental topics (which may include price-discrimination and/or asymmetric information).


- All projects must include and explain some formal economic modeling (with maths), showing your understanding and insight. In other words, you *must* demonstrate your understanding of Microeconomics and your ability to apply it in some way,

- All projects must cite and explain at least 2 peer-reviewed academic Economics articles (and perhaps more).

- Ideally, these projects will relate to your proposed dissertation (if your programme requires you to do one), or to your career goals

\


- To be submitted by 8 December (this is subject to confirmation)

- Written length: approximately 8-15 pages; for group projects add 5 additional pages to the maximum per additional member of the group, up to 30 pages for a 4 member group.

- If it is submitted as a group project each student must also submit a one-page description of the project and their contribution to it


- Spoken presentation (with slides if desired): 8-10 minutes plus 4-5 minutes discussion and feedback (group presentations may take slightly longer)

- Presentations to be scheduled and take place (online on Teams or in person if health conditions permit) by 11 December or earlier (subject to confirmation)

- For group work, each student must present part of the work to me and respond to at least one question 



## Option 1: Game Theory: Characterization and analysis of a real-world situation/problem/issue

Consider a real-world situation, problem or issue involving strategic interaction.  Characterize and analyse this using the tools of microeconomics and game theory (or principle-agent models and mechanism design.) 

One possible (approximate) structure for this project: 

*Introduction* 
1. State and briefly describe the topic. If possible, briefly explain why it is important, relevant, or interesting (for policy, for business and management, or for considering human behavior, or otherwise).

\

*Model the behaviour/outcome* 

2. Set up the problem (game theory: players, strategies/actions, payoffs, information structure)
3. List your assumptions
4. solve and interpret the model (game theory: define and explain the 'solution concept' you are using)

(Note: you may find it most feasible to construct this by adapting an existing applied model to your particular question. Please reference any work you have adapted, and discuss how you have adapted it.)
\

*Discussion*

6. Discuss the 'results' of the model (any insights, anything that the predictions crucially depend on)

7. (If applicable) What policy can lead to better outcomes? (e.g. increasing/decreasing a key variable, or changing incentive structure)

8. What are some limitations of your model? How may they affect your results?



## Option 2: Asymmetric information/agency theory/mechanism design: Characterization and analysis of a real-world situation/problem/issue

(As in option one, but for a  principle-agent models/mechanisms; this usually implies a 'contracting' situation.)

## Option 3: Application of economic theory to (observational) empirical work (econometric/statistical analysis)

Econometricians collect and use data, and seek to 'identify' particular parameters and relationships, often seeking 'causal inference'.

Consider a *particular* empirical question or policy issue (in Economics or an adjacent area). Conduct a brief survey to identify and characterise the work that has been done in this area. (But please do not go into too much detail in writing about this, if it does not relate to microeconomic theory). You may want to focus on a small number of papers.

Explain how microeconomic theory *influences* the statistical/econometric framing and analysis of this question, and the interpretation of the results. What theoretical models (e.g., of consumer and firm choices, government policy goals, strategic interactions, asymmetric information, institutions and market structures) do they use to 'motivate' their question and justify their empirical econometric approach. Specify and explain these models carefully. Consider how these inform the authors empirical analysis. (E.g., the authors may justify their analysis by stating 'this technique identifies the following parameter under the assumptions of the XXX model'.)

Explain and critique the authors' claims and justifications. If possible, consider the *difference* between the approaches of several authors, contrasting and evaluating their claims and arguments.


(If you like, you can use this as an opportunity to propose and present your *own actual* analysis of data, although this is not necessary).

## Option 4: Comparison of 'Economic experiment' designs (lab or field experiments) guided by Microeconomic theory

Please consider a question or issue in microeconomics that may be addressed through the use of an experiment, whether a laboratory or field experiment. Find several papers that attempt to do this. Explain how their designs reflect economic theory and assumptions, presenting and explaining the relevant economic theory and models. Comparing these papers, discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of their designs in providing evidence on the question of interest. If you like, you may propose and make a case for an alternative experimental design or approach.

## Option 5: Explanation of another 'advanced concept' in Microeconomic theory (not covered in midterm), application to a real-world situation/problem/issue (or a deep theoretical question involving human values and behavior)

In the notes and readings I mention 'enrichment' and 'advanced' concepts. If you choose this option, your project should explore one of these concepts further. For the concept you choose, please present the formal models clearly and explain these 'in your own words'. Discuss the insights these models provide. Discuss the differing approaches and 'controversies' surrounding these models. Provide and explain an example of how this concept applies (and perhaps 'how it has been applied by researchers') to either a  real-world situation/problem/issue, or to a 'deep question informing our understanding of human values and behavior, and aggregate social and market outcomes'.

## Other options:  You can propose another project that doesn't exactly fit into the categories above. BUT ...

If you do so, please do so by early November, and obtain my tentative approval. I want to make sure that all projects achieve the goals of demonstrating your understanding and ability to apply Microeconomics. So be careful.
