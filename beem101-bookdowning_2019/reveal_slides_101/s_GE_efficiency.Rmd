# Additional material on efficiency: key principles

## General equilibrium and efficiency: Coverage

<small> This is a very brief excerpt and summary of the material in NS chapter 10, with some additional motivation. If you understand these slides/notes you don't have to read chapter 10. </small>

## Key principles: efficiency \& 'general' equilibrium

*Under certain conditions* competitive markets are efficient in equilibrium

<br> \bigskip

. . .


But:

- Some markets may not reach equilibrium 'quickly'

. . .

\

- These conditions may not hold $\rightarrow$ *market failure*


. . .

\

- Efficiency itself doesn't imply preferred outcomes: can involve a great deal of inequality

----

*General Equilibrium* (GE) analysis: entire economy as a system of interacting, interdependent markets

- GE: set of prices s.t. $Q_s(P)=Q_d(P)$ in *all* markets, including input markets

<small> Consider: 'partial equilibrium' vs. 'general
 equilibrium analyses.' </small>

 <aside class="notes">E.g., government push for tomato consumption shifts tomato demand out, prices up

this lead to LR shift out in tomato supply curves (firms enter)

increases demand for *inputs* like farm labour, raises cost of production of other veg, etc

Will we return to equilibrium, and with what prices and quantities?

Stay tuned true believers! (and take more Econ, because we won't cover it here) </aside>

Overall efficiency requires several conditions:


Efficiency in production (being on the PPF)
:     No way to reallocate inputs to increase production of one good without reducing production of another


<br> \bigskip



Given society's resources, we are producing 'as much as possible'

Efficiency in production?


----

### Argument: efficiency in production


Specifically, economy produces on the PPF: given available inputs, we produce 'as much as possible'

. . .


- I.e., we can't produce more of any good without producing less of some other good


<br> \bigskip


. . .




$\leftarrow$ Ensured by 'efficient use of inputs' (same 'bang for the buck' per input for all firms and products)



. . .


$\leftarrow$ Ensured by 'competitive market for inputs' (all firms face the same prices, prices set to equalise demand and supply for inputs)


<aside class="notes"><small>Basic argument: firms hire more of each input until its 'bang for buck' is the same as all other inputs,

a single market price for the input will ensure this is the same across firms.

This 'equilibrium' input price must reflect its marginal productivity in producing the 'last unit' for *each and every firm and product*

MRTS(k,l) must be equal across all firms/products, otherwise they would 'trade'


... Can also be seen as ensured through 'exchange between firms' (production Edgeworth box) </small>
</aside>

----



Efficiency in consumption (exchange efficiency)
:     No way to reallocate output amongst consumers to make them all better off


. . .


<br> \bigskip



Given what we're producing, it is going to the 'right consumers'.



<aside class="notes">Basic argument for exchange efficiency of competitive equilibrium:

If, given the 'endowments', one person values A in units B more than someone else,

an equilibrium price ensures that they will trade these amongst one another until each has the same MRS

The 'Edgeworth box' offers a graphical demonstration that this yields a Pareto optimum (given the amounts produced).</aside>

<aside class="notes">More prosaically, a single price for each good ensures that everyone who buys the good

 values their last unit of it the same amount (its price)</aside>

<aside class="notes">Basic argument for exchange efficiency of competitive equilibrium:

An equilibrium price ensures that they will trade these amongst one another until each has the same MRS

----


### Formal conditions and argument for efficiency in consumption (Exchange efficiency)

Specifically: No way to reallocate output amongst consumers to make them all better off


. . .


<br> \bigskip

With DMRS, this is equivalent to 'for the last (positive) unit of X purchased by each consumer, they are all willing to give up the same amount of X to get another Y'


. . .


I.e., their marginal rates of substitution for the last unit they buy are all the same: equal to the price ratio.


<br> \bigskip

. . .


$\leftarrow$ basically ensured by the $MRS(x,y)=p_x/p_y$ 'bang for the buck' condition.

<aside class="notes"> <small> All purchase a good up to the point in which their willingness to trade it off for another good equals the price ratio; thus all have the same relative valuation (MRS) for the 'last unit' of each good. </small>

<small> Edgeworth box shows how this could occur more directly through exchange
the price that leads one guy to want to 'sell A units of X and buy B units of Y',
 and also leads the other guy to want to 'buy A units of X and sell B units of X'
 leads them to both have the same MRS at this 'equilibrium bundle </small></aside>

----

Given our inputs, we can produce 'efficiently', i.e, along the PPF,

<br> \bigskip

and given the amounts of each good produced, it is 'consumed by the right people' (no more room for trade) ...

<br> \bigskip


yet we may still not be at efficiency? `r format_with_col("Why not?","blue")`

We need to produce the right *combination* of goods.

<br> \bigskip
<br> \bigskip

Efficient allocation of resources ('top-level' condition)
:     No way to produce more of one good and less of another to make all consumers better off

<aside class="notes">Basic argument for top-level efficiency of competitive equilibrium:

Equilibrium prices from exchange reflect each consumer's marginal rates of substitution for their last unit

This signals to firms the rate at which *all* consumers would be willing to trade off A for B at the margin

In equilibrium firms produce at a point where the cost tradeoffs between A and B (slope of PPF) reflects these prices.</aside>

----

### Formal conditions/argument for top-level cond.

Efficiency $\leftarrow$ (Along PPF), can't adjust **product mix** to make any consumers better off without making some worse off

. . .

*Formally:*

DMRT on x PPF & DMRS for consumers <small> (rem: all have same MRS) </small>...

$\leftrightarrow MRS(x,y)=MRT(x,y)$

is necessary/sufficient for top-level efficiency


. . .


<small> I.e., marginal tradeoff in production = marginal tradeoff in consumption, i.e., Slope of PPF at chosen point = slope of everyone's indifference curve at their chosen point </small>

. . .


----

Need $$MRS(x,y)=MRT(x,y)$$ for top-level efficiency.

`r format_with_col("Why should the free-market lead to this?", "blue")`

\

Optimizing consumers, free exchange $\rightarrow$ MRS reflects relative prices

. . .

competitive firms choose q's s.t. $mc(q_x)=p_x$ $\forall$ firms, goods

$\rightarrow$ ratios are equal; consumers' value tradeoff equals production tradeoff :)

<aside class="notes">through free exchange, price signals, competition</aside>


----

First fundamental theorem of welfare economics
:     A general competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient, under standard assumptions


<br> \bigskip


- Intuition: free exchange leaves no room for mutually-beneficial improvements, and firms and consumers optimise

----


Second fundamental theorem
:     Under some fancy assumptions, any Pareto efficient outcome is a competitive equilibrium for *some* pattern of initial endowments


. . .

<br> \bigskip

So if we could costlessly redistribute *endowments*, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome by doing so, and then relying on the free market.

----

First fundamental theorem of welfare economics
:     A general competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient, under standard assumptions.

. . .

\

**But these assumptions may not hold $\rightarrow$ 'market failures'**

1. Imperfect Competition

- Markets not competitive, because of barriers to entry or increasing returns to scale

- $\rightarrow$ Prices won't reflect marginal costs $\rightarrow$ 'deadweight losses'


----

2. Externalities, public goods, altruism

Assumptions: 'anything someone values' is bought & sold in the market on their own behalf


. . .

<br> \bigskip

But:

- Externalities: All costs (& benefits) may not be priced; e.g., pollution

- Public goods (and bads): Many benefit from the same good (e.g., fireworks)


. . .


- <small> Also: Altruism/interdependent utilities: People care about *others'* consumption </small>


----

3. Asymmetric information: People have different information about the state of the world (costs, risks, a good's quality...)


<br> \bigskip


. . .


4. Bounded rationality: people may not choose in their own best interests


----

**Second Welfare theorem**

If we could costlessly redistribute *endowments*, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome

by redistributing and then relying on the free market

<br> \bigskip


But:


. . .


- Redistribution via 'optimal lump-sum' taxes isn't easy, as endowments may be unobservable


- and redistribution based on things you can affect, e.g. income, may distort incentives.


# Notes on supplementary reading

*2019: this is not neccesary the midterm, but could be relevant to the final*

## Supplementary reading:

- Slonim, Robert, Carmen Wang, and Ellen Garbarino. "The market for blood." The Journal of Economic Perspectives 28.2 (2014): 177-196.

----

## Key points:

An unusual 'market' (or non-market)

- Altruism, repugnance, asymmetric information about disease

- Limited storage of blood

. . .


- Many countries have *volunteer* supply, so no 'price' to donate
    - Volunteer behavior responds to entirely different motivations! Not guided by demand.
- $\rightarrow$  How efficient can it be?


----

>  imbalances between aggregate supply and demand are a major challenge in blood markets, including excess supply after disasters and insufficient supply at other times.

. . .


> not unexpected given that the blood market operates without market prices and with limited storage length (about six weeks) for whole blood.


. . .


> Yet shifting to a system of paying blood donors seems a practical impossibility given attitudes toward paying blood donors and concerns that a paid system could compromise blood safety.

----

- Large variation in systems across countries (volunteer versus paid and family/friend donors)

. . .

- Historical shifts:
    - Paid 'blood on the hoof', markets needed immediate matching
    - Better storage, blood banking, impersonal diffuse markets
    - WWII: Patriotism, voluntary donations
    - AIDS crisis

----

Issues with paying donors

- Does it crowd out intrinsic motivation?

. . .

- Does it bring moral hazard and 'select' the wrong, unsafe donors?


. . .

- Is it harmful to the donors (paternalistic idea)

- or otherwise 'repugnant'?


----

Issues with volunteer supply

- Not adequate in many countries


. . .

- Responds to other motivations than actual need, as there is no price

    - Donate more after disasters like 9-11 even where need is *not* high

    - But agencies don't want to turn away donors ('ungrateful', signal 'never need blood')


----

### Suggestions for improvements to blood market

- Techniques for boosting donations


    - Mandate choice

    - Symbolic and reputational rewards, gift exchange


. . .


- Clearinghouse, donor registry, invitations
