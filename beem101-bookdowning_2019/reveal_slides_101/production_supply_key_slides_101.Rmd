# The Firm's Production function
## The Firm's Production function


$$q = f( K, L, M, ...)$$


$$q = f(K, L)$$

---- 

e.g., 'Cobb douglas with particular proportions and constant returns to scale'

$$q =2L^{1/3}K^{2/3}$$

\

or 'Leonteif'

$$y=min\{a_1 x_1, a_2 x_2, ...a_n x_n \}$$
. . .

Or 'two-input Constant Elasticity of Substitution':

$$x_1^\rho + x_2^\rho)^(1/\rho)$$

\

## Marginal product of each input


> Additional output from adding +1 unit of an input, holding other inputs constant.


>  Marginal Product of Labour---$MP_L$: Slope of production function in units of labour (holding capital etc constant)


. . .

$$MP_L=\frac{\partial}{\partial L}f(K,L)$$

\

E.g., for $q = f(K,L) = 2L^{1/3}K^{2/3}$ ... $MP_L(K,L) =$ ?

\ Check, does this production function have 'diminishing marginal product of labour'?

## Marginal rate of technical substitution


'Rate you can trade off input for another holding production constant'

$$RTS(K,L) = MP_L/MP_K$$

E.g., for $q = f(K,L) = L^{1/3}K^{2/3}$ ...
$MP_L(K,L) =\frac{2}{3} L^{-\frac{2}{3}} K^\frac{2}{3}$ 
$MP_K(K,L) =\frac{4}{3} L^{\frac{1}{3}} K{^-\frac{1}{3}}$ 

$MP_L/MP_K = \frac{1}{2} K/L$

<small> See also 'elasticity of substitution' </small>

## Returns to scale

> The rate at which output increases in response to a proportional increase in *all* inputs.

\

$$f(\mathbf{tx}) \text{ versus } tf(\mathbf{x})$$


<center> <small> 'Global' or 'local' increasing/decreasing/constant returns to scale; also see 'elasticity of scale' </small> </center>


--- 

**Computing...** *If you know the production function, how do you know if the 'returns to scale' are increasing or decreasing?*


> Slide in a constant $\alpha>1$ next to each input, simplify, and compare to the original production

. . .

E.g.:

$$Q(L,K) = L^{1/4}K^{1/2}$$

. . .

$$Q(\alpha L, \alpha K) = (\alpha L)^{1/4}(\alpha K)^{1/2}$$
$$=\alpha^{1/4}\alpha^{1/2}L^{1/4}K^{1/2}=\alpha^{3/4}L^{1/4}K^{1/2}=\alpha^{3/4}Q(L,K)$$

\

<small> $\rightarrow$  So if we increase inputs by $\alpha$ here, we increase output by $\alpha^{3/4}<\alpha$, so DRS *everywhere* for this production function. </small>

<aside class="notes">
Note that this case was easy;  returns to scale may not be constant: there can be IRS at one point and CRS or DRS at another.
You can always just try doubling everything and see if output doubles but this will only tell you the returns to scale in this particular range.

# Cost minimizing input choice

## Cost minimizing input choice

*Formally a cost function':*

$$c(\mathbf{w},y) \equiv \min_{\mathbf{x}\in R^n_+}(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x}) \text{ s.t. } f(\mathbf{x}) \geq y $$

For input price vector $\mathbf{w>>0}$ and output $y$. 


Lagrangian optimisation w interior solution $\mathbf{x}^*>>0$ $\rightarrow$ 
there is some $\lambda^*\in R$ s.t. 

$w_i = \lambda \frac{\partial f(\mathbf{x}^*)}{\partial x_i} \forall i$

$\rightarrow  \frac{\partial f(\mathbf{x}^*)}{\partial x_i}/\frac{\partial f(\mathbf{x}^*)}{\partial x_j} = \frac{w_i}{w_j} \forall i,j$ 


----

I.e., where input mix optimal, each input that is used yields same *marginal product per Â£*

<aside class="notes">
<small> very similar to the consumer optimization we discussed. For a given total input cost, the firm wants to produce as much as possible. A better way of thinking about this is that for a given production, the firm wants to incur as low a cost as possible. However, there is no 'hard budget constraint' as in the consumer optimisation case. The firm's output choice will be chosen to maximise it's profit, with no constraints other than 'non-negativity'. </small>

Consider a combo of K and L, and the output this yields.

\

. . .

From here, firm can 'substitute capital for labour' at rate $RTS(K,L)= MP_L/MP_K$
 (& hold production constant)

\

. . .


If firm uses both K & L and chooses optimally $\rightarrow$

Set $RTS(K,L)$ equal to the input price ratio of these inputs ($w/r$)

. . .

\


$\rightarrow$ 'Same bang for the buck at optimal choices $K^*$ and $L^*$' i.e.,

\

$$\frac{MP_K(K^*,L^*)}{r}= \frac{MP_L(K^*,L^*)}{w}$$

<aside class="notes">
Intuition:  At optimum, \pounds1 more spent on labour must produce as much as \pounds 1 more on capital. Otherwise I'm not optimising, and I should reallocate.

----

*Aside, for intuition and story-telling*


\

If markets for labour and capital are *(perfectly) competitive* prices of inputs & outputs adjust so that:

-  'bang for the buck' (in revenue) is *the same for all inputs and for all production processes*

- Inputs (workers, owners of capital) in *every industry* will be paid based on their (marginal) productivity ...

<aside class="notes">
E.g, if workers were being paid less than their marginal productivity, they would be 'hired away' by another producer, ultimately raising wages until these equal the marginal productivity, the marginal contribution to revenue

Todo: give more explanation here

## Advanced question

Back to our 'replaced by AI' motivation, a simple model. Suppose:

\

One product in the economy with 'constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas production function:'

$$q = L^{a}K^{1-a}$$

\

<small> This implies 'optimising firms will spend a share $\alpha$ on labour'. </small>

. . .

\


<center> <small> `r format_with_col("Now suppose technological changes imply $a$ decreases.  What do you think will happen to wage rates, presuming a 'fixed supply of labour'?", "blue")` </small>  <center>

## Summing up

**Summing up**: Optimisation (given a production function and input prices)...

yields a (minimum) cost for every output $q$ a firm chooses to produce.

\

<center> $\rightarrow$ We will be able to construct a *cost function* </center>




# Returns to scale

## Returns to scale

*Are bigger firms always more efficient? Do things get cheaper to produce the more we produce?*

<aside class="notes">If so, what limits the size of firms? I.e., why don't we see only one firm in each industry?</aside>

. . .

Returns to scale
:     The rate at which output increases in response to a proportional increase in *all* inputs.


----

Constant returns to scale (CRS)
:     If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor equal to X.

<small> E.g., doubling all inputs (labor, capital, land, etc) means exactly doubling all outputs </small>


. . .


\

\medskip

Increasing returns to scale (IRS)
:     If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor greater than X.


. . .

\


Decreasing returns to scale (DRS)
:     If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor less than X.


----


### Arguments/reasons for scale (dis)economies

**IRS**

- Fixed costs (incorporation, buildings, management, planning, R&D) spread over more units

- Should always be able to at least 'double everything' and produce twice as much? (so at least CRS)

- Scale allows specialisation

. . .

\
<br> \bigskip

----


**Arguments for DRS**

- Limited resources in (relevant) economy; costs begin to rise
- Managerial issues and coordination problems, bigger 'centre' to lobby for favours.  `r format_with_col("See 'theories of the firm'","gray")`
- Harder to give incentives to top manager/CEO?

<aside class="notes">Adv: I think the first point is valid,

 but it doesn't suggest that 2 firms would be more efficient than 1;

these DRS would set in as a function of  *total* output, not a single firm's output.

 The second and third arguments are complicated and perhaps harder to justify.

 The case for DRS is unproven, IMHO</aside>

# Costs {#costs}


## Types of costs ('Basic cost concepts')

**Fixed costs (FC):** Costs that must be regularly incurred to *remain* in business (i.e., for any level of output), but that do not vary with the level of output

\

**Variable costs (VC):** Costs that increase with the quantity produced.

\

. . .


**Sunk costs**:     Costs that have been incurred in the past that can never be recovered.

Sunk costs should not enter into *any* economic decisions.


<small> *FC from previous years are sunk costs; FC for future years are not.* </small>



# Again: Economic profits and cost minimisation; 2-input model

## Again: Economic profits and cost minimisation

## 2-input model

- Labour costs - wage rates $w$
- Capital costs - rental rate $v$


. . .

Total costs $= TC = wL + vK$

. . .


Economic profit = $\pi$ = Total Revenues - Total Costs

. . .


$$\pi = Pq-wL-vK = P\times f(K,L)-wL-vK$$

(P: price of good)



##  Cost minimizing input choice, expansion path, ratio condition

Choose point where RTS = ratio of input prices

- RTS = (wage rate/rental rate) = w/v
- Same ratio of 'marginal productivity/price' for each input used

<aside class="notes">Again, this is very much like the consumer case. Recall the consumer set the MRS equal to the price ratio

The 'benefit tradeoff' must equal the 'price tradeoff' in both cases, otherwise we are not optimizing.</aside>

# Average and marginal cost curves 

## Read at home:

- Average and marginal cost curves

- ... with differing returns to scale: Increasing, decreasing, constant, optimal scale


. . .


<br> \bigskip

Skip: "Short and long run" costs for the firm


----

Average cost
:     Cost per unit of output


$$AC=TC/q$$

- TC = 'summed' marginal costs and fixed costs
- AC: 'average marginal cost' + FC/q


<aside class="notes">The total 'rise over run' for the TC curve at a given quantity as the firm optimally chooses its inputs along the expansion path</aside>


. . .

\

Marginal cost
:     Incremental cost of last unit produced

- I.e., additional cost of producing one more unit of output
- MC: Slope of (optimising) TC curve at a point

----

Shape of marginal cost curve depends on production function

- Constant returns to scale: constant MC (and no FC)

- Decreasing returns to scale: increasing MC

- Increasing returns to scale: decreasing MC (and/or constant FC)
