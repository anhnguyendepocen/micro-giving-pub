# Outline and description:  The first chunk aims to cover:

1. Explain what this module is about and how to get the most out of it
2. Explain what Microeconomics is about and why it is useful
3. Explain what the point of 'models' are
4. Mention some *applications* of these
5. Recap some examples of microeconomic models and questions (should be largely revision)
    - Get your econ brain flowing
6. Discuss 'empirical work' in Microeconomics, and how it connects to 'theory'

## This module



BEEM101: Microeconomics


- Marks
    - Midterm, 90 minutes 35 marks
    - Final examination, 2 hours: 65 marks

- Classes every fortnight


- Plus research 'coffees' (discussion sessions) in alternate weeks, if you are interested





### Texts and resources  {-#texts} {-}

In previous years I recommended Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50... older editions are fine too). However, you may find this to be  too basic a level, as it's meant for undergraduates. Have a look.

I am now using and recommending several other free online resources instead (or in addition).

Note that this is a 'standard core': any intermediate or advanced textbook in microeconomics will cover most of the same material.

A focal resource:

- [Introduction to
Economic Analysis - MacAffee, Lewis, Dale](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/dale/ieav21.pdf)

A 'no-fluff' text from an esteemed source. Covers much of this module, but  the level varies somewhat throughout. Includes calculus and lots of parametric examples. Lots of great content. Lots of solved problems.

I will also heavily draw on:

- [Quantum Microeconomics](http://www.smallparty.org/yoram/quantum/#downloads); consider the version either with or without calculus
    - An unconventional but very careful and interesting approach; my impression is that it is well organised and explained. You may like it!

- David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/) this will give you a flavor of nearly-PhD-level micro


- [Microeconomics
Markets, Methods & Models
an Open Text
by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine](https://laecon1.lyryx.com/textbooks/OPEN_CURTIS_MIC_1/marketing/CurtisIrvine-Microeconomics-2017A.pdf)
    - A full-fledged text covering many of the topics of this module, without calculus

- [Intermediate microeconomics - M Walbert Illinois tutorials](http://my.ilstu.edu/~mswalber/ECO240/index.html) - click 'tutorials'
    - A series of tutorials for an intermediate microeconomics module. Covers many of the topics of this module. No calculus but a lot of algebra. Lots of supplementary materials too.

<aside class="notes">is similar to our text, but with more maths and formalism, and some extensions (but fewer applications)</aside>

1. Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extension (also by Nicholson and Snyder): more maths and extensions

2. David Autor's MIT Open Courseware "Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy": More rigorous, close to PhD level, includes good research applications; we'll be drawing from it


3. PhD level: Jehle and Reny's "Advanced Microeconomic Theory", or  Hal Varian's text "Microeconomic Analysis"; Mas-Colell et al for wizards only

<aside class="notes">You will have seen many of these concepts before.

But do you really understand them well enough to *explain* them to a non-economist

### What is Economics?

\

\note{DR: It has changed. There are different views.}

> 'Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.'

\

<!-- \pause -->

> 'Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.' Alfred Marshall

<aside class="notes">The first quote suggests an *approach*, the second suggests a *domain*.</aside>
<aside class="notes">'Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.' Ludwig von Mises</aside>
 <aside class="notes">Asked two economists and will probably get at least three answers</aside>

----

### What is Microeconomics?


\


The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets.

<!-- . . . -->


\

<br> \bigskip

Largely, using theoretical and mathematical 'models' that depend on strong assumptions.


<aside class="notes">Give some examples of economic choices: Consumer purchases, investments, life and family choices, taking a job,

starting a firm, entering a market, producing a product (type, quality, inputs), pricing it...</aside>

<center>
<big> Models are general, and can be applied to many contexts; deep meanings </big> </center>

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/karl_pilkington_by_kevandre-d8z0zzh.png")
```

<aside class="notes">Are models 'fully realistic'? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications.

 A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and 'general';

 some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed.

 But even these more general models are simplifications</aside>



#  So why learn these models?

What do models give us?

<br> \bigskip

*`r format_with_col("There are different views of this","blue")`*

<br> \bigskip

<!-- . . . -->


Assumptions $\rightarrow$ Results \


<!-- . . . -->

and sometimes $\rightarrow$ testable predictions (if the assumptions hold)

<br> \bigskip

<aside class="notes">Adv: You can critique only the assumptions;

the results are logically/mathematically proven

  although when the results contradict real-world evidence this hints that the assumptions may be substantially wrong.

Do these simplified models yield conclusions that are relevant to the more complicated real world?

Maybe, and sometimes. We will consider the evidence </aside>


----


**So why learn these models?**

- A starting point

- (Sometimes) make testable concrete predictions

- Building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking


<!-- \pause -->

- Discussion is framed around them; seen as a 'baseline'

- Understand the models to effectively critique or extend them



<aside class="notes">Some critics of 'neoliberal economics' can be misinformed about what it is.

Their criticism sounds to us like someone who says 'cars are dangerous and should be banned

 because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping'</aside>


----

**Differing views** on the use of economic models

*Instrumentalist:*


The Methodology of Positive Economics (Friedman): the ultimate goal of theory is to "yield valid and meaningful ... predictions about phenomena not yet observed"

----

<!-- . . . -->


'Fictionalist' (Sugden):

> describes a fictional world that is credible or truthlike in something like the way that the events of a realistic novel are;
> the model connects with the real world by relations of similarity



----

Are these models predictive?

<br> \bigskip

If not, are they useful?

<aside class="notes">Reasons to model optimising behavior if it is not predictive.

 But good evidence for optimisation and 'predictable irrationality' ... behavioural economics.</aside>

<aside class="notes">
-e.g., :
    - psychological costs/benefits relating to *outcomes other than their own final consumption.*

    - They may care about others' consumption (altruism etc.),

    - about the way they *make* the decision,

    - and about how close they come to certain goals ('reference points' and 'loss aversion').

    -  may realize their  short-term choices are not in their lt interest, and try to constrain themselves

    - mentally costly to carefully calculate the costs and benefits $\rightarrow$  'rational inattention'

    -follow simple rules or 'heuristics' to make their decisions easier; e.g., 'work every day until I've earned  target income'.

# Does (elite) higher education increase (individual) income/social welfare? Do the gains outweigh the (opportunity) costs?

<small> Application 1.2 in NS text. Handout: some articles discussing this. Read at home, discuss </small>

<aside class="notes">

The answer to this question depends on Microeconomic concepts such as

- Returns to labour inputs in (competitive?) markets; human capital

- The role of skilled labor in the production function

- Asymmetric information over employee 'type' and 'signaling'

- Intertemporal substitution of consumption and 'discount rates'

Even framing the question requires microeconomics.

Consider: Social vs private returns. Is there a case for 'market failure' in the provision of education?

- Who gains and who suffers with a government-imposed price floor/ceiling?

<aside class="notes">
To economists, a 'shortage' is where, at the prevailing or imposed price,

consumers are willing to buy more than is available.

Some consumers get value from the good in excess of the price.

They might offer a higher price, or sellers might ask for a higher price.

The price rise would reduce quantity demanded (not 'reduce demand')

 and increase quantity supplied (not 'reduce supply').

<!---
## How Economists 'Verify' (or Assess) Theoretical Models
Two methods:
1. Testing Assumptions
<aside class="notes">'Verifying' economic models by examining validity of assumptions upon which models are based.
  Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.? DR: 'Verifying' is a bit too black and white'; all models have limitations.</aside>
<aside class="notes">Adv: The text is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions.
 However, there are many cases in which the *predictions* of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms. \textCR
On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as 'constant relative risk aversion' or 'geometric discounting' can be very credibly tested.
 We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure 'how close' behavior is to the assumption.</aside>
2. Testing Predictions
<aside class="notes">Verifying economic models by asking whether models can accurately predict real-world events.
 If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid. \textCR
DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general.
</aside>
## Positive and normative
*What's the difference between the following two statements?*
1.  "An increase in the minimum wage leads to greater unemployment."
<aside class="notes">Adv: Previous slides had: 'We should increase the minimum wage to help low income workers.'
 Why do I think this is not a good parallel?</aside>
2. 'We should reduce the minimum wage, to lessen unemployment'
- The first is a *positive* statement: it looks at 'what is'
- The second is a *normative* statement: it looks at  'what should be'
<aside class="notes">We will mainly focus on *positive* statements.

 However, you are not forbidden from making normative statements,

 and *positive* results are useful in making *normative* judgements.

 But we should try to be clear which type of statement we are making.

 Still, much economic research has both positive and normative interpretations and implications.

 Some economists work on ways of clearly defining and quantifying preferences over social outcomes.

 Others work on determining determining 'how to optimise', with implications for which policies and decisions

 (for individuals, firms, governments, and nonprofits) will be most efficient and effective at attaining particular goals.</aside>

A *very* good resource -- Khan academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/

- E.g., see their Introduction to differential calculus


##Simple stuff


(Univariate) Function
:     A 'map' from one or more *variables* $x$ to an outcome $y=f(x)$

- for each value of $x$ the function tells you a single value of $f(x)$; typically we assign $y=f(x)$

\

<aside class="notes">'Variables' are more formally called the 'arguments' of a function </aside>
<aside class="notes">LC: Put up and plot the function $f(x)=-10 +3x$ here.

e.g., if I fish for x hours in a day, how much money do I earn (consider a 10 pound license fee)</aside>


----

\

Linear function
:     A function of the form $y=a+bX$; e.g., $y = f(x) = -10 + 3x$

- Plotted as a straight line; intercept $a$, constant slope $b$

<aside class="notes">Adv, Maths: For linear functions $f(a X_1 + b X_2) = a f(X_1) + b f(X_2) $ for any values of $a$, $b$, $X_1$, and $X_2$

In particular 'the function of the average is the average of the functions'.

This does *not* hold in general for nonlinear functions</aside>


----


Slope of $y = f(x)$
:      The change in y for a given change in x.  'Rise over run' $(\Delta y / \Delta x)$.


<br> \bigskip

<!-- \pause -->

- Arc slope, point slopes

<aside class="notes">Arc slope is the slope over a range.

Point slope: slope of the tangent to a curve at a point

For linear functions these are the same</aside>

----

Nonlinear (univariate) function
            : A function $f(x)$ of a form other than $f(x) = y=a+bX$;


<!-- . . . -->


- E.g., a quadratic function $y = f(x) = a + bx + cx^2$
    - E,g, $y = f(x) = 10 - 2x + 3x^2$
- Or a logarithmic $y=ln(x)$ or exponential function $y = exp(x)$

<aside class="notes">I will try to limit things to linear and quadratic functions, and possibly exponential and log function</aside>
<aside class="notes">I will remind you of the rules for dealing with these whenever it is necessary.</aside>


----


For linear functions the slope is the same at any point. For nonlinear functions it may differ at each point.

Instantaneous rate of change (instantaneous slope)
:    The slope of the line *tangent* to the curve at a single point

<aside class="notes">Adv, Math: This is the limit of the 'rise over run' as the run goes to zero</aside>


<!-- . . . -->


- Convex function: Slope everywhere increasing, unique minimum where slope $=0$
- Concave function: Slope everywhere decreasing, unique *maximum* where slope $=0$

<aside class="notes">Quadratics are convex if the squared term has a positive sign ... dominates at large x</aside>


<aside class="notes">We will mainly deal with functions like these,

 with a single minimum or maximum that occurs at the unique point with slope zero. </aside>

<aside class="notes">Ex convex: Tiger's golf earnings per game as function of hours of golf retraining

Or cost per smoothie as function of employees behind smoothie counter.

Ex concave: how funny I am as function of beers I drink</aside>


----

Derivative of a function
:     A *derivative* of a function $f(x)$ is another function called $f'(x)$.
$f'(x)$ tells us the (point) *slope* of the function $f(x)$ at any point $x$.


<!-- . . . -->


- For example, the derivative of the function $f(x) = 2x + 3$ is $f'(x) = 2$
    - For this linear function the slope is a constant, 2

----

- E.g., the derivative of the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1$ is $f'(x) = 2x - 4$

<br> \bigskip

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

----

- derivative of the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1$ is $f'(x) = 2x - 4$

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/plotaquadfncn_andderiv.png")
```



<!-- . . . -->


- E.g., the slope at $x=1$ is $f'(x;x=1) = 1*1 - 4 = -2

- The slope is zero where $f'(x)=2x-4=0$, or where $x=2$

    - *Is $x=2$ at a min, a max, or neither? How do we know?*

 You don't have to memorise the rules for this module; I will always tell you the derivative when you might need it.</aside>
<aside class="notes">LC: Plot 'slope of function' with same X-axis as function itself</aside>


## Minimum, maximum, or neither?

- $f'(x)$ is a function that tells us the slope of $f(x)$, or how $f(x)$ changes in $x$ at any point $x$
- In turn, the derivative of $f'(x)$ is called $f''(x)$.
    - Tells us how the *slope* changes as $x$ increases

Oversimplifying:

<aside class="notes">Adv, Math: Essentially, for a class of functions where the domain is not bounded</aside>

## Functions of two or more variables (multivariate functions)

Utility, profit, cost, production, returns, etc.

- May depend on multiple variables/inputs
- Need to illustrate tradeoffs between these


<!-- . . . -->

$$y=f(x,z)$$

- $y$ may increase and/or decrease in $x$ and in $z$,

- The rate of increase of y in $x$ may depend on the values of $x$ and $z$

     - Similar for the rate of increase of y in z


<!-- . . . -->

E.g., $$y=\sqrt(xz) = x^{1/2}z^{1/2}, x \geq 0, z \geq 0$$

## Contour lines (we will come back to this later!)

Contour lines
:     Level sets - depict combinations of variables that hold the function constant at a particular value
:     f(x,z) = A for some value $A$

Level sets: *E.g., indifference curves*, *isoquants* and *isocost* curves.

- $W$:  an external or *exogenous* variable that increases the quantity demanded (at any price)

<aside class="notes">E.g., the amount of a windfall tax rebate, boosting net income</aside>

- $Z$:  an *exogenous* variable that makes production more costly
<aside class="notes">increasing the price firms require to supply a particular quantity</aside>
<aside class="notes">E.g., the level of the minimum wage, or e.g., energy prices</aside>

\

<!-- . . . -->

Now write the supply/demand model as:
$$Q=-P+W$$
$$P=Q+Z$$

- P and Q are *endogenous* variables, so don't ask 'how does P change in Q?'
- W and Z are *exogenous* variables
    - If we know W and Z we can solve for the equilibrium Q and P
    - 'Comparative statics': how equilibrium responds to shifts in W \& Z

*Why did price rise to US\$130 in 2008 and fall to \$50 by March '09?*

<!-- . . . -->

- China \& India's economies grew $\rightarrow$ growth in the world economy by 3-4\% per year
    - (Various calculations) $\rightarrow$ Demand shifts out from  $Q_D = 85 - 0.4P$ to:

<aside class="notes">I think the 'new demand' curve comes from an approximation:

if the world economy grew at 4\% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it's previous size. ... thus the growth is $1.047^7=1.316$.

They assume oil's demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112.

Note that the NS text has a typo: equation 3 on page 40, the new demand, should read $Q=112-0.4P$.</aside>

## Motivation (preamble)

Consider a decision you recently made?

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

<aside class="notes">What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the same decision?

If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same situation again. Do you think you'd make the same decision?</aside>

'State a rule that governs (determines/characterizes) how people *do* make decisions'...

I want this rule to be...

1. Informative (it rules *out* at least some sets of choices)

2. Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule)

Similar question:

'State a rule that governs how people *should* make decisions'..

 <br> \bigskip

By 'should' I mean that *they will not regret having made decisions in this way.*

# Utility

Utility
:     "The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity."

<!-- . . . -->

<br> \bigskip

:     Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions

<aside class="notes">Adv: There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv: A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated,

  thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, 'utility', which is maximised</aside>

----

*How is this used?*

<br> \bigskip

<!-- . . . -->


> - Utility will be expressed as a single number that arises from the combination of all goods and services consumed.

<!-- . . . -->


<br> \bigskip


>  Essentially, economists assume that `when making a choice among all available and feasible options, an individual will choose the one that yields the greatest *utility*'


## Utility from two goods

$$Utility = U(X,Y; other)$$


\


<!-- . . . -->


- Leisure and 'goods consumption'
- Food and non-food
- Coffee and tea (holding all else constant)




## Measuring and comparing utilities

<aside class="notes">Adv: This is a difficult but well-studied issue, as it is important for methodology and welfare analysis.


 In more detailed discussions, we might speak of 'cardinal utility', 'ordinal utility', etc.,

 to indicate ways we can compare utility between individuals and in response to policy changes.</aside>

Utility is not 'observable and measurable in utils'

<!-- \pause -->

(Unlike midi-chlorians or thetans)


<br> \bigskip

<!-- \pause -->

> - Utility is seen to govern an individual's *choices* and thus it's only inferred indirectly, from the *choices* people make

----

**Revealed preference:** if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a dog was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/alscat.jpg")
```

----


*Interpersonal comparisons are difficult*


- Who gets 'more' utility?


<br> \bigskip


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/facepalmstatue.jpg")
```

----

*...Interpersonal comparisons are difficult*

- Transfer from Al to Betty: Is the reduction in Al's utility more or less than the increase in Betty's?


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/babytakingfood.JPG")
```

As we only get at utility through an *individual's* decisions, we have no reliable way to compare it across individuals</aside>

<aside class="notes">However, there is work done in the field of public choice trying either to build this up from *axioms* (e.g., the veil of ignorance),
or by eliciting people's preferences over distributions through interesting surveys, experiments, and voting behavior.

</aside>


----

Standard utility functions are only 'identified' (only make distinct predictions) 'up to a monotonic transformation'

- i.e., a 'rank preserving' transformation.

-  E.g., multiply by a positive number, log, square, add/subtract from it;

    - the new utility function makes the same predictions; this is not helpful, because it means we cannot distinguish these empirically!


<!-- . . . -->


> - The "benefit": we can transform (e.g., log) a utility function for convenient calculation


<!-- . . . -->

> - When we deal with uncertain choices, the 'Von Neumann - Morgenstern' utility functions will be somewhat more restrictive and thus better identified.

<aside class="notes">If you believe people obey those axioms and are thus EU maximisers</aside>

<aside class="notes">The Autor reading refers to Cardinal versus Ordinal utility.

 We use the latter in demand/consumer theory.</aside>



# Standard assumptions about preferences ('axioms')



1. Completeness

<aside class="notes">Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive.</aside>

<aside class="notes">The more formal and parsimonious definition (Autor readings, Jehle/Reny) develop this from a single relation 'weakly preferred to'.</aside>

2. Transitivity (internal consistency)

<aside class="notes">If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.</aside>


3. More is Better (*nonsatiation, or some variant of this*)


<aside class="notes">Completeness and transitivity (and continuity)  are necessary for people's choices to be represented by (continuous) *utility functions*

Continuity is necessary for 'well behaved' (not-jumpy) demand curves

(Local) Nonsatiation will help us derive results</aside>


----

### 1. Completeness

Forbidden: "I can't choose between a ski holiday and a beach holiday, but I am not indifferent"

 This is why goods are called ''goods''; individuals prefer having more of any good rather than less.

  Combinations of X and Y in the lightly shaded area are inferior to the combination X\*, Y\*,

 whereas those in the questionable areas may or may not be superior to X\*, Y\*.</aside>



# Who cares?

<br> \bigskip

**If people obey the first two assumptions (axioms),$^\ast$
they will make choices in a way consistent with maximising a (continuous) *utility* function**

<br> \bigskip


*($\ast$ and also 'continuity')



<aside class="notes">silly to say people *actually* consult a utility function.

instead 'people behave as if they are maximizing utility functions';


 similar to  "people choose based on preferences that satisfy the above assumptions. </aside>

<aside class="notes">Axioms stand directly behind 'revealed preference' methods for measuring how much people value

nonmarket goods, like clean air and national parks.

Also gives a vocabulary and a way to test for violations of this consistency, and make alternate predictions</aside>


----

Continuity and nonsatiation

<aside class="notes">Continuity: If bundle A pref B and $C$ 'lies within an epsilon radius of $B$ than A pref C.

  Adding this to the previous axioms $\rightarrow$ utility representation.

 Also ensures continuous utility functions and allow ... 'marginal utility' and gradually sloping demand curves

 of course differential utility ensures continuity</aside>

 <aside class="notes">LC/CQ: What preferences (later in this chapter) suggest *not* differentiable utility? Were these continuous?(rem -- right and left shoes)

 What about 'lexicographic'? preferences</aside>

<aside class="notes">Axiom 3 (nonsatiation) makes the maths more convenient, and is necessary for some results/predictions</aside>

<aside class="notes">Strictly, most results only require the weaker 'local nonsatiation' condition</aside>

# Marginal rate of substitution (MRS)

<aside class="notes">2024, Adv, math: This slope will equal the negative of the *ratio* of the rate at which utility increases in each good (partial derivative).

   Intuition: giving up a certain utility from one good must be balanced by an increase in utility from the other good.</aside>



- (So the MRS is the ratio itself, because it's the absolute value.)

- Formally, the MRS at point $X,Y$, where $U(X,Y)=U_1$ is:

# Preference for variety/balance

![Fig 2.3](picsfigs/indifcurvebalance.png) \

<aside class="notes">Adv: this 'preference for variety' is thought to hold for most combinations of goods, most of the time, but perhaps not for all pairings.

It tends to lead to easy-to-solve 'interior solutions' where people may consume some amount of each good, and have smooth reactions to price changes.

Extreme of this is 'necessity' goods. </aside>

<aside class="notes">LC: Adjust previous picture on visualiser/board</aside>

<aside class="notes">With an indifference curve with this shape ('convex')


  any consumption bundle that represents a 'mixture' between two equally attractive extremes will be preferred to those extremes


E.g., if I like bundles A and D equally, I prefer a bundle of 1/3 of a and 2/3 of D to either A or D.</aside>


----

More formal concept: (strictly) convex preferences $\Leftrightarrow$  (strictly) 'quasiconcave' utility function, allowing  'n goods':


With diminishing MRS, for a 'convex combination' of the two bundles $\mathbf{A}=(X_A,Y_A)$ and $\mathbf{D}=(X_D,Y_D)$


<!-- . . . -->


$$U(\alpha\mathbf{A}+(1-\alpha)\mathbf{D})\geq\alpha U(\mathbf{A}) + (1-\alpha)U(\mathbf{D})$$

where $0<\alpha<1$.

(Note switch to a 'weak inequality' here for quasiconcavity, strict for 'strict quasiconcavity')


<!-- . . . -->

e.g., (with two goods),


$$U(\alpha X_A + (1-\alpha)X_D,\alpha Y_A + (1-\alpha)Y_D)\geq  $$
$$\alpha(U((X_A,Y_A)) + (1-\alpha)(U(X_D,Y_D))$$


<aside class="notes">One reason economists like this 'quasiconcavity' is because it rules out local, but not global optima, so we only need to use

 the first-order conditions to find the optima.

 Looking under the lamp or 'without loss of generality'?</aside>

 <aside class="notes">Note that 'quasiconcavity' does not require differentiability,

 and it is preserved under a 'monotonic transformation' (stretching).

 This means its called an 'ordinal property'</aside>

<aside class="notes">Holds for all relevant properties, including MRS; see Autor's Lecture 3</aside>

Perfect substitutes

: when she is always willing to trade off A for B at a fixed rate (not necessarily 1 for 1)

Perfect complements

Slope $-Px/Py$: How much $Y$ I must sacrifice to get another unit of $X$.



To get another $X$ it costs me $P_xX$, so the more costly is $X$ the more $Y$ I must give up.

For each  $Y$ I give up I save $P_Y$, so the more costly is $Y$ the more I can save by giving up 1 unit of it,

thus, the less I need to sacrifice of $Y$ to get another unit of $X$.

### Budget constraint algebra


If I spend all my income `r format_with_col("(I will do over a 'relevant lifetime')","gray")`:

\

<!-- \pause -->



Expenditure on X + Expenditure on Y = Income (I)

\

$$P_X X + P_Y Y = I $$


<!-- . . . -->


To see how $Y$ trades off against $X$, rearrange this to:


<!-- . . . -->


\

$$Y = -\frac{P_X}{P_Y} X + \frac{I}{P_Y}$$


<!-- . . . -->


- Intercept $\frac{I}{P_Y}$: amount of Y you can buy if you only buy Y
- Slope $-\frac{P_X}{P_Y}$: how much Y you must give up to get another X

<!---
<aside class="notes">Adv: Strictly speaking, the slope is how much Y you *get* when you get another X,

but since this is negative we see that you 'get a negative amount', i.e., give up some amount of Y</aside>

what they mean, and have intuition for why the slope has this formula. See 'micro quiz 2.3'.</aside>

### More insight


Recall $U=U(X,Y)$.

$$U_X(X,Y) := MU_X(X,Y)$$

\medskip


<!-- . . . -->


*Derivative w/ respect to X: rate utility increases if we add a little X, holding Y constant*

- Similarly for $MU_Y$.


<!-- . . . -->




MRS: 'how much Y would I be willing to give up to get a unit of X'?

<!-- . . . -->

Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each ... we can show $MRS(X,Y)=\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}$

<aside class="notes">Intuition: the more valuable a little more X is to me  -- the higher is MU_X --

  the more Y I am willing to give up to get it. That is why MU_X is in the numerator</aside>

<aside class="notes">See derivation in handout if interested</aside>


----


The 'first order change in utility' (or 'total differential') is:

$$ dU  = \frac{\partial U}{\partial X}dX + \frac{\partial U}{\partial Y}dY$$
$$ = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY$$

- Where = $\frac{\partial U}{\partial X}$ refers to the partial derivative of U(X,Y) with respect to X, and similarly for Y. I.e., the marginal utility.

<!-- . . . -->



Essentially, approximates the total change in utility for very small changes in X and Y.
Setting it equal to zero and rearranging it yields the rate, at the margin, one is willing to give up Y for X:


$$ dU  = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY = 0 $$

$$\frac{dY}{dX}=-\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}$$



<aside class="notes">This is a simple case of the implicit function theorem,

 essentially $U(X,Y)=c$ defines an implicit function Y(X), whose slope is the negative of the ratio of the derivatives.</aside>




----


Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields more intuition:

$$P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y$$
\


<!-- . . . -->


(at each consumption point X,Y)

\medskip

$$\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$$


<!-- . . . -->


Same 'bang for each buck' (`r format_with_col("if","red")` optimising)

<aside class="notes">If this didn't hold true and you were spending on both goods,

you would be paying 'more per util' for one good than the other,

and thus should reallocate to that other good.</aside>


<aside class="notes">The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point

 -- the higher is MU_x -- the more Y I'm willing to give up to get it.

That is why MU_x is in the numerator.
The more valuable a bit more Y is at that point -- the higher is MU_y -- the less Y I am willing to give up to get a bit more X.

 That is why MU_y is in the denominator</aside>

This is *"homothetic"*:


<aside class="notes">Homothetic: MRS constant along a ray through the origin

ties down 'income effects' in a boring way

consumption of each good expands proportionally in income,
