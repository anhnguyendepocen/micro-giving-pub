-  How do economists define a public good? What fits into this category?

-  Better understand 'market failures'

. . .


-  Be able to explain: why a competitive market will usually undersupply} a public good, but may still supply \underline{some} of it

Understand (in general):


- difficulties *government* faces in providing the right amount/mix of public goods

- General patterns and evidence on *voluntary* provision of public goods, including in 'lab experiments'
    - ... and what are 'lab experiments' in Economics?

## Market failures

... Occur when prices don't fully reflect the marginal social benefits or costs

- May provide scope for political intervention

- How does this happen?

# Public Goods (attributes, categories)

## Public Goods (attributes, categories)

What are the characteristics of a public good?


----

*Def* -- A **Pure Public Good** is a good that is both


. . .


1. *Non-excludable*: Once the good is provided, it is impossible/costly to prevent any individual from using/benefiting from it.

<aside class="notes">Even individuals who have not paid for it</aside>

<aside class="notes">Opposite: Exclusive goods*: ... if it is relatively easy to bar people from benefitting from it once it has been produced</aside>



. . .

2. *Non-rival:* One person's consumption doesn't reduce the quantity available for others.



. . .


- The fact that some people use the good doesn't prevent others from using the *same* good.

- There is no 'crowding.'

- Provision/consumption to additional users at zero marginal (social) cost.


<aside class="notes">Q: think of some examples.</aside>

<aside class="notes">
<small> In market economies, private suppliers provide the majority of goods and services to consumers. However, certain goods are publicly provided. These include for example defense, education, and health. Why does the government instead of the market provide these goods?  Which characteristics differentiate goods that are privately provided from goods that are publicly provided? How do we define public goods? The terminology might induce the conclusion that '----public goods are good that are publicly provided as opposed to private goods which are privately provided.' This conclusion is simply WRONG! The public or private nature of the good is an intrinsic characteristic of goods that is not related to the provider of the good
Hence, it may well be that the state provides a private good or that
the market provides a public good. </small> </aside>

**What about?**

- Loud music coming from my window
- Disease control
- Economic research

----

**The basic ideas**

If a good is *non-rival* then additional provision (of the units produced, to more consumers) is costless.

. . .

Thus,

- if exclusion is possible, and *any* positive price is charged, some are deterred from consuming it


. . .


- this is inefficient: people who could benefit from the good, at no cost to others, will not consume it :(


And...

----

(If non-rival)

Even if each person provided it for their *own* benefit (on the assumption that no one else would), they would typically choose *too little* from a social POV...


<br> <br> \bigskip

Considering their own marginal benefits (and MRS) versus the price or cost, not the *social* marginal benefit (an 'externality' to them)



----

If a good is *non-excludable* it will be difficult to charge people for it

- many will prefer to wait for *others* to buy it, and then they enjoy it anyways (free-ride) `r format_with_col("(that's a 'coordination problem')","gray")`

. . .

But if firms cannot charge for its full value, they might not pay the fixed costs to develop/build/provide it

. . .

Who would pay to produce a film that is freely pirated/distributed?
Who would pay to develop a drug that must be priced at its marginal cost?
Why contribute to police protection for your village, if your neighbours will pay for it anyways?

<aside class="notes">Loosely, 'rivalryness' basically relates to whether market provision will be *efficient*,

 while 'excludability' tells you whether firms can make *significant amounts of revenue* from providing it, selling (access to) the same produced good to more than one person</aside>

### Application: drug development [SELF-STUDY]

*Drug R&D may be a public good, or a common resource*

. . .

Expensive to develop and introduce a new drug -- 'sunk costs' once developed

. . .


But cheap to copy and produce; without patent protection may have $P=mc$ and no ex-post profit to compensate for sunk costs \


<br> <br> \bigskip


. . .



$\rightarrow$ No incentive to develop drugs without patent protection guaranteeing 'excludability' and a limited monopoly



----

`r format_with_col("(...drug development)","gray")`

<br> <br> \bigskip


But ex-post, patent protection is costly; drug produced for a few pennies, sold for \pounds1000's

- People may not buy, or NHS may not cover


. . .


- $\rightarrow$ Inefficient: some consumers may value drug at \pounds100's, far above MC, yet they don't consume it


. . .


- Possible solution: Government *awards* and subsidies for drug development.

<aside class="notes">In fact, governments do fund and subsidise R&D. But there are difficulties here too. Governments may free-ride off of other governments.

It is also for government to know whom to fund, hard to quantify the benefits to potential drugs, and offering 'prizes' to developers offers its own challenges:

how to asses if the drug is good enough to deserve the prize? And too many firms working on the same drug may be wasteful.</aside>

# Public Goods and Market Failure

## Public Goods and Market Failure

The First Welfare Theorem's assumptions/conditions do not apply to public goods. Markets do not yield a Pareto Optimal outcome.

<aside class="notes">The market will not produce where the consumers' MRS equals the rate at which public and private goods 'trade off in production'.

 More of the public good could be produced by sacrificing some of the private good, and consumers will be better off.</aside>

 <br> <br> \bigskip


<aside class="notes">To fully analyse these problems we need to know the techniques of 'mechanism design under asymmetric information', which we are not covering in this module</aside>



- Non-excludability $\rightarrow$ coordination problems $\rightarrow$ no price or suboptimal price $\rightarrow$ firms don't get the correct signals for production


. . .


- Non-rivalry $\rightarrow$ each unit provides benefit to all, consumer choices don't reflect this$\rightarrow$ firms don't get correct signals

----

### Social benefit of a private good vs a public good

- Overall value of a private good: (area under the) 'horizontal sum' of individual marginal benefit curves

    - Because 'only one person consumes each unit'

. . .


<br> <br> \bigskip

- Public goods: 'everyone consumes the same unit'

$\rightarrow$ *aggregate* value, thus 'social marginal benefit' of public good sums *vertically*

# Optimal provision of public goods

## Optimal provision of public goods (more formal)

<small>**Move to board and web-book for detailed solution here** </small>


Normalizations, basically "WLOG":

- Each £ spent (or £ of cost incurred) on the private good (X) yields "1 util", and costs £1

-  Same quasilinear utility function for everyone

$$u_i(x,G)= x + u(G)$$, where $G=\sum_{i=1}^{N}$


\

. . .

Assume diminishing MRS

$\rightarrow$ we have the unique optimum provision... requires $G=G^\ast$ sets:


$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\partial u_i(x_i,G)}{\partial G}/MC(G) = \frac{\partial u_i(x_i,G)}{\partial x_i}/MC(x)$$

<aside class="notes">
<small> The 'bang for the buck' must be equal (at least if the problem is symmetric).
 If net utility can be gained by adding  a unit of resource towards the production of  one good and taking it away from the other, we cannot be at an optimum point.
Note that an additional unit of the public good yields value to *all* individuals (hence the sum term), while an additional unit of the private good only benefits one person. </small>
	</aside>

----

\
Given our normalisations, simplify to ...



$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\partial u(G)}{\partial G}/MC(G) = 1$$


I.e.,
$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} MB_i(G) = MC(G)$$

<aside class="notes">
Normalization ...that each unit of the private good yields one unit of utility  $\frac{\partial u_i(x_i,G)}{\partial x_i}/mc_x=1$ and the utility is quasilinear and the same for everyone this simplifies to
...Note that here MC(G) essentially expresses the MRT and MB_i is essentially i's MRS, as the private good yields a constant marginal utility.
	</aside>

----



**Now... individuals' private contributions w/o intervention**

Denote ... $G \equiv\sum_{i=1}^{N}g_i$ ...$g_{-i}\equiv G-g_i$.

\

"Symmetric interior solution, best-response 'equilibrium'''

. . .

\
\


*Given amount provided by others, I 'top-up' until my  PRIVATE marginal benefit  equals the cost:


$$\frac{\partial u_i(g_i+g_{-i})}{\partial g_i}\equiv MB_i(g_i+g_{-i})\equiv MB_i(G)=mc(G)$$

<small> ... the old 'bang for the buck' ... but here it's the 'private bang'. </small>
\

<aside class="notes">
Consider individuals  ($i=i..N$) who privately best-respond to each  others' choices; an 'equilibrium'. Consider an interior solution where everyone provides a positive amount of the public good. Here (incorporating the normalisation)... they will choose to provide amounts of the public good $g_i$ such that,
	</aside>

----


$$\frac{\partial u_i(g_i+g_{-i})}{\partial g_i}\equiv MB_i(g_i+g_{-i})\equiv MB_i(G)=mc(G)$$

Clearly *not* compatible with  condition for  Pareto-optimal provision (if $N>1$):


$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} MB_i(G) = MC(G)$$


----

Stated slightly differently we have have the **"Samuelson condition"** for optimal provision


$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} MRS_i(G,X) = MRT(G,X)$$

\

For the efficient mix of public and private goods (top-level efficiency)... the *sum* of each individual's MRS's must equal the economy's MRT.

\

Cf private goods: top-level efficiency required that for each individual $i$ the $MRS_i=MRT$.


<aside class="notes">
This can be derived by solving the  "Pareto problem":
maximise 1 person's utility
subject to holding all others' utility at or above a threshold
and s.t. the "aggregate production constraint"
See [Durham lecture 12](http://community.dur.ac.uk/t.i.renstrom/teaching/PUBECON/Lect_12.pdf) for a 2-household case deriving this.

### Practice question

Consider an economy with N individuals each with income m which they can use for own consumption c at “numeraire” price 1 (representing the cost of production), or contribute to a public good.

Suppose each individual’s utility is:  $U_i(c,G)= c + ln(G)$

\

1. What is the optimal total provision of this public good?

2. What will be the total private voluntary provision? Does it matter if we consider only 'symmetric' equilibria or if we allow asymmetric provision (some provided more than others)

3. Show/argue that an omniscient and powerful government could ensure an outcome that is a Pareto-improvement over the symmetric private outcome?


4. Now let $U_i = c+0.9*(G)$; answer the above questions for this case.

## Government's role

- Pure public goods not provided optimally by free market, i.e., voluntarily
    - although people *do* contribute to public goods, e.g., making charitable donations, for various reasons

<aside class="notes">except in really special and lucky cases</aside>



. . .


A justification for government: to enforce contributions to public goods, and make everyone better off

<aside class="notes">Adv: or, allowing heterogeneous tastes, achieve a 'potential Pareto improvement';

those who benefit could compensate those who are harmed and still all would be better off.</aside>

- **But** it's hard to determine tastes for the public good, hence difficult to determine the optimal level!


## Revealing the Demand for Public Goods (brief)


Suppose some people like fireworks, and some don't. How many should the town pay for?


. . .


i. Ask everyone to state the number of fireworks they want, and we choose the average and split costs evenly?

<aside class="notes">Q: would this work?</aside>


. . .


- $\rightarrow$ Fireworks-lovers may overstate their value to skew the average.






ii. Ask everyone to state number they want; choose average; those who stated more pay more?


. . .


- $\rightarrow$ Many people understate their value to avoid having to pay. Doh!
