Is game theory useful???

Some people [seem to think so](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eyal-winter-739b6b44_if-you-have-economics-students-who-complain-activity-6595028520324472832-dbJa/?fbclid=IwAR2K_dmkK7vazjZa6GRa3ZtSMWXhgLE30Fe0wzZ1ezPzNibYG7_Q5hn5jog):

## Basic concepts (strategic interaction, elements of a game))

Previous: Each individual (consumer, firm, etc) takes all others' choices as given

- market price, demand curve, etc.

<br> <br> \bigskip

Now: Consider 'strategic interaction'

- My best choice may depend on your choice
- And vice versa
- Sequential games: My earlier choices may change your later choices



## Some examples



`r format_with_col("Is it better to get lunch at Comida or Pret?","blue")`


<br> <br> \bigskip


What if your friends are going to Comida?


<br> <br> \bigskip


What if everyone and her cousin are going to Comida, so the queue is miles long?



\

`r format_with_col("What should Tim Cook charge for his new Iphone?","blue")`


<br> <br> \bigskip


Does it depend on whether Samsung and LG...


... Sell their phones for £200, or £1000, or go out of business?


\

Think about:

> Find a situation in business, government, fiction, history or your own life ...

> where one party's optimal choice depends on what another party does.



*Write it down*, `r format_with_col("give 1-sentence explanation of why it involves 'strategic dependence'","gray")`


\

Some possible examples:

Life:

- Ask out your crush or not?


<br> \bigskip


Politics:

- Country makes war or peace? Soldiers fight or run away?

- Run for office or not? Party contests a seat? If so, how much to spend on campaign?


<br> \bigskip


Standard Economics:

- Amount to bid at a first-price auction?

- Whether Firezza opens a new branch in Exeter, and where?

- How hard to work towards a promotion at your job?


Very interesting problems, does Econ and Game Theory have the solutions?



### What game theory can do (wet blanket) {-}


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","Eeyore_Pink.jpg"))
```

Game theory gives us a language and framework for analyzing strategic situations

The 'solution concepts' can be said to make 'predictions' under given assumptions.

The idea of 'equilibrium' is defined as a baseline
\

Dr. Reinstein says: Sometimes overrated as a tool for predicting how people/firms will actually behave.

\


- It often makes multiple predictions, or predicts 'mixed strategies' (randomisation).

- Real-world and experimental choices are often/arguably predicted poorly by classical game theory.

- For example, standard game theory says chess has a pre-determined outcome and is a bit boring (ok, you may agree about the latter).

```{block2,  type='technote'}

Adv: But there are complicating issues making it difficult to asses the predictions of game theory.

Particularly because monetary payoff may not be the same as utility payoffs ... this can make real-world predictions unclear.

Particularly if there are social preferences or fairness preferences.\

We also see failures to coordinate,
failure to take higher-order cognitive steps
and preferences over the *manner decisions are made*.
These make Game Theoretic predictions difficult.

```


## Four elements describe a game


1. Players

2. Strategies

3. Payoffs

4. Information

\

Players
:     the decision makers in the game

<br> \bigskip

$2, 3, ...  N$ players

\

<br> <br> \bigskip

*Who are the players in Chicken?* 1.   The north-facing car 'North' and 2. the south-facing car 'South'

\

Strategies
:      a player’s choices in a game (at each 'decision node')

- in simple games the same as actions
- may be a plan contingent on what another player has done
- may involve randomization

<br> <br> \bigskip

*Strategies/actions in Chicken?* For both N and S, two actions -- Pull-off, Straight.

\

Payoffs

:     The utility to each player arising from the combination of each player's strategies (and chance) in the game

- May include both 'money earned' and other considerations; all this is summarised in the payoff numbers

- The goal of each player is to obtain the largest payoff that she can obtain (not just to 'win')

Note: E.g., each player prefers to get 2 in *utility* and have the other player get 8 than for both to get 1

Note: In this context it is typically not helpful to complain 'I don't think players will maximise their payoffs, because they also care about how others do, etc.' Whatever it is they care about can be expressed in the theoretical payoffs.\

However, these concerns are relevant to experiments that may incorrectly assume participants are maximising only their monetary payoffs.\

\


[comment]: <> (101BB)

```{block2,  type='technote'}
```   There are also certain kinds of 'psychological' motivations that cannot be modeled in a straightforward way by payoffs. (see 'psychological games').
```

[comment]: <> (101EE)

\

*Payoffs in chicken?*


- Both pull-off $\rightarrow$  Tie


- N Straight, S pulls off $\rightarrow$ N 'wins', S 'loses'

- N pulls off, S straight $\rightarrow$ N 'loses', S 'wins'


- Both straight $\rightarrow$ crash




*To meaningfully  convey this game* payoffs must follow: Win $\succ$ tie  $\succ$ lose $\succ$ crash

\


Here is an example of payoffs that capture the essential strategic considerations in 'Chicken' (payoffs written as a matrix)


```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

library(magrittr)
library(kableExtra)

# Define Variables
W=1
L=-1
T=0
C=-10

# Assign Pairs
pair <- function(x,y) sprintf("(%d,%d)", x,y)
all_pairs <- c(pair(T,T), pair(W,L), pair(L,W), pair(C,C))
payoff.mat <- matrix(all_pairs, nrow=2)
dimnames(payoff.mat) <- c(rep(list(c("Pull off","Straight")), 2))
results = "asis"

# Plot
payoff.mat %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()



```


*Note that what will matter are the *relative payoffs* and not the absolute levels... (at least, if we ignore 'mixed strategies' for now).

\


Information

:     what each player knows, at a particular point in the game, about payoffs and previous actions

- For *sequential* games, players may or may not know other players' previous actions

(in this module we will only cover the case where they *do* know previous actions taken)




## Illustrating Games

### The Prisoners’ Dilemma: Normal form {-}

*The original story*:

> Two individuals are arrested for a crime.  They both know that they can only be convicted for a lesser crime, for which they get 2 years in jail. DA (Chief Crown Prosecutor) puts them in separate rooms and offers each the same deal. If you confess and your partner stays quiet you will only get 1 year in jail and they will get 10 years.
oIf you both confess you will each get 3 years.

\


What would you do? What would most people do? What does game theory predict?

<br> \bigskip

Which *outcome* is *definitely NOT* Pareto-optimal (for the prisoners)?


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='65%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","pd_normal.png"))
```

- Normal form payoff matrix (also called 'matrix form')

- Payoff convention: listed in the order (row's payoffs, column's payoffs)

<br> \bigskip

**A Prisoner's Dilemma be like**^[Note to non-native-English speakers... I am shamelessly pandering to the youth here by trying to use their jargon. 'Be like' is not proper usage in the Queen's English]


**A Prisoner's Dilemma be like**


Two Players: (A and B, row and column, whatever)


Strategies (Actions): 'Cooperate' (C) or defect (D)


In normal form:


```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

# Define Variables

# Assign Pairs
pair <- function(x,y) sprintf("(%s,%s)", x,y)
all_pairs <- c(pair("R","R"), pair("T","S"), pair("S","T"), pair("P","P"))
payoff.mat <- matrix(all_pairs, nrow=2)
dimnames(payoff.mat) <- c(rep(list(c("Cooperate","Defect")), 2))
results = "asis"

# Plot
payoff.mat %>% kable() %>%kable_styling()

```

To be a prisoner's dilemma game the payoffs must satisfy $T > R > P > S$

I.e., Temptation $>$ Reward $>$ Punishment $>$ Sucker

\


### The Prisoners’ Dilemma: Extensive form {-}

We can depict the same game in another format which we call the 'extensive form':

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","pd_extensive.png"))
```

\
Above: the oval (usually this is given as dashed lines) depict the  'information set'/

Sequential moves games *without* knowledge of previous moves are essentially equivalent to simultaneous move games.
Here, B may 'move second' but he doesn't know A's move (in the graphic above, he doesn't know "which side he is on"), so it's as if this is simultaneous.

\
 Order only matters if you observe the earlier action

However, typically, we use the *extensive form* for sequential games and the *"normal form"* (basically, the matrix form) for simultaneous games.

\


*Note:* `r format_with_col("This fancy terminology seems confusing and unnecessary.  The reason for it involves more formal definitions of 'extensive' and 'normal' games and some deeper technical issues that we skip here.","gray")`

\




## Common knowledge

- What all players know, and
- all players know that all other players know,
- and all players know that all other players know that all other players know,
- and all players know that all other players know that all other players know that all other players know,

 etc.

Note: By the way, we always assume that the rules of the game are common knowledge.


\


Why is common knowledge important?


```{block2,  type='note'}

Among other things, you may be stuck on an island 'with 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru'
- [XKCD_link](https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html "puzzle")
- [XKCD solution link](https://xkcd.com/solution.html "solution" )
- [Rob Heaton version, more violent](http://robertheaton.com/2014/01/06/how-to-win-at-dinner-party-the-blue-eyed-islanders/ "puzzle and solution")
- [Ted-ed video](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-famously-difficult-green-eyed-logic-puzzle-alex-gendler)

\

Warning: this puzzle will do your head in

\


 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","blue-eyed.png"))

\

There is an island with 1000 people.
- 100 of them have blue eyes, 900 have brown eyes
- There are no reflective surfaces


By custom or law:

> He who knows own eye colour must commit suicide the next day in the town square
>  No one can discuss another person's eye colour.

Now an American tourist visits, and says "It’s so nice to see one or more people with blue eyes in this part of the world”.

<br> \bigskip


Q: *What effect, if any, does this faux pas have on the island?*


<br> \bigskip


Ans: If his statement is 'common knowledge' then all 100 blue-eyed people will kill themselves on day 100 after the speech.!

```


\

A's *Best Response* (BR) to strategy *S*:

:     A strategy for player A that gives him the highest payoff of all his possible strategies, given that the other player(s) play *S*

\

Note: The BR is a function of the others' strategies *S*; it may take a different value for each strategy the others play.

\


## Dominant, dominated strategies and rationalizability

*Note: Iterated strict dominance and rationalizability are NOT covered in the NS text, but I want you to learn it.  As a prediction it is much easier to justify than Nash Equilibrium.*

<br> \bigskip

Dominant strategy
:     A single strategy that is a best response to *any* of the other player’s strategies.

- A simple prediction: a 'rational' player will play a dominant strategy, if she has one.


Dominated strategy (not in text!)
:     Strategy A is dominated by strategy B if B yields higher payoffs for *any* of the other player’s strategies

- A simple prediction: a rational player will *never* play a dominated strategy

*Why?*: because a dominated strategy  cannot be optimal for *any* belief about what the other player(s) will do



<br> \bigskip

```{block2,  type='note'}
With only two strategies to choose from these concepts are the same.

With more than two, if there is a Dominant strategy this means that all other strategies are dominated by it. We see this in examples below.
```

\

`r format_with_col("What is the prediction of 'players play dominant strategies' in Prisoner's dilemma","blue")`


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='55%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","pd_normal.png"))
```
Here it clearly predicts that both will confess. However, in other games this concept may have no clear prediction

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='65%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","matrixforISD.png"))
```

`r format_with_col("Consider","blue")`: What does 'players play dominant strategies' predict above? What about 'players never play dominated strategies'?

\


## Rationalisability/ Iterated strict dominance (not in NS text!)

Extending this ...

**Rationality assumption:** the players are rational.

We know rational players will not play dominated strategies
The players *themselves* know this.

<br> \bigskip

**Common Knowledge of Rationality assumption:**

The players know all other players are rational. The players know all players know all players are rational.  The players know (all players know … ad infinitum) all players are rational.

- Thus the players know what the other players will never do, and eliminate these from consideration
- The players will not play a strategy if another strategy is always better against this reduced set of possibilities
- Etc.

This process is called 'Iterated Strict Dominance' (ISD) We will call strategies that survive ISD **'rationalizable' strategies**

`r format_with_col("Adv: There are differences between 'rationalizable' and 'survives ISD' but for our purposes these are basically the same","RawSienna")`


\

ISD example; may yield a unique prediction


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","matrixforISD.png"))
```


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","isd1.png"))
```

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","isd2.png"))
```


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","isd3.png"))
```


\

However, there may be *no* dominated strategies, or there may be *some*, but still ISD may leave many possibilities:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bossmall.png"))
```

\

## Equilibrium

Market equilibrium (review): given the equilibrium price and quantity, no market participant has an incentive to change his or her behaviour.


<br> \bigskip


In strategic settings, we have a similar concept:

Nash equilibrium (NE)
:     A set of *strategies*, one for each player, that are best responses against one another


- If I play my BR to your chosen strategy and you're playing your BR to mine, neither of us has an incentive to deviate --- an equilibrium.

- All games have at least one Nash equilibrium
    - But it may be an equilibrium in 'mixed strategies' (involving randomisation)

- Caveat: we might not expect such play to actually occur (particularly not in one-shot games)


`r format_with_col("In fact, 2-player games will have an *odd* number of equilibria; you can see this by looking at the crosses of the BR functions","gray")`


### Two ways to find the Nash equilibrium (NE)


1. Inspection: Check each outcome one by one. See if either player has an incentive to *unilaterally* deviate.  If not, it’s an equilibrium.


<br> \bigskip


2. Underline method: For each player underline the payoff he would get if he played his best response to each of the other player’s actions. Any outcome where there are *two* underlines is *the outcome of* an equilibrium strategy profile.



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","pd_normal.png"))
```


```{block2,  type='note'}
Caveat: this only works in a game with a countable set of actions ... a 'matrix' game,
If the actions are a continuous variable (e.g., price, quantity) you must solve for point(s) where these functions meet, as we shall see.
```



Note this is the same 'prediction' as dominant strategies, but the interpretations are different;
This is not by accident, there are general results, [some of which we discuss below...](#relconcepts)

\

Recall again that the NE, and the prediction of 'players play dominant strategies' (also 'rationalisability')
yields the single outcome that is clearly NOT pareto optimal. Lesson  group and individual interests don't always align

\


Exercise: Find equilibrium via each method:


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='55%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","pd_normal.png"))
```
\

### Relationship between dominant strategies, rationalisability, and Nash equilibrium {#relconcepts}


If eliminating dominated strategies yields a single prediction for each player, these strategies are a Nash equilibrium. The same holds for eliminating by iteration (rationalizability) ... if this leads to a unique prediction, it's a NE.

However, not every Nash equilibrium involves dominant strategies

\


### Efficiency and the PD (redux)

*Lesson: The group interests and individual interests do not always align*

`r format_with_col("In the Prisoner's dillemma, if the players were allowed to communicate what would seem to be the best outcome?","blue")`


Both staying silent would be better for both than the outcome in the NE: 2 yrs vs. 3 yrs

However binding agreements are not allowed, and "cheap talk" communication should not help... (There's a game show about this! People 'promise' they will share and then they often turn around and steal.)

\


## Coordination and anti-coordination games


### Coordination: Battle of the sexes (BOS) {-}

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosmatrix.png"))
```
- to make it more PC, assume it is a very violent ballet and a very gentle boxing match

\

### Anti-coordination: Matching pennies (odds/evens) {-}

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","matchpennies.png"))
```

Note:  Underline best responses, show no pure strategy NE here

\


## Mixed strategies


Pure strategy
:     Consists of a single action played with certainty

<br> \bigskip

Mixed strategy
:     Assigns a probability to each possible action

<br> \bigskip

*Remember: there is always at least one NE. If there is no pure strategy NE, there will be a NE in mixed strategies.*

\

### Matching pennies: mixed strategies {-}

**Intuition**

If you choose heads/tails half the time then I'm indifferent between heads or tails. Thus, choosing heads half the time is *among* my best responses.

If I choose heads half the time then you're indifferent between heads/tails. Thus choosing heads half the time is *among* your best responses

So, technically, each of us choosing heads half the time is a NE. `r format_with_col("(But it is called a 'weak' NE because either of us would do no *worse* if he deviated alone.)","gray")`

\

### Battle of sexes: mixed strategies {-}

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosmatrix.png"))
```

*Note:* Wife wants to end up at the same place as her husband but doesn’t know where he is going.\

- If she believes that he will always go to the ballet she should always go to the ballet.\

- If she believes he will always go boxing, she should go boxing.\

- What other beliefs may she have?

We want to derive the best response functions, and find the intersection(s) of these.

Let $h$ represent the probability husband chooses Ballet


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosmatrix.png"))
```
\

**Wife's BR:**

- Wife chooses Ballet iff her Expected payoff of Ballet > Expected payoff of Boxing

<br> \bigskip


I.e., $2h > 1- h$, i.e, $h > 1/3$

Thus, wife goes to Ballet if she believes husband goes to Ballet more than 1/3 of the time

- If she thinks he goes below 1/3 of the time she goes to Boxing

- If she thinks he goes *exactly* 1/3 of the time she is indifferent


\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosbr1.png"))
```

*Note:* This plots the value of w that best responds to h;\ the probability the wife goes Ballet given the probability the husband goes Boxing.

\

Let $w$ denote the probability wife chooses Ballet

\

**Husband's BR:**

<br> \bigskip


Husband chooses Ballet iff his Expected payoff of Ballet > Expected payoff of Boxing

$$1w > 2- 2w$$, i.e., $$w > 2/3$$ ... for these payoffs


Thus, husband goes to Ballet if he believes wife goes Ballet more than 2/3 of the time

- If he thinks she goes less than 2/3 of the time he goes to Boxing

- If she thinks he goes *exactly* 2/3 of the time he is indifferent


```{block2,  type='technote'}
 Note that now that we are considering mixed strategies the ratios of the payoffs may matter in computing the equilibrium mixing probabilities, and not only 'which is larger'. Recall that this also was the case when we considered expected utility over uncertain outcomes.

```

\


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosbr2.png"))
```


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosbr3.png"))
```


*Shortcut to computing this:* only someone who is indifferent will randomise. (Otherwise they must strictly prefer one or the other action, so 'mixing these' cannot be optimal.)

\

Above, $h=1/3$ makes wife indifferent, $w=2/3$ makes husband indifferent


\


### What's all this rot? {-}

Mixed strategies are not about 'being unpredictable', in spite of what some texts say ; these are one-shot games!

\


Some texts and authors make this point about 'unpredictability' but others disagree (including myself). Making sure that it is impossible to predict your later play from your previous is only important if you are playing the same game repeatedly, and being observed.

```{block2,  type='technote'}
It makes a bit more sense if we think about 'populations.

Suppose in a population 1/3 of men go to Ballet and 2/3 of women go to Ballet:
... these ratios are 'stable'; no reason for systematic changes.
On the other hand, if men always went to boxing and women to ballet this is not stable. A husband would be better off going to ballet ... so the ratios should change over time.}

```
\

### Computing payoffs with mixing {-}

Remember, formally, a  NE specifies *strategies* (strategy 'profiles') not payoffs

In the BOS the pure strategy equilibria were

- i. Husband: Boxing, Wife: Boxing
- ii. Husband: Ballet, Wife: Ballet

\

The mixed-strategy NE was:

-  iii. Husband: go Ballet with probability h=1/3, Wife: Go Ballet with prob w=2/3.

The *payoffs* to these were, respectively

i. Husband: 2, Wife: 1

ii. Husband: 1, Wife: 2

iii. ... ??

\

Payoff to the mixed strategy:

Payoffs are utilities: thus under the Expected Utility model we sum the utility of each outcome $\times$ probability of that outcome

- Prob(Both go Ballet) = $w \times h = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$
- Prob(Both go Boxing) = $(1-w)(1-h) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$
- Prob(Wife Ballet, Husband Boxing) = $w(1-h) = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{9}$
- Prob(Wife Boxing, Husband Ballet) = $(1-w)(h) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$

<br> \bigskip

Thus, under the mixed strategy NE play:

$$U_{husb} =  \frac{2}{9} \times 1 +  \frac{2}{9} \times 2 +  \frac{4}{9} \times 0 + \frac{1}{9} \times 0 = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$$
$$U_{wife} = \frac{2}{3}$$

(The wife's payoffs can be  inferred from symmetry of problem, or they can be similarly calculated.)


\

## How do you solve a problem like multiple-equilibria?

<br> \bigskip


Above (BOS), there are three equilibria: both play Boxing, both play Ballet, and the mixed strategy

- Are any of these more reasonable as predicted outcomes?

### Multiple equilibrium and refinements {-}

We refer to *refinement criteria* and *focal points*. For example...

1. 'Choose the equilibrium with the highest payoffs for both?'  In BOS this rules out mixing (payoffs 2/3, 2/3 for h,w respectively).
But it doesn't say whether we should predict Box, Box (payoffs 2,1) or Ballet, Ballet (payoffs 1,2)

2. Choose the 'symmetric equilibrium?' ... here, mixing

3. Choose the one that seems like a 'focal point'? (remember the 'big game')


\


### Is there a focal point? {-}

*In-lecture 'experiment':*

A year after graduating you come back for Alumni Weekend.  You are supposed to meet the veterans of this module for a night of festivities but can’t remember where or when. The internet does not exist.

- Where do you go?  Students: write it down on a piece of paper  Now type what you wrote in to the chat window

- What if you are meeting for a reunion in New York City, and no one has internet or phone access? Where do you go?  Write it down.  Type it into the chat window.

## Sequential Games




\

How does the Battle of Sexes game change if Wife chooses first, Husband observes her choice, and then he chooses

What do you think will happen? Vote (clickers):

- A. Wife: Ballet, Husband: Box
- B. Wife: Ballet, Husband: Ballet
- C. Wife: Box, Husband: Ballet
- D. Wife: Box, Husband: Box

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","BOS_sequential.png"))
```

*Note:* Remember, it's a one-shot game ... unrealistic within a marriage of course


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","BOS_sequential.png"))
```

- The wife has two strategies: Ballet or Boxing
- The husband has four contingent strategies, but we focus on what he will do in each of his two possible 'decision nodes'


 ```{block2,  type='note'}
Here we see there is a 'first-mover advantage'. \

We see a very similar strategic concern in other contexts, including 'which firm enters a market first'. Suppose that if two firms are in a market there will be a price war with consumers as well as a bidding up of input prices and salaries,  and both will lose money. Perhaps by being the first firm to enter I 'scare off the other firm' and I can keep the profits. The other firm may 'threaten to enter' but that would seem to be a non-credible threat! On the other hand, suppose that I know that if I enter first the other firm can 'learn from my mistakes' and free-ride off my innovation. Here we would have a 'second-mover advantage'; but in such a game a BWI may lead to the outcome 'neither firm enters'!

```
\

These concerns also apply to politics, and the games can of course include multiple players (this was from  2018... can you think of comparable examples from 2019-20?)

- Cameron's decision to allow a referendum, followed by politician's (Boris etc) decisions to choose a side?

- May's negotiations with the EU (Barnier), followed by the parliament's 'meaningful vote', followed by ??

- US Supreme court fight over Brett Kavanaugh, the sequential decisions of the last 'swing' senators

-  [UCU decision to declare and continue a strike, USS decision to award pay increases commensurate with inflation](https://exeterucu.wordpress.com/2019/10/26/strike-ballots-letter-to-students/)

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","BOS_sequential.png"))
```
\

Proper subgame
:     Part of the game tree including an initial decision not connected to another (in an oval or dashed lines) and everything branching out below it.

- I.e., each 'game' starting from a point where a player knows where he is (knows previous choices)


```{block2,  type='note'}
We can derive the *outcomes consistent with* SPNE via backwards induction. Essentially, SPNE simply requires that each players (choose strategies that specify) would act optimally at each of the point they might find themselves... i.e., at each of the decision nodes in the extensive form 'game tree.'.
```

\


Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE)
:     Strategies that form a Nash equilibrium on every proper subgame.

You can solve for the *outcomes consistent with this with 'backwards induction' (BWI)

Solve for best move for last decision node (proper subgame)

- Given these, solve for best response for previous decision node

- Etc.

\

Example: BWI for *Sequential* Battle of the Sexes


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosbwi1.png"))
```


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosbwi2.png"))
```

Note that the SPNE in a sequential game always involves 'best responses'. I think this makes SPNE more credible as a prediction in sequential games than NE in simultaneous games.


\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","bosbwi1.png"))
```
\

*Next we can formally the specify (SP)NE strategies for the above game:*

NE, not SP: \{Wife: Boxing; Husband: Boxing, Boxing\}

\

SPNE:  \{Wife: Ballet; Husband: Ballet, Boxing\}


*(reading Husband's decision nodes left to right; please specify this)*


\


**It can get fancier**

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","longgamework_randompayoffs_noul.png"))
```


*Note: you can 'build these games' on \url{http://gte.csc.liv.ac.uk/gte/builder/} if you like*

\


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","longgamework_randompayoffs_ul.png"))
```

\

In 'normal' (matrix form), stating complete contingent strategies:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","longgame_matrix_full.png"))
```


<br> \bigskip

And the 'abbreviated strategies'; leaving out decision nodes ruled out by a player's own previous choices as specified in the strategy:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","longgame_matrix_abbrev.png"))
```


\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","longgamework_randompayoffs_ul.png"))
```

The SPNE; 'state the complete contingent strategies'

A: S1, N3, N5

B: s2, n4, n6

<br> \bigskip

...

Where actions are stated in the order of the decision nodes for each player


## Repeated games

### Definite time horizon {-}

- Is there a way in which we can sustain cooperation in a finitely repeated Prisoners’ Dilemma?
    - No.


\

Suppose we repeat the Prisoners’ Dilemma a finite (T) number of times, e.g., 10 times.

<br> <br> \bigskip


What is the subgame perfect equilibrium?

Via Backwards Induction (BWI) :
    - In period 10 (period T) both players confess as it's the dominant strategy
    - In period 9 (period T-1)
        - Knowing period 10 (period T) decision is unaffected by earlier moves, players confess in period 9 (their dominant strategy)
    - ... etc, all the way back to period 1


<br> <br> \bigskip
Thus each player will Confess in every period.  Not possible to sustain cooperation.


## Trigger strategies

Trigger strategy
:     Strategy in a repeated game where one player stops cooperating in order to punish another player for not cooperating.


Grim trigger strategy
:     If the other player fails to cooperate in one period, play the (undominated) action that makes her worse off in all later periods


## Repeated Games: Indefinite or infinite time horizon


- Game is played repeated for a potentially infinite number of periods
- But there is a 'discount factor' $g$
    - $g$ may represent the 'probability the game is repeated another time'

Note: With an infinitely-repeated game with no discounting, payoffs would be potentially infinite, making it hard to decipher.\
 It's realistic to imagine people discount the future, and we don't know how long these repeated interactions last; people die, move away, etc.

\

*At this point it is worth a quick revision of what 'discount factors' mean.* This is a basic concept in economics an finance. It is covered briefly in NS chapter 7 under 'present discounted value'.

\

There are some debates over whether it makes sense to 'discount utility'... we can see this discounting as an easy notation in these repeated games

\


**Indefinitely repeated Prisoners' Dilemma**

Consider the following trigger strategy (for both players):

- Stay silent as long as the other player stays silent.
- If one player confesses, both players will confess from them on.
- Is this a SPNE?
    - In each subgame after someone confesses, we play confess in all stage games (forever on), which we know is a NE
    - What about periods where no one has confessed (yet)?


How do we know both players playing 'confess forever' is a SPNE?

Starting in any subgame, knowing the other player will confess, I will want to confess (for that period's payoffs).

I also know that given his strategy, playing 'silent' in  this period will not have any impact on my later payoffs.

\



The payoff from staying Silent (cooperating) each period is:

$$-2 \times (1 + g + g^2 + g^3 + ...  )$$



The payoff from Confessing right away (after which both players Confess always) is:

$$ -1 + -3 \times (g + g^2 + g^3 + ... ) $$

<br> <br> \bigskip

Formula for a geometric series (where $0<g<1$): $g + g^2 +  g^3 + g^4 ... = g/(1-g)$

Note on Maths: The standard derivation of this, which is pretty neat, is in the text.\
This formula is an important one in economics (and beyond), particularly for discounting a constant stream of payoffs, e.g., stock dividends

\

Thus cooperation in a single period is 'weakly preferred' (at least as good) if

$$(-2) \times (1 + g + g^2 + g^3 + <br> <br> \bigskip ) \geq (-1) + -3 \times (g + g^2 + g^3 + ...)$$

<br> <br> \bigskip

$$g + g^2 + g^3 + ... \geq 1$$

Note on intuition for the second formula: left side is loss of future payoffs (-3 vs -2 forever from next period). \
 Right side is gain in that period (get -1 rather than -2))

\

$$g/(1-g) \geq 1$$

\

$$g \geq \frac{1}{2}$$


<br> <br> \bigskip


So, cooperation can be sustained as long as the probability of play continuing is high enough; here, above 1/2.

NOTE: Just because it can be sustained doesn't mean it will be; there are other Subgame-Perfect Nash equilibria, including 'always confess'.

NOTE: This setup is directly applied to the case of 'a cartel' of firms tacitly or overtly colluding to sustain high prices!

## Continuous Actions


\

**Game theory applied to cases where people choose 'continuous' actions**

- Firms choose a price or quantity of a product, or a level of R\&D, etc.
- Households voluntarily contribute to a local public good (e.g., neighborhood watch), or choose how many fish to catch from the shared pond
- Nations decide how large an army to build
- $\rightarrow$ Payoff functions, continuous 'best response functions'; rather than a payoff matrix

- Nash equilibrium: Again, choices that are best responses to one another
- Dominant strategies: Again, a strategy that is preferred against *any* other player(s)' strategies


Note: Here the iterated dominance or 'rationalizability' is harder to compute; I may not have time to cover this (but I may add this as a supplement for those interested.)

\

A general method for finding NE foe continuous games with differentiable payoffs, finding NE:**

1. Write down payoff functions. (Differentiable? If not it becomes more difficult.)

2. Maximise each player’s payoff with respect to own strategy; the other player's payoff are a fixed 'parameter' here $\rightarrow$ Players' best-response functions.

3. Look for intersection(s) $\rightarrow$ Nash equilibrium (equilibria)

<br>  \bigskip

Source: https://www3.nd.edu/~tjohns20/gametheory_SP13/slides3.pdf}

<br>  \bigskip


With two players:

$$s_i^\ast=B_i(B_-i(s_i^\ast))$$

If the game is symmetric this is a 'fixed point'.



\

### Tragedy of the Commons {-}

Shepherds A and B raise $s_A$ and $s_B$ sheep, respectively, in the same meadow

- More sheep graze $\rightarrow$ the less grass for each, thus less wool/milk/meat per sheep

<br> \bigskip

Benefit from each sheep raised: $120-s_A-s_B$

<br> \bigskip

Total benefit from raising $s_A$ and $s_B$ sheep:

- Shepherd A:	$s_A(120-s_A-s_B)$
- Shepherd B:	$s_B(120-s_A-s_B)$

<br> \bigskip

Marginal benefit of 'me adding' another sheep:

- Shepherd A:	$120-2s_A-s_B$
- Shepherd B:	$120-s_A-2s_B$


\

For simplicity, assume zero marginal cost

\

Set the marginal benefit equal to the marginal cost (here zero)

- Shepherd A:	$120-2s_A-s_B = 0$
- Shepherd B:	$120-s_A-2s_B = 0$


<br> \bigskip

Rearrange the above to solve for the best response functions

- Shepherd A:	 $s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$
- Shepherd B:	 $s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A$


\

Solve for the Nash equilibrium:


$$s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$$

<br> \bigskip

Plug this value of $s_A$ into the BRF for B and solve for $s_B$, then for $s_A$

$$s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A = 60 - \frac{1}{2}(60-\frac{1}{2} s_B)$$


$s_A* = s_B* = 40$


\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","brsheep.png"))
```

- Shepherd A:	 $s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$

- Shepherd B:	 $s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A$
- $\rightarrow s_A* = s_B* = 40$


\

**Why the “Tragedy” of the Commons?**

*Some examples...*


- Firms choose a price or quantity of a product, or a level of R\&D, etc.
- Households voluntarily contribute to a local public good (e.g., neighborhood watch), or choose how many fish to catch from the shared pond
- Nations decide how large an army to build

$\rightarrow$ Payoff functions, continuous 'best response functions'; rather than a payoff matrix


\

<br> <br> \bigskip

To maximise *total* payoffs we set $S=s_A+s_B$ to maximise
$$S\times(120-S)$$

<br> <br> \bigskip

Concave problem, set first-derivative to zero:
$$120 - 2S = 0 \rightarrow S^*=60$$

<br> <br> \bigskip

Leading to total payoff $60 \times (120 - 60) = 3600$.
- If they split this evenly (each graze 30), they get 1800 each.
- This is the 'continuous' action analogy of the Prisoner's dilemma

- If split evenly (each graze 30), get 1800 each.
- This is the 'continuous' action analogue of Prisoner's dilemma



Note that both the PD and the above 'tragedy of the commons' game illustrate a similar point:
 Individuals acting in their own private interest may end up each doing worse off than if they could cooperate or collude.

\

*Sadly, this problem (literally!) is still relevant.*  See, e.g., ["Morocco: Managing the 'commons' Livestock and Pasture Development Project in the Eastern Region"]({http://www.ifad.org/evaluation/public_html/eksyst/doc/profile/pn/morocco.htm)


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","moroccansheep.jpg"))
```

### "Strategic complements" and "strategic substitutes" {-}

\

The slope of these 'best response functions' tells you whether the two players 'choice variables' (above, sheep) are **Strategic complements** or **Strategic substitutes**.



(Of course, we can also have 'strategic heterogeneity'... strategic substitutes starting from some points, some combinations of strategies in the 'strategy space'  strategic complements starting from other points.)

\

... Continuous Action games...

- Allow us to see how the equilibrium shifts as we change one 'parameter'
    - E.g., increase A's benefit per sheep
- We call this 'comparative statics analysis'
- See example in NS text

\


Another practice problem: 'Cournot competition' (see problem 13 in Mock exam)

\

Examples with strategic complements: Bertrand competition, the 'matching game' in [Gall and Reinstein's "Losing Face"](http://www2.ku.edu/~kuwpaper/2014Papers/201408.pdf) ... there's a nice discussion in [Games with Strategic Complements and Substitutes - Monaco and Sabarwal](http://www2.ku.edu/~kuwpaper/2014Papers/201408.pdf).

## Experimental evidence: What is a laboratory experiment in Economics?

E.g., FEELE lab at Exeter

- Real incentives (typically small)
- Typically student subject pool
- No deception protocol

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","expeconlab.jpg"))
```

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","ztreePD.png"))
```

\

### Various experimental goals {-}

- Measure preferences (risk, time, social preferences...)
- Asses theoretical predictions (classical and behavioural), including game theory
    - Also see 'likely' outcomes where theory has no prediction or predicts multiple equilibria
    - *Critical* to assert 'control' over payoffs for this
- Understand cognitive processes in economic realm
- 'Test' institutions and mechanisms (e.g., auctions, markets)

## Laboratory evidence 1: Prisoners' dilemmas

Cooper et al (1996)

- Players cooperated even in anonymous 'one-shot' games (different opponents each time)
- Cooperation declines somewhat over time, but not to zero
- Mix of other-regarding and selfish types

*Notes:* Results are similar for experiments involving contributions to public goods.some cooperation, declining over time but not to zero, and a mix of players who never contribute and many 'reciprocal' types.

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","cooperPD.png"))
```

## Laboratory evidence 2: Ultimatum game
- Proposer goes first, proposes a split of the 'pie', anything between 0\%-100\% and 100\%-0\% inclusive.
- Responder can accept or reject and get nothing


Q: What does SPNE predict (use backwards induction)?


Ans: It predicts the proposal offers the lowest (positive) amount and the responder accepts


<br> <br> \bigskip


What happens in experiments?

- 50-50 split is the most common offer
- Responders tend to reject offers giving them less than 30\%, even when this is a lot of money


Potential explanations

- Fairness concerns; monetary payoffs may not represent actual payoffs
- Proposers may anticipate this



## Issues in lab experiments

### What is being measured? {-}
- PD: Does money measure the true payoffs? Do we have the 'control' to test the model?
    - Other-regarding preferences; may be unobservable.
    - 'Experimenter demand': desire to please experimenter, aware of study goals?


## Issues in lab experiments: External generalisability
- Relevance of subject-pool (participants)
    - Do they resemble the 'real world' group of interest? (e.g., firms, countries, taxpayers, voters, home-buyers)
    - Right preferences and experience?
- Relevance of environment
    - Are the (small) stakes relevant?
    - Are the right 'environmental characteristics' present?
    - Does the 'imposed model' apply?
    - Observed self-conscious environment, perhaps made aware of contrasts




[comment]: <> (101BB)

*Supplementary reading:*

I highly recommend you look over some of the literature on how game theoretic predictions/concepts are considered and tested.  Some suggestions:

- 'Ten Little Treasures of Game Theory and Ten Intuitive Contradictions' Goeree and Holt, 2001

- Skim or read the introduction of any of the 'Handbooks' like 'Handbook of Experimental Economics'

Meta-analysis papers like:

- Oosterbeek, Hessel, Randolph Sloof, and Gijs Van De Kuilen. "Cultural differences in ultimatum game experiments: Evidence from a meta-analysis." Experimental economics 7.2 (2004): 171-188 or

- Johnson, Noel D., and Alexandra A. Mislin. "Trust games: A meta-analysis." Journal of Economic Psychology 32.5 (2011): 865-889.


I also advise looking at recent 'replication' and 'many labs' project work; there are now more systematic attempts to get robust evidence on which patterns and effects are 'real' and which were a 'lucky draw' or 'publication bias'.  This also applies to our later discussion of behavioral economics.

\

Another fairly readable and extremely influential (theory) paper, extending this to games of incomplete (asymmetric) information :

- Spence, M. (1973): 'Job market signaling,' The Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 87, pp. 355-374.
