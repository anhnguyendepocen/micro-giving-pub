# Supplement: What determines which charity people donate to? Are they in competition?

## Charity: Does one contribution come at the expense of another? (Evidence, theoretical framework, empirical and experimental issues)


*"To what extent does an individual's contribution to one cause\ come at the expense of his or her other philanthropy?"*


- What does this question mean?

- Why is it important/ who cares?

- How can we observe this?

- What factors determine a potential donor's choice over a range of charities?


## What does this question mean?

- Standard framework: "Gifts to Cancer Research UK" and "Gifts to Oxfam" (or to these *causes*) arise out of a joint optimization; one doesn't "respond" to the other

    - Prices and external changes can shift each, but we cannot "force you to voluntarily give" in a meaningful way

    - If we *could* shift $\rightarrow$ apply theory of Conditional Demand (Pollak) $\rightarrow$ "expenditure substitution"

    - "Prices" unclear in this context, depends on model of benefits of giving, rarely vary exogenously

\

Simpler question: Does a typical "promotion for CRUK" cause more or less giving to Oxfam?

- More difficult: Is the causality...

\


"CRUK promo" $\rightarrow$

\


"give more to CRUK"


\


$\rightarrow$ give less (more) to Oxfam

???


- Hard to rule out *direct* effects of promo

("mediation analysis" is difficult; -- see Heckman's work on this)





- And do we want to include or exclude the impact of "less money remains to spend"

(Pollak calls this the 'money-income' effect; it is distinct from  the 'income effect' in the standard Slutsky decomposition.)


\


## Why is it important/ who cares?

- Moral issue for individuals, fundraisers, charities `r format_with_col("('am I really increasing the pie?')","gray")`

- Practical issue for charity managers, charity networks, governments (tax, choice of charities to tax-favor)

    - Public statements vs strategic plans

- Intellectual: differentiates models and general understanding of other-regarding preferences and behavior

```{block2,  type='note'}
My impression is (get or recover references) that charities publicly claim that the sector does not compete, there is 'learned giving', etc.
but privately their fundraising strategies assume they are in competition for the same charity dollar.)
```

**Theoretical predictions**

Reinstein (2010) defines ''Expenditure substitution''

- Conditional expenditure (Sugden; Pollak) response in one charity to a change in a preallocation of another charity.

^[Todo for paper, minimally here: recap precise definition of Expenditure Substitution from Reinstein, compare to others' related models]

^[Note that if I care only about the total amount of the PG, the crowding out of 'my previous giving' should be the same as for others' or for government spending, plus the money-income effect (less remaining after my prev donation).]

## Literature  II:\ Lab Experiments


\

### Lab in-group dictator games and VCMs {-}

$||X||\rightarrow\infty$

^[So many of these!]

- Andreoni and Miller (2002): GARP/WARP violations and price sensitivity of gifts

- Fisman, Kariv, and Markovits (2005): Advances A&M,estimates utility function, classifies by types

    - Substitution patterns in gifts to multiple other lab participants and oneself

- Krieg and Samek (2014):  Two simultaneous PGG with two different groups.

    - KS find complementarities: giving for both PGs increases with a bonus for giving to one of these

\

### Lab tests of competition/crowding out, involving real charitable giving {-}

- Several on crowding out of 'government spending', others' gifts

^[Andreoni (1993), Bolton and Katok (1998), Eckel, Grossman, and Johnston (2004) (in-group[?]), Crumpler and Grossman (2006) (out-group) [recheck these]]

**Reinstein (2005 experiment, WP dated 2012): first direct investigation of...**

- Direct/indirect effects of treatments (choice sets, matches/price, information/promotion) on own and other charity

- Inferring "Expenditure substitution" of one gift for another (same or different category)

- Mainly between-subject variation (randomized choice set orderings)

- Multiple sequential choices in same experiment, random-lottery-incentive

- Lab experiment, convenience sample

- 33\% of subjects have a relatively 'fixed purse': total giving varying less than 25\% between stages

^[Todo - Return to data: can we correlate this with particular demography and psych characteristics? Prior givers especially?]

- But we can generally reject 'complete crowding out' (in key regressions)

**Harwell et al. (2015, mimeo)**

- Resembles a simpler Reinstein (2005/2012)

1. Standard lab subject donate or keep any amount among 3 charities
2. Video-based campaign and "challenge" for one of the 3 charities
3. Repeat donation decision.


\


$\rightarrow$ Campaign for one charity "fully crowds out giving to the other charities without changing the total donations"


^[To do: look closer at design, statistical analysis and findings; Power to reject full-crowding? RLI?]

> In all cases, the campaign succeeded in increasing donations to the target organization;
> but, in all cases, total donations remained unchanged.


^[Finds expenditure substitution, as in Reinstein, but in contrast, complete crowding-out]

**Ek (2017) "...The Effect of Similarity on Substitution..."**

- Lab experiment, Swedish students, 42\% Business/Econ majors



<!---
Abstract: Donation matching and other directed interventions to encourage prosocial contributions may affect contributions through other channels. In an experimental dictator game where subjects may donate to two different real-world charities, we simulate activity-specific interventions by varying the relative productivity of those charities, and introduce several treatments to test whether (i) subjects substitute across charities, and (ii) whether substitution occurs even across (possibly very) dissimilar alternatives. We find that significant substitution occurs in all cases, but that the effect is weaker the more dissimilar the charity alternatives. In our most dissimilar treatment, substitution is only half as large as when alternatives are very similar.

\

*Design*

20 EUR (approx) show-up fee

- In each of 5 rounds (RLI) ...

1. Learn "exchange rates" for each charity (Unicef always about 1 Eur/point)

2. Can do "Slider Adjustment Task" for 120 seconds to earn points

3. Can allocate points earned among the 2 charities
    - Cannot *keep* the money (could only avoid doing sliders) (Why?)

- Exchange rates for non-Unicef charity randomly drawn in each stage, *without* replacement, from 4, 8, 10, 12, and 16

^[In typical experiments, participants do about 27 sliders in 2 minutes. Depending on the exchange rate, this should imply between about 10-40 Euros typically at stake?]

^[Note they've a sixth round with exchange rate of 16 for both, but they don't discuss it much]

^[Give less (basically lower share, as earnings are similar) to UNICEF when other charity is 'cheaper'
And slope is steeper (confirmed in regressions) when paired with a similar charity;
much shallower when paired with charity that is dissimilar along othb dimensions ]

^[Todo: Think about, look closer into whether this difference holds for people at the intensive margin (give to both).]

## Lit. III:\ Field evidence (field and natural experiments, observational results)

\

### Observational (PSID) results (Reinstein, 2010) {-}

<br> \bigskip

Data: 2001-2007 waves of the PSID/COPPS  (annual then biennial), recall survey, loosely-defined cause categories

- Households that give more to one type of charity tend to give more to others.

- But many negative significant correlations between residuals from fixed-effects regressions

    - Esp. for larger (prior) donors and for certain paired cause categories

- Plausible econometric assumptions $\rightarrow$ negative correlations are strong evidence of expenditure substitution

- Interpretation: heterogeneous motivations for giving, small vs large givers

^[Small donors may be mainly driven by temporary shocks and personal appeals, larger givers may have concave multi-charity warm-glow preferences.
 This broadly agrees with findings from Dellavigna et al; and Karlan and McConnell]

 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","distinctcat_resid_psid.png"))
```

<br> \bigskip

*(Reinstein, 2010)*

\

### Disasters: {-}

- Deryugina & Marx (15, WP): Tax filings data, disaster data (USA)

    - Result: Donations in a state affected by a tornado (causing 10+ injuries) increase by 1.7-2\% in that year and 1.9-2\% percent in the 2 years after

    - Argue evidence against (complete) crowding out

\

Scharf ea. (15, unfinished):

- Data from Charities Aid Foundation covering 130,000 individual charity accounts from June 2009-July 2014, observe donation amounts, dates..

- During this time, 6 'major disasters', UKDEC initiated major appeals

*Results*

- Increase in giving after disaster appeal, no reduced giving to international relief later on

- 'Fail to reject zero substitution' of all other charity, with 'precisely estimated' effects

    - Except for health

    - Giving to *all* charities, even unrelated ones, seems to increase in the 5 weeks after disaster, but then decrease in weeks 6-13

^["Second, for the most part the large increase in giving to international relief does not come at the expense of giving to other charitable purposes. Looking at the effect of disaster appeals to donations to the combination of all other charitable purposes (except international relief), we fail to reject zero substitution. The failure to reject zero substitution is not due to large standard errors, but rather effects that are close to zero and precisely estimated. When we look within the “all other” category at more narrowly defined charitable purposes, we also fail to reject zero substitution in all but one case. Giving to health charities is the one case we cannot reject zero substitution, and even there the magnitude of substitution is small. Third, although the substitution we find between international relief and other)
charitable purposes is statistically indistinguishable from zero (excepting health), we see that the disaster appeals are associated with a behavioural response in giving to other charitable purposes, but the response is a shift in the timing of giving to other purposes. That is, the disaster appeals have an effect on giving to other charitable purposes, but the effect is time-shifting, not substitution.]


<!---
At the other end of the other spectrum, Lange and Stocking (2012) provide a field experiment and show that complementarities exist in the competition between charities. In particular, donor list exchanges between rival charities may increase charitable donations."
-->


### Lange & Stocking (12) {-}
<!-- (Todo: add notes on this paper) -->

### Natural expt: Meer (17) {-}

- Matching campaigns at DonorsChoose.org increases (likelihood of, amount of) funding for one project

    - But no significant impact on donations to other projects

^[Todo: Recheck more closely, consider context, statistical power, potential for crowding out]


### Donkers et al, Field experiment (2016) {-}

- Access to databases of 5 largest charities in NL

- Targeting 'extra mailings' to existing donors

- all sent in one week (cf, donors to all 5 typically get 1 mailing every 2 weeks)

*Results*


<!---
Access to the databases of five large charity organizations in the Netherlands, containing names and addresses of their donors. This enables us to create a unique dataset of direct mailings and (possible) donations at the individual level. Two charities are concerned with the health sector, two charities with the international aid sector and one charity with the social welfare sector. Our dataset covers mailings and donations during more than three and a half years, from January 2004 until August 2007,
-->
<!---
e, we only select previous donators of each charity to receive experimental mailings of that charit
-->

<!---
Each charity sends at most one experimental mailing to each individual in addition to the regular mailing campaigns that are scheduled throughout the year. The experimental mailings are extra mailings as compared to the charities’ regular mailing strategies and the charities agreed (after our consultation) not to adjust their mailing strategies in response to the experimental mail
-->


<!---
… treatment conditions [vary]  the number of experimental mailings that subjects will receive. Each charity sends at most one experimental mailing to each individual in addition to the regular mailing campaigns that are scheduled throughout the year. The experimental mailings are extra mailings as compared to the charities’ regular mailing strategies… we selected a week in which no regular mailings were planned by the five charities.
... our field experiment consists of sending 21,000 mailings to a total of 9000 subjects.
...Control group, we select 12,000 subjects who will not receive additional mailings, consisting of 2400 subjects from each ‘number of active charities’ condition.
We have access to the databases of five large charity organizations in the Netherlands,  … [focus on ‘active’ donors]
… we need a model-based analysis that controls for the large heterogeneity in donating behavior across donors and across charities. In fact, economically meaningful effect sizes could easily be swamped by the amount of predictable variation that is present in our data.
-->

 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","donkers_mailings.png"))
```

\

**Results**

*Direct:* each experimental mailing generates 1.81 Euro in revenues, on average, so the short-run impact of mailings is positive.


\


<br> \bigskip

*Cannibalization, net:* Each mailing lowers future revenues by 1.21 Euros, representing a 62% loss of the initial gain ...the net revenues of 0.69 Euro is still statistically significant.


\


*Competition*


\


<br> \bigskip

Extensive margin:  -0.36\% impact of a competitive mailing (cf predicted response rate of 13.39%)

Combined margins: reduction of 0.10 Euros for an additional competitive mailing (cf 2.41 Euros baseline)
    - 10\% summed effect on all competitors

\

Long run: 5 months

- Sending an extra mailing on top of the current mailing strategy reduces the total future donation with around €1.51
    -Still positive effect in net of 1.81-1.51=0.30; significant?

- Competition - not significant (but wide std error $\rightarrow$ little power to detect

- Marketing policy suggestions...

^[Cannibalization is estimated to be about 63\%, so mailings are profitable for the charity as long as the costs are lower than 37% of the revenues
  or about 0.90 Euro. Accounting for sector-level effects, there is an additional loss of 10% of the revenues through competitive effects.
 The costs of a mailing should there- fore not exceed 27\% of revenues, which is about 0.65 Euro.
[cf actual mailing cost of 0.51 Euro], charities can still send out more mailings to increase their own revenues,
 without harming the total amount of money available for the good causes that the charitable sector supports as a whole.]


\

## Synthesis, limits of previous evidence

- Still mixed and limited evidence

- Donkers ea provides the most powerful and relevant evidence, imho

    - But limited to a particular set of donors to multiple causes

    - Low-impact shock (extra mailing) to existing donors

    - Do not connect direct and indirect effects of mailings

    - Do not report on 'how closeness of charities matters'



## Reinstein and Riener, 2017 (WIP)

- Field experiment, registered AEA RCT registry

<br> \bigskip



Nonstudents (marketing list, local Colchester residents) get emails and letters:

1. Invited to sign up for ESSExLab and do short survey, \pounds10 reward

- "First (No) Ask treatment" at end of survey

2. If signed up, invited back after a delay to participate in Omnibus survey, \pounds10 reward

- "Second Ask" treatment at end of Omnibus survey

\

Nonstudents, first invitation email, includes language:

> We recently sent you a letter in the post inviting you to join the ESSEXLab participant database, which can also be found below.
> You have been randomly selected for a special reward for signing up - a £10 Amazon voucher!


\

Students (already ESSExLab participants) get email invitations:

1. To do Omnibus survey, \pounds10 reward

- "First (No) Ask treatment" at end of Omnibus survey

2. Do do another survey (about employability), \pounds10 reward

- "Second Ask" treatment at end


\


*First ask treatments (between-subject randomisation)*

1. No ask
2. Asked for Oxfam
3. Asked for British Heart Foundation

\

*Second ask treatments (between-subject randomisation, balance by first treatment)*


1. Asked for CRUK
2. Ask for Save the Children

*Charity choices; similar or distinct*

- Chosen based on UK prominence, potential to easily divide into disjoint similarity classes. (Ruled out charities with very similar names)

- We confirmed the similarity classes in a separate survey (via Prolific Academic on 4 March 2017) of a demographically-similar group (N=104).

    - Similarity was measured using both unincentivized and beauty-contest elicitation.

\

### Timing, samples {-}

1. Nonstudent invites first ask (ESSEXLab), staggered groups of $\approx$ 500

- 144 completed

^[4:11pm on 15 May. Note it's every 2 day, skipping weekend days. Also reminded ESSExLab-no-survey signups on 20 May)]

2. Nonstudent invites second ask (Omnibus)

- 25 May 3pm, reminder 2 June 10am

- 97 completed (33\% 'attrition')


\

1. Student invites first ask (Omnibus)

- Invitation 1 June 3:02pm

- 6 June, treatment switched to 'earn \pounds10 for sure'

- Final reminder 15 June

- 227 completed, 223 valid

2. Student invites second ask (Employment survey)

- Invite 27 June 3pm

- Final reminder 10 July

- 144 completed (35\% 'attrition')

\

### Results (very preliminary, see Stata) {-}

- Strong crowding-out, cannot rule out perfect crowding out
- No evidence that similar charities crowd each other out more
    - Need to examine further

- Evidence of selective attrition for nonstudents
