\section*{Our Philosophy}

\emph{\booktitle: \booksubtitle} focuses upon the material that students need to cover in a first introductory course. It is slightly more compact than the majority of principles books in the Canadian marketplace. Decades of teaching experience and textbook writing has led the authors to avoid the encyclopedic approach that characterizes the recent trends in textbooks.

Consistent with this approach, there are no appendices or `afterthought' chapters. If important material is challenging then it is still included in the main body of the text; it is not relegated elsewhere for a limited audience; the text makes choices on what issues and topics are important in an introductory course. This philosophy has resulted in a Micro book of just 15 chapters, of which Chapters~\ref{chap:intro} through \ref{chap:classical} plus Chapter~\ref{chap:internationaltrade} are common to both Micro and Macro.

Examples are domestic and international in their subject matter and are of the modern era -- consumers buy iPods, snowboards and jazz, not so much coffee and hamburgers. Globalization is a recurring theme.

The title is intended to be informative. Students are introduced to the concepts of models early, and the working of such models is illustrated in every chapter. Calculus is avoided; but students learn to master and solve linear models. Hence straight line equations.

\section*{Structure of the Text}

\emph{\booktitle: \booksubtitle} provides a concise, yet complete, coverage of introductory microeconomic theory, application and policy in a Canadian and global environment. Our beginning is orthodox: We explain and develop the standard tools of analysis in the discipline.

Economic policy is about the well-being of the economy's participants, and economic theory should inform economic policy. So we investigate the meaning of `well-being' in the context of an efficient use of the economy's resources early in the text.

We next develop an understanding of individual optimizing behaviour. This behaviour in turn is used to link household decisions on savings with firms' decisions on production, expansion and investment. A natural progression is to explain production and cost structures.

From the individual level of household and firm decision making, the text then explores behaviour in a variety of different market structures.

Markets for the inputs in the productive process -- capital and labour -- are a natural component of firm-level decisions. But education and human capital are omnipresent concepts and concerns in the modern economy, so we devote a complete chapter to them.

The book then examines the role of a major and important non-market player in the economy -- the government, and progresses to develop the key elements in the modern theory of international trade.

Opportunity cost, a global economy and behavioural responses to incentives are the dominant themes.
