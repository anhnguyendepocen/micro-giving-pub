{\normalfont Output is produced by the factors of production -- land, labour and capital. In Chapter~\ref{chap:marketlabourcapital} we explore how the markets for these factors, or productive inputs, operate. We focus primarily on labour and capital.

Chapter~\ref{chap:humancapital} deals with human capital -- a broader concept than labour. The human capital embodied in a person depends upon her skills, education and experience, and this combination determines the rewards, or return, she obtains when employed.}
