\begin{FigureBox}{0.3}{0.25}{25em}{Long run and short run average costs \label{fig:longshortavg}}{The long-run $ATC$ curve, $LATC$, is the lower envelope of all short-run $ATC$ curves. It defines the least cost per unit of output when all inputs are variable. Minimum efficient scale is that output level at which the $LATC$ is a minimum, indicating that further increases in the scale of production will not reduce unit costs.}
