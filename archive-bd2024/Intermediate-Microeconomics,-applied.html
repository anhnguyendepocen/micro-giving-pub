<p><em>Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study)</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understand what ‘utility’ is and how is it defined and modeled</li>
<li>Understand the assumptions economists usually make about preferences (choices) and their implications</li>
<li>Learn how to depict preferences and utility with ‘indifference curves’ and how to interpret these
<ul>
<li>… with examples like ‘perfect substitutes’ and ‘perfect complements’</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Learn what ‘budget constraints’ are and how to compute and model them</li>
<li>Understand ‘maximising utility subject to constraints’
<ul>
<li>and the conditions for optimisation involving price ratios and marginal rates of substitution</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Learn how to depict this optimisation in a graph with indifference curves and budget constraints

<p><em>Note: Part 2 (ch 2-3) involves building the demand curve from first principles, and discussing how to interpret it</em></p>
<p><em>Notes:</em>
We want to develop a model that can be used to show how we make choices or decisions.</p>
<p>In the (neo) classical economics framework, your (optimising) choices are determined by two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Preferences: what goods do you like?</p></li>
<li><p>Constraints: how much money do you have, what are the prices of the goods you buy?</p></li>

<p><font color='RawSienna'>Adv: There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature </font></p>
<p><font color='RawSienna'>Adv: A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated, thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, ‘utility’, which is maximised.</font></p>

<p><span class="math display">\[Utility = U(X,Y; other)\]</span></p>
<p>We can get a lot of insight from considering models Of an individual’s preferences over only two goods. These two ‘goods’ could represent, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leisure and ‘goods consumption’</p></li>

<p><span class="math inline">\(U(X,Y)\)</span> must take <em>some</em> value for every positive value of X and Y.</p>
<p>In <em>general</em> a function of X and Y might increase or decrease in either X or Y, or increase over some ranges and decrease over other ranges of these two arguments.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.4</span> Measuring and comparing utilities</h2>
<p><font color='RawSienna'>Adv: This is a difficult but well-studied issue, as it is important for methodology and welfare analysis. In more detailed discussions, we might speak of ‘cardinal utility’, ‘ordinal utility’, etc., to indicate the ways we can or cannot compare utility between individuals and in response to policy changes.</font></p>
<ul>
<li>Utility is not ‘observable and measurable in utils’</li>
</ul>
<p>Utility is seen to govern an individual’s <em>choices</em> and thus it’s only inferred indirectly, from the <em>choices</em> people make</p>
<p><br> </p>

<p>Who gets ‘more’ utility? We don’t know.</p>
<p>Also, considering a transfer from Al to Betty: Is the reduction in Al’s utility more or less than the increase in Betty’s?</p>
<p><em>Revealed preference:</em> if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a dog was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat.</p>
<p>As we only get at utility through an <em>individual’s</em> decisions, we have no reliable way to compare it across individuals.</p>

Act this out? Make a video?

<p><br> </p>
<p>In more detail…</p>
<p>Intuitively: Transitive preferences are ‘internally consistent’: If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Loosely, I might expect this if I think that a person has preferences that can be ranked in a normal way. The standard ‘utility framework’ takes this for granted. If we have any rule over preference such as ‘more is better’ or ‘tastier is better’, this should hold. Also, someone whose makes choices following preferences that are not transitive may quickly be impoverished by a shrewd trader. We do not see this happening in general.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>If you found someone who strictly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them. This is easiest to illustrate if we allow these goods to be non-discrete and assume ‘more is always better.’</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>It works as follows:</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of banana (or ‘money’).</p></li>
<li><p>Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra.</p></li>
<li><p>Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>… Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you’ve drained all of their resources.</p>
<p><font color='gray'>(Final) Exam question: What are ‘transitive preferences’? Give an example of a person making choices that seem to reflect preferences that are extit{not} transitive, and explain how you could ‘pump money’ from this person.</font><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>### 3. More is better (‘global nonsatiation’)</p>
<p><img src="moreisbetter.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Perhaps this seems unreasonable? One way you might justify it: If the product is a ‘bad’ (e.g., pollution), redefine the product as the <em>absence</em> of the product.</p>
<p>The darkly shaded area above represents those combinations of X and Y that are unambiguously preferred to the combination X*, Y*.
This is why goods are called ‘goods’; individuals prefer having more of any good rather than less.
Combinations of X and Y in the lightly shaded area are inferior to the combination <span class="math inline">\(X^{\ast}, Y^{\ast}\)</span>,
whereas those in the questionable areas may or may not be superior to <span class="math inline">\(X^{\ast}, Y^{\ast}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-cares" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.3</span> Who cares?</h3>
<p><strong>If people obey the first two above assumptions/axioms, the completeness and transitivity<span class="math inline">\(\ast\)</span>, they will make choices in a way consistent with maximising a (continuous) <em>utility</em> function.</strong> (… OK, maybe you still don’’t care, but economists do.)</p>
<p><font color='gray'>(<span class="math inline">\(st\)</span>technically, we also require something called ‘continuity’, which also yields continuous utility and demand curves that don’t have jumps, but we won’t discuss this).</font></p>
<p><font color='RawSienna'>Strictly, most results only require ‘local nonsatiation’; starting from any consumption point, increasing the amount of <em>some</em> good by a tiny epsilon amount will yield a preferred point. This will yield results like ‘people will spend all of their wealth’ and ‘(roughly) people will never buy a more expensive bundle when a cheaper bundle is preferred.’</font></p>
<p>We are not saying people <em>actually</em> consult a utility function. That would be a dumb thing to say.
We are considering that ‘people behave as if they are maximizing utility functions’;
this is (basically) equivalent to saying "people choose based on preferences that satisfy the above assumptions.</p>
<p>These axioms stand directly behind ‘revealed preference’ methods for measuring how much people value
nonmarket goods, like clean air and national parks.
It also gives us a vocabulary and a way to test for violations of this consistency, and make alternate predictions.</p>

<p>Even though these concepts are rather abstract, we can already apply this to an interesting question that has been central to economics throughout history.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there ‘voluntary trade’ (between individuals)?</strong></p>
<p>This gives us insight into why people trade with one another.</p>
<p>Considering figure 2.2 (above and in the NS text), an individual is ok with giving up soda for hamburgers or vice/versa <em>along</em> her indifference curve. A trade that put her <em>above</em> the IC makes her ‘strictly’ better off.</p>
<p><em>So consider if one individual had allocation D and another allocation A, and they had the same preferences.</em> <font color='blue'>What trade could they make to make each of them better off?</font></p>

<p>The MRS measures the maximum amount of one good (<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>) that you would be willing to give up in order to gain one more unit of another good (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>).

<div id="utility-maximization" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.12</span> Utility maximization</h2>
<p>We started with an individual’s preferences, one of the baseline elements of the neoclassical model. Under some conditions these can be described by utility functions, which we depicted graphically as ‘mountains’ with levels sets depicted by indifference curves.</p>
<p>So, we have a way of depicting what people prefer, but this doesn’t tell us what people will <em>choose</em> to consume (and firms to produce).</p>
<p>We next introduced the second fundamental element of the neoclassical model, constraints, in particular, the budget constraint.</p>
<p>We put these together to describe the consumer’s problem: maximizing her utility subject to her budget constraints. this is depicted in figure 2.7 below for the two good case.</p>
<p><img src="utilmax.png" width="80%" height="2.4in" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Imagine that you are this consumer with these preferences and this budget constraint. You can choose any point in the shaded area, as it is on or below your budget constraint. You want to get to the highest indifference curve.</p>
<p><font color='blue'>Consider:</font> How do we know A is suboptimal (i.e., NOT optimal(? What about B? Points between B and C?</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>We can demonstrate that you will choose point C, yielding utility <span class="math inline">\(U_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>What is special about point C?</p>
<p>It’s the point of <em>tangency</em> between the budget constraint and an indifference <em>curve</em>.</p>
<p>It’s also (not a coincidence) the point where the slopes are equal.</p>

<p><font color='red'>Warning:</font> The above is shorthand; recall that the marginal rate of substitution may vary everywhere along an indifference curve (remember the idea of satiation and diminishing MRS). It is a function of the <em>point</em> it is evaluated, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(MRS = MRS(X,Y)\)</span>.

<p><strong>Example, for intuition</strong></p>
<p>Suppose that at the consumption bundle you choose your MRS = 1. To remain indifferent, you would be willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1 soda.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.12.2</span> More insight: Skip if you like</h3>
<p>This next bit is fairly mathy. It should be helpful but you can skip over it if you don’t find it so.</p>
<p>Recall <span class="math inline">\(U=U(X,Y)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U_X(X,Y) := MU_X(X,Y)\]</span></p>

<p><em>Derivative with respect to X: rate that utility increases if we add a little X, holding Y constant</em></p>
<p>Similarly for <span class="math inline">\(MU_Y\)</span>.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>It turns out the MRS at a point is the ratio of these marginal utilities.</p>
<p>MRS: ‘how much Y would I be willing to give up to get a unit of X’?</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each … we can show <span class="math inline">\(MRS(X,Y)=\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\)</span></p>
<p><em>Note:</em>
The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point – the higher is <span class="math inline">\(MU_X\)</span> – the more Y I am willing to give up to get it.
That is why <span class="math inline">\(MU_X\)</span> is in the numerator.</p>
<p>The more valuable a bit more Y is at that point – the higher is <span class="math inline">\(MU_Y\)</span> – the less Y I am willing to give up to get a bit more X. That is why <span class="math inline">\(MU_Y\)</span> is in the denominator.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color='RawSienna'>Advanced maths: The derivation of the MRS is optional material.</font></p>
<p>The ‘first order change in utility’ (or ‘total differential’) is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ dU  = \frac{\partial U}{\partial X}dX + \frac{\partial U}{\partial Y}dY\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Where <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial U}{\partial X}\)</span> refers to the partial derivative of U(X,Y) with respect to X, and similarly for Y, i.e., the marginal utility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, this approximates the total change in utility for very small changes in X and Y.
Setting it equal to zero and rearranging it yields the rate, at the margin, one is willing to give up Y for X:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[dU  = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY = 0 \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dY}{dX}=-\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\]</span></p>
<p><font color='RawSienna'>Adv: This is a simple case of the implicit function theorem, essentially <span class="math inline">\(U(X,Y)=c\)</span> defines an implicit function <span class="math inline">\(Y(X)\)</span>, whose slope is the negative of the ratio of the derivatives.</font></p>
<hr />
<p>Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields more intuition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y\]</span></p>
<p>(at each consumption point X,Y)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}.\]</span></p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>I.e., the same ‘bang for each buck’.</p>

<p>Yes, they are!</p>
<p>Recall the <a href="#perfect-sub-comp">definition of perfect substitutes</a>.</p>
<p>By ‘perfect substitutes’ we mean pairs of goods for which <em>some amount</em> of one is always valued the same as <em>some amount</em> of the other, and this proportion is always the same.</p>
<p>An easy example: I might always be indifferent between three pints of mild ale and two pints of strong ale, if they have the same total alcohol content and I only want to get tipsy.</p>
<p>So (for perfect substitutes) buy the one that increases it more <em>per-£.</em></p>
<p><font color='red'>Warning:</font> On the other hand, if goods are <em>not</em> perfect substitutes, margunal utility ratios (thus, marginal rates of substitution) generally depend on consumption levels.</p>

<li><span class="math inline">\(MU_X = 4\)</span>, so every additional unit of X will add four units of utility in this example, no matter what the starting point is.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(MU_Y = 3\)</span>, … so every unit of Y will add 3 units…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So <font color='red'>(for perfect substitutes)</font> the consumer will buy the one that increases utility more <em>per-£</em>

<li>Compare <span class="math inline">\(MU_X/P_X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(MU_Y/P_Y\)</span></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Demand functions</h2>
<p>Previously, we considered how consumption choices determined by utility functions/indifference curves and budget constraints. We can now consider how an individual’s choice of a good varies with each element of her budget constraint: for income and the price of each good.</p>
<p>We will refer to her ‘quantity demanded of good X’ function (or more simply, her ‘demand function’) as follows:</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Quantity \: of \: X \: demanded = d_x(P_X, P_Y, I; preferences)\]</span></p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(d_X(P_X,P_Y,I)\)</span> is homogenous of degree zero in its arguments.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Multiply all prices and income by the same amount, and the <em>budget constraint is unchanged.</em> Thus ( as preferences have not changed) consumption choices should not change either.</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g., the budget constraint <span class="math inline">\(P_X X + P_Y Y = I\)</span> is the same as the budget constraint <span class="math inline">\(2P_X X + 2P_Y Y = 2I\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Intuition for this:</em> Graphically, the budget line and indifference curves are unchanged, so her optimization problem is identical to the optimization problem before. The point of tangency between an indifference curve and her budget line is the same as before.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.10</span> App 3.2: The CPI and its biases</h2>
<p>The government (and many others) want to know ‘how much less (or more) is a pound this year than a pound in the past?’
One of the most prominent measures of this is the “consumer price index (CPI).”</p>
<p>The is a <em>very</em> important number: It is used for monetary policy (‘inflation targeting’) and for targeting many salaries and benefits. For example, my union is always raising the complaint that salaries have not risen in line with inflation. (But don’t worry, student fees have.)</p>
<p>Getting this number substantially and consistently wrong can lead to huge problems; people may be let into poverty or the government may be led into default. However, it is hard to get this measure right. Using the classical economics framework, we can consider what this means.</p>
<p>The UK uses a similar CPI measure to the USA (a change from the ‘RPI’ in 2003, although RPI is still used for some things). The Bank of England targets a 2% increase in the CPI per year.^[Something to know: what has been the inflation rate in recent years? This is an example of ‘market and industry knowledge’ that employers value. True, you can look this stuff up, but having a general sense of these things rolling around in your brain will ground your thinking. As an analogy, suppose you were a mariner navigating the seven seas and you had to go online every time to remember which direction was North or South.}</p>
<p><em>But does the CPI overstate the rate of inflation?</em></p>
<p>It is based on a ‘typical market basket’ (UK: of 700 different goods and services, excluding housing, updated yearly).</p>
<p><strong>1982 vs 2019 two-good example</strong></p>
<p>We can consider this with a minimal example, using only our two favourite goods, x and y.</p>
<p>Suppose in 1982 the “average household” consumed <span class="math inline">\(x_{82}\)</span> units of good x and <span class="math inline">\(y_{82}\)</span> units of good y.
The prices were <span class="math inline">\(p^x_{82}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p^y_{82}\)</span> for each of these, respectively.</p>
<p>Now in 2019 the average household consume <span class="math inline">\(x_{19}\)</span> units of good x and <span class="math inline">\(y_{19}\)</span> units of good y.
The prices are <span class="math inline">\(p^x_{19}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p^y_{18}\)</span> for each of these, respectively.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The expenditure (in pounds) in 1982 was thus <span class="math inline">\(b_{82}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{82}=p^x_{82}x_{82}+p^y_{82}y_{82}\]</span></p>
<p>How much would it cost to consume the “average 1982” basket today (2019), with today’s prices? … This is defined as <span class="math inline">\(b_{19}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{19}=p^x_{19}x_{82}+p^y_{19}y_{82}\]</span></p>
<p>The “regular” CPI will simply take the ratio of these two numbers:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[cpi_{19}=\frac{b_{19}}{b_{82}}\]</span></p>
<p>An unadjusted (Fixed-basket) CPI ‘claims’ you need <span class="math inline">\(I&#39;\)</span> to be as well off in 2019. I.e., to buy <em>the exact same basket</em>, including vinyl records. But, as seen in the figure below, by substituting you could be as well off with the lower level of income <span class="math inline">\(I&#39;&#39;\)</span> (And income <span class="math inline">\(I&#39;\)</span> would actually make you <em>better</em> off).</p>
<p><img src="cpi_bias.png" width="80%" height="2.7in" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>In fact, in setting policy, the basket <em>is</em> adjusted yearly, based on a survey of consumers’ spending. But even this is not necessarily the <em>right</em> adjustment, as consumers may be attaining higher or lower utility from these changes. The right adjustment depends on the consumers’ utility functions, which are unobservable.</p>

<p>Key to understanding the above example illustration: how do we see that the blue and red dot both <em>raise the same revenue</em>?</p>
<p>You could also compute these tax revenues algebraically and see they are the same (see footnote in NS textbook), but it is better to gain intuitive insight.</p>
<p>The revenue can be seen as the distance on the vertical axis, representing the value in terms of Y at the pre-tax price ratio.</p>
<p>This holds whether we measure it in terms of either commodity – you just have to pick one.</p>
<p>The tax revenue is the difference between the individual’s income and the amount he consumes; both measured in terms of one commodity only,
according to the <em>actual opportunity cost</em> of that commodity, not measured with the ‘after tax price’.</p>

‘The last time we had to increase prices (which was in 2010 when cotton prices soared) we estimated that price elasticity was around 1.1.

<p><font color='gray'>Note that sometimes elasticities are expressed in absolute value terms (a positive number). It should be clear from the context.</font></p>
<hr />
<p>Consider an individual’s expenditure on a product.</p>
<p>The total expenditure (the firm’s revenue from this): price <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> quantity</p>
<p>By taking the <em>total differential</em> of this (you don’t need to), and recalling the ‘multiplication rule’ of derivatives…</p>
<p>We have that for <em>small changes</em> in price, the percent <em>change</em> in total expenditure is:</p>
<pre><code>- pct change price $+$ pct *change* quantity</code></pre>
<p>As <span class="math inline">\(e_{Q,P}\)</span> tells you the percent change in quantity for each (small) percentage change in price, we can use this to determine the change in expenditure for a small change in price.</p>
<p><em>Considering very small increases in a good’s price:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the (individual’s) demand is <em>price-elastic</em>, quantity will decrease by a <em>larger</em> percentage than price increased. Thus her expenditure (on this good) will <em>decline</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>If the (individual’s) demand is <em>price-inelastic</em>, quantity will decrease by a <em>smaller</em> percentage than price increased. Thus her expenditure (on this good) will <em>increase </em>.</p></li>
<li><p>If the (individual’s) demand is <em>unit-elastic</em> (with respect to price), quantity will decrease by a <em>the same</em> percentage as price increased. Thus her expenditure (on this good) will <em>be unchanged</em>.</p></li>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.19.0.1</span> Example and (slightly more advanced) algebra…</h4>
<p>If price rises by 20% and quantity demanded falls by 20% what happens to revenue?
Suppose p=10 and q=10 so TR=100. Then when p=12 and q=8 TR=96. Huh? Price increased by 20% and quantity decreased by 20% so shouldn’t TR be unchanged? No! This only works for small changes.</p>
<p>TR is unchanged when p*q stays the same. With a change in each <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta q\)</span>, the new revenue is</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((p+\delta p)(q+\delta q) = pq+\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is the same as before if <span class="math inline">\(pq=pq+\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q\)</span>, i.e., if</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q=0\)</span>, i.e., if</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(-e_p + \delta p /p = -1\)</span></p>
<p>In the limit, as <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span> goes to zero, this gives us that ‘unit elasticity means a small change in quantity leads to no change in revenue.’</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sir, Professor Gordon Gemmill (Letters, December 14), surprisingly for a trained economist, assumes an income elasticity of demand of zero for housing: that is, that people do not demand more and better housing as they become richer. Nowhere in the world is this the case! My own empirical work demonstrates that around two-thirds of the rise in UK house prices, corrected for general inflation, since 1980 is because supply is not keeping up with income and population growth. Other drivers do exist … The price effects of extra supply take time to build up. I agree on that. But just imagine what would happen if we did nothing more than we are now doing: population and income growth would drive prices even higher even though we already hold the record for rises in house prices since 1970 among the group of seven leading high-income countries. We need to build far more housing, in the right locations. And we need to start now.

A better way of thinking about this is that for a given production, the firm wants to incur as low a cost as possible.

The firm’s output choice will be chosen to maximise it’s profit, with no constraints other than ’non-negativity. </font></p>

<div id="price-signal" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Price signal</h3>
<p>The price acts as a signal (leading to efficient choices):</p>
<ul>
<li>to firms, telling them ‘how much to produce’</li>
</ul>
<p>It tells them: ‘’Don’t produce past the point where your marginal cost exceeds the price you can get in the market.’’</p>
<p>At the price where the market ‘clears’ <span class="math inline">\(Q_d=Q_s\)</span>.</p>
<p>And a signal</p>
<ul>
<li>to consumers, telling them ‘how much to purchase’
<ul>
<li>and ‘which consumers should obtain the units produced’?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<p>By the definition of the market-clearing price <span class="math inline">\(P^*\)</span>,<br />
consumers can buy all they desire at P*,<br />
i.e., buy units until the last unit they buy gives them a marginal utility of <span class="math inline">\(P^*\)</span>.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>This foreshadows a result we will come to later, the efficiency of equilibrium outcomes (under given conditions).<br />
The above result means that each consumer values the last unit they consume at the same amount.<br />
Thus, we <em>never</em> have that the ‘wrong’ consumer obtains the good;<br />
which implies there can be no further gains from ‘exchange among consumers’.<br />
</p>
<p>If prices were too low (e.g., because of a price ceiling), <span class="math inline">\(Q_d&gt;Q_s\)</span><br />
demand would have to be rationed, and consumers who valued the product more than other consumers might not get as much.</p>

<p><em>Also:</em></p>
<p>With free entry and exit (and no limits on production)…</p>
<p>All firms in the market must produce the quantity that <em>minimizes</em> their average cost,</p>
<p>and all must have the same average cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>I.e., <span class="math inline">\(P* = min AC(q) = MC(q)\)</span> for any firm in the market</li>
<li>I.e., the MC curve intersects the AC curve at its minimum point.
<ul>
<li>And this is the same average cost for all firms</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<p>All firms (in the market) produce <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> that <em>minimizes</em> their AC, and for all firms this is the <em>same</em> average cost.</p>
<p><em>Why is this the case?</em></p>
<p>Why is <span class="math inline">\(P* = min [AC(q)] = MC(q)\)</span>? Which implies…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>no profit in equilibrium and firms produce at P=MC.</p></li>
<li><p>and thus implies that <span class="math inline">\(P*=AC(q)=MC(q)\)</span> for all firms in the market.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>Answer ‘by contradiction’:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Suppose here that a firm were producing at a point <em>above</em> it’s minimum AC,</p>
<ul>
<li>i.e., if <span class="math inline">\(AC(q)&gt; min [AC(q)]\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>it could instead produce at the q that minimised its AC, and make a profit (contradicting the above)</p></li>
<li><p>… (and so would other firms, who’d be induced to enter)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We assume a large number of firms have access to this efficient technology.<br />

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Long Run (LR) Supply</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have the SR supply curve (upward sloping)</li>
<li>But we know that in the LR this will shift out in response to a price change</li>
<li>Taking this shift into account gives us the <em>Long Run Supply Curve</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid confusion, note:<br />
In the SR there are movements <em>along</em> this curve in response to price changes.<br />
In the longer run, it does shift in response to price changes, as firms enter.<br />
The LR supply curve, which we will now define, does <em>not</em> shift in response to price changes<br />
But other things may cause it to shift, like changes in input costs</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><strong>So what will the LR supply curve look like?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If demand shifts out, do more enter and produce at the same efficient minimum AC?
<ul>
<li>Depends on whether entry and higher aggregate production <em>change</em> the firms’ cost functions</li>
<li><em>Input costs</em> may rise; increased demand for scarce inputs, skilled workers and public resources</li>
<li>(Also, other potential ‘externalities’ between firms, consumers, e.g., network externalities)</li>
</ul></li>

<p>DR opinion…<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>As alluded to in the introduction, this is relevant when we want to consider tje impact of long run population and economic growth</em></p>
<p>Economic and population growth leads to increased demands for most products (especially natural resources and other primary products). The shape of the LR supply curve tells us whether real resource prices will increase rapidly over time.<br />
</p>
<p>The relative slope for different products tells us which prices will rise <em>relative</em> to prices for other goods. E.g., will housing become relatively more or less expensive?</p>

<p>These conditions will indeed lead to perfect competition/MC pricing.</p>
<p>But many markets have large entry costs, first-mover advantages, and perhaps continuously increasing returns to scale. This will lead to monopoly or oligopoly in the absence of regulation.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more crucially, most products are also ‘differentiated’; if one firm charges slightly more than another firm, it will still capture the demand from those people whose are ‘close’ to it. People will pay a little extra to not travel as far. They will also pay a little extra to get the product that most suits their preferences. In this case, with free entry, we have something known as ‘monopolistic competition’, which has some of the characteristics of monopoly (e.g., pricing above marginal cost) and some characteristics of perfect competition (e.g., zero long-run profits).

<li>If you understand these slides/notes you don’t have to read chapter 10</li>
</ul>
<p>We can show that <em>under certain conditions</em> competitive markets will be efficient in equilibrium.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some markets may not reach equilibrium ‘quickly’</p></li>
<li><p>These conditions may not hold <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <em>market failure</em></p></li>
<li><p>Efficiency itself does not imply preferred outcomes: there can be a great deal of inequality</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><em>General Equilibrium</em> analysis considers the entire economy as a system of markets which may interact with one another</p>
<ul>
<li>General equilibrium: a set of prices so that <span class="math inline">\(Q_s(P)=Q_d(P)\)</span> in all markets, including input markets</li>
<li>Markets are interdependent
<ul>
<li>E.g., a government push for tomato consumption may shift tomato demand out and prices up</li>
<li>this may lead in the LR, to a shift out in tomato supply curves (firms enter)</li>
<li>this may increase the demand for <em>inputs</em> such as farm labour, raising the cost of production of other vegetables</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Will we return to equilibrium, and with what prices and quantities?</li>
<li>Stay tuned true believers! (and take more Econ, because we won’t cover it here)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Overall Pareto efficiency: no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off</p>
<ul>
<li>If we <em>could</em> do so, we would not be at an efficient point</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em>
Pareto efficiency is hard to disagree with, as a policy goal;<br />
if we could move to a situation where some were better off and none made worse off, we should do it.</p>
<p>Overall efficiency requires several conditions: Productive, Exchange, and Top-level efficiency</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> You do not need to know how the Edgeworth box works; we do not have time to cover this.</p>
<hr />
<p>Given our inputs, we can produce ‘efficiently’, i.e, along the PPF,</p>

<dd>No way to produce more of one good and less of another to make all consumers better off
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>Basic argument for top-level efficiency of competitive equilibrium:
Equilibrium prices from exchange reflect each consumer’s marginal rates of substitution for their last unit
This signals to firms the rate at which <em>all</em> consumers would be willing to trade off A for B at the margin
In equilibrium firms produce at a point where the cost tradeoffs between A and B (slope of PPF) reflects these prices.</p>

<p>Q: think of some examples.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em>
In market economies, private suppliers provide the majority of goods and services to consumers. However, certain goods are publicly provided. These include for example defense, education, and health. Why does the government instead of the market provide these goods? Which characteristics differentiate goods that are privately provided from goods that are publicly provided? How do we define public goods?
The terminology might induce the conclusion that ‘public goods are good that are publicly provided as opposed to private goods which are privately provided.’ This conclusion is simply WRONG! The public or private nature of the good is an intrinsic characteristic of goods that is not related to the provider of the good
Hence, it may well be that the state provides a private good or that the market provides a public good.</p>

<p><strong>The basic idea</strong></p>
<p>If a good is <em>non-rival</em> then additional provision is costless.
Thus,</p>
<ul>
<li>if exclusion is possible, and <em>any</em> positive price is charged, some are deterred from consuming it</li>
<li>this is inefficient: people who could benefit from the good, at no cost to others, will not consume it :(</li>
</ul>
<p>If a good is <em>non-excludable</em> it will be difficult to charge people for it</p>
<ul>
<li>many might prefer to wait for <em>others</em> to buy it, and then they enjoy it anyways (free-ride), which could lead to coordination problems</li>
</ul>
<p>and…</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Even if each person provided it for their <em>own</em> benefit (on the assumption that no one else would), they would typically choose <em>too little</em> from a social POV…</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Considering their own marginal benefits (and MRS) versus the price or cost, not the <em>social</em> marginal benefit (essentially, a positive externality)</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>But if firms cannot charge for its full value, they might not pay the fixed costs to develop/build/provide it</p>
<ul>
<li>Who would pay to produce a film that is freely pirated/distributed?</li>
<li>Who would pay to develop a drug that must be priced at its marginal cost?</li>
<li>Why contribute to police protection for your village, if your neighbours will pay for it anyways?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> Loosely, ‘rivalryness’ basically relates to whether market provision will be <em>efficient</em>; ‘excludability’ tells you whether firms can make <em>some revenue</em> from providing it, selling the same prooduced good to more than one person (or to a ‘club’ of people)</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Application: drug development</h3>
<p><em>Drug R&amp;D may be a public good, or a common resource</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive to develop and introduce a new drug – ‘sunk costs’ once developed</li>
<li>But cheap to copy and produce; without patent protection may have <span class="math inline">\(P=mc\)</span> and no ex-post profit to compensate for sunk costs
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> No incentive to develop drugs without patent protection guaranteeing ‘excludability’ and a limited monopoly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But ex-post, patent protection is costly; drug produced for a few pennies sold for £1000’s
<ul>
<li>People may not buy, or NHS may not cover</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> Inefficient: some consumers may value drug at £100’s, far above MC, yet they don’t consume it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Possible solution: Government <em>awards</em> and subsidies for drug development.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> In fact, governments do fund and subsidise R&amp;D. But there are difficulties here too. Governments may free-ride off of other governments. It is also for government to know whom to fund, hard to quantify the benefits to potential drugs, and offering ‘prizes’ to developers offers its own challenges: how to asses if the drug is good enough to deserve the prize? And too many firms working on the same drug may be wasteful.</p>

</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> To avoid confusion, note that we are talking about marginal cost as the cost of providing a unit of the public good ‘to everyone’<br />
E.g., one new movie produced, or one firework displayed to the whole city.
Once produced, all benefit, i.e., the cost of letting additional people enjoy it is <em>zero</em>.</p>

<li>Contributions decline with repetition, but not to zero</li>

<li>Individual-based (First degree; at best ‘perfect’)</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: Targeting a price at each consumer; may be done on the internet or on a discretionary basis by an individual seller.<br />
‘Perfect’ means the seller exactly predicts and charges each consumer her valuation.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Self-selection (Second degree)</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em>
Here the firm doesn’t know each consumer’s valuations, or is not allowed to ‘discriminate’ by charging different prices to different people
Instead, it sells different bundles, quantities,
or qualities of products to get high and low-value consumers to separate themselves…
E.g., first-class seats.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><font color='gray'>Note: To fully analyse these problems we need to know the techniques of ‘mechanism design under asymmetric information’, which we are not covering in this module</font></p>
<p><br> </p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Group-based (Third degree; ‘market separation’)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em>
Here the firm finds something identifiable and inherent about the consumer<br />
that is indicative of her likely valuations (and price-sensitivity).<br />
It might be her age, nationality, student-status, or even perhaps her income.</p>

<div id="first-degree-andor-perfect-price-discrimination" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.5.4</span> First-degree and/or ‘perfect’ price discrimination</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The firm can offer each individual a different price for each unit they purchase.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming you know what the consumer is willing to pay, you can make the <em>highest possible profit</em>; that is called ‘perfect’ price discrimination.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<dl>
<dt>Perfect price discrimination</dt>
<dd>Charging each consumer (for each unit) the <em>maximum</em> he or she would be willing to pay, i.e., her valuation
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br> </p>
<ul>
<li>Here the monopolist would extract <em>all the available surplus</em>; no consumer surplus remains</li>
<li>Because monopolists extracts <em>all</em> the possible surplus, this is efficient
<ul>
<li>Because max(total value of good - cost) <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> max(CS+PS)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But perfect PD is a rare/impossible extreme: requires mind reading
<ul>
<li>Close example: Website targets an individualised price to each consumer, based on clues like time-of-day, web clicks, cookie data, IP location.</li>
<li>But even this is not really <em>perfect</em> price discrimination:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em>
Here, the seller does not really know exactly what the consumer is willing to pay; he is using broad clues.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.5.10</span> Why uncertain?</h3>
<ul>
<li>When groups can be identified as ‘low and high valuation’
<ul>
<li>the high-valuation groups get charged more, and thus consume less</li>
<li>low-valuation groups get charged less, and consume more</li>
<li>Exchange efficiency: <em>given what is produced</em>, PD causes it to be consumed by people who value it relatively less!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Production: On the other hand PD can lead more to be produced/consumed</li>
</ul>
<p>…of the otherwise underproduced good (rem DWL of monopoly) <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> top-level efficiency may increase (or decrease)</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g., if with a ‘uniform price’ only the wealthy went to a restaurant…
<ul>
<li>after PD (early-bird discounts, OAP discounts, benefits discounts) the low-income may also dine in the restaurant</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> more value is produced</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These two effects trade off.
<ul>
<li>Because of the negative ‘Exchange efficiency effect’, quantity <em>produced</em> must increase after PD for it to be beneficial</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.5.11</span> But ‘arbitrage’ can foil price discrimination</h3>
<ul>
<li>If, e.g., elderly who get discounts could sell the products to the middle-aged…

<p><strong>Example: two possible outcomes</strong></p>
<p><em>Q: What is an example of such an investment with only two outcomes?</em></p>
<p>Ans: perhaps making a loan to someone to start a business; they will either pay back the loan with a high interest, or go bankrupt and pay none of it back.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a simple investment.
It will either pay a low (or zero or negative amount) or a high amount.</p>
<ul>
<li>It pays X where either <span class="math inline">\(X =x_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(X=x_2\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x_1&lt;x_2\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Probability it pays <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>; thus probability it pays <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> is…?
<span class="math inline">\(Pr(X=x_1)= 1-p\)</span></p>
<p>The expected monetary value sums the values weighted by the probabilities, i.e.,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(EV(X)=(1-p) x_1 + p x_2\)</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Specifically, pays £1020 w/ prob. 1% &amp; pays £10 w/ prob. 99%</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus <span class="math inline">\(EV(X) = 0.01 \times 1020 + 0.99 \times 10 = 10.20 + 9.90 = 20.10\)</span></p>

<div id="example-experimental-measures-of-risk-attitudes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.4</span> Example: experimental measures of risk attitudes</h2>
<p>Economists try to measure people’s level of risk aversion in various ways.</p>
<p>We try to measure ‘revealed preferences’ from real-world choices. E.g., what premium are people willing to pay to buy insurance for various things, how much premium do they demand for taking on risky investments (with the same expected monetary values), and how much more do they have to be paid (on average) in jobs with variable compensation?</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>We also run <em>experiments</em> with real or hypothetical payoffs to measure this.</p>
<p>One technique is the Holt and Laury (2002) risk elicitation task:</p>
<p><img src="holtlaurie.png" width="80%" height="2.2in" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><font color='gray'>Asked to choose one in each row (A or B)</font></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider, when would you choose A and when would you choose B?</li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<p><img src="holtlauriedetail.png" width="80%" height="3in" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>At what point do people switch from choosing the safe to choosing the risky lottery?</p>
<p>This is a measure of their risk-aversion. A risk-neutral person would switch to B on the fifth choice.
The later you switch, the more risk averse you reveal yourself to be.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="holtlauryresults.png" width="80%" height="3in" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Assume each individual has a single ‘utility function over <em>outcomes</em>’ <span class="math inline">\(u(Y)\)</span> over outcomes Y, (with similar properties as our regular utility function)</li>
</ul>
<p>This ‘little u’ function is similar to ‘regular’ utility, but here ‘curvature matters’</p>
<p>When making choices involving uncertainty, she does <strong>not</strong> (necessarily) maximise expected monetary value.</p>
<p>Instead, she maximises ‘Expected Utility’ (EU): the sum of her (VNM) valuations ‘<span class="math inline">\(u(\cdot)\)</span>’ under each outcome weighted by the <em>probability</em> of each outcome</p>
<p>… I.e., she chooses to maximise the value of her <span class="math inline">\(u(Y)\)</span> function under each outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> weighted by the probability of each outcome <span class="math inline">\(p_Y\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>By varying the <span class="math inline">\(u(Y)\)</span> function we can vary the risk preference; …Risk-loving, risk neutral and risk averse individuals can all be seen as maximizing EU</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Consider the choice between two gambles and one ‘certainty’:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Earn £1,000,000 with probability 0.1 &amp; zero with prob. 0.9</li>
<li>Earn £100,000 with probability 1/2 &amp; £50,000 with prob. 1/2</li>
<li>Earn £75,000 for certain</li>
</ol>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Imagine the realised utility <span class="math inline">\(u(y)\)</span> arises from the consumption chosen with income <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> <font color='gray'>(btw, the utility arising from maximisation under a particular set of income and prices is called ‘Indirect Utility’)</font></p>
<ul>
<li>This should be increasing (because of nonsatiation), thus <span class="math inline">\(u^\prime (y)&gt;0\)</span></li>
<li>But it mays increase at a <em>decreasing</em> rate, implying <span class="math inline">\(u^{\prime \prime}(y)&lt; 0\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This second assumption, called <em>diminishing marginal utility</em>, will imply ‘risk aversion’!</p>
<p>Or, if the person is risk-neutral, it may be linear, thus <span class="math inline">\(u(y) = a + by\)</span>, thus <span class="math inline">\(u^{\prime \prime}(y)=0\)</span></p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><font color='RawSienna'>Adv:} extcolor{gray</font>{Note that when we were choosing between two goods under certainty,
the <em>level</em> of total utility didn’t really matter, only the relative utilities. Now that we are considering gambles, the overall utility level matters, because we need to consider the extent of the tradeoff between ‘rich and poor’ states.}</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Coming back to the choice between two gambles and one ‘certainty’:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y_1\)</span>: £1,000,000 with probability 0.1 and zero with prob. 0.9</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y_2\)</span>: £100,000 with probability 0.5 and £50,000 with prob. 0.5</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y_3\)</span>: £75,000 for certain</li>
</ol>
<p>Considering each <em>outcome</em> from any of these…</p>
<p>we know <span class="math inline">\(u(1,000,000) &gt; u(100,000) &gt; u(75,000)&gt; u(50,000) &gt; u(0)\)</span>…</p>
<p>but now the <em>size of the difference</em> in these utilities matters for your decision!</p>
<p><br> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider Y1 vs Y3: Is 1 million ‘more than ten times as good (utility-wise) as 75k?’</p></li>
<li><p>Y2 v Y3: Relative to 75k, does an additional 25k yield a utility gain worth the (equally probable) loss of 25k?</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Illustration:</strong> Why the ‘size of the difference in u(y) matters’ when dealing with uncertainty.</p>
<p>Suppose there is open-enrollment in Oxford, Bristol, Plymouth.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> Here I only need to know the <em>ranking</em> of utilities of each to know your choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you choose Oxford over Bristol, even though Oxford costs more, I can infer that for you <span class="math inline">\(U(Oxford)&gt;U(Bristol)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Now, in contrast suppose the policy is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. Rank Oxford over Bristol and you have a 25% chance of getting into either, and a 50% chance of Plymouth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>B. Rank Bristol highest and you have a 100% chance of getting into Bristol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now even if your preferences are Oxford <span class="math inline">\(\succ\)</span> Bristol <span class="math inline">\(\succ\)</span> Plymouth, I don’t know if you will choose A or B; I would need to know the <em>strength</em> of your preferences.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>This means that if I observe you choose ‘option A’ I have learned <em>more</em> about your utility than I learned under open enrollment. I have learned that your preference for Oxford over Bristol is “stronger” than your preference for Bristol over Plymouth.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>The EU framework predicts that she chooses the option that maximizes the sum of ‘probabilities <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> realised utilities <span class="math inline">\(u(Y)\)</span> of each outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>’. For a two-outcome case:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[EU = (1-p) u(Y_\ell) + p u(Y_h)\]</span></p>
<p>… where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the probability of the higher income <span class="math inline">\(Y_h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_\ell\)</span> is the lower income.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><font color='RawSienna'>Adv:} extcolor{gray</font>{This framework is justified by certain ‘reasonable axioms’ we might expect choices under uncertainty to follow,
although these are perhaps not as readily acceptable as the main axioms of regular utility theory (like transitivity).
… e.g., the choices made under EU converge to the choices made under certainty as probabilities tend to 1.
The EU framework yields nice consistent behavior and can be reconciled with general equilibrium theory, preserving the basic welfare theorems}</p>

<p>G1: £1,000,000 with probability 0.1 and 0 with prob. 0.9</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.6</span> Risk aversion: graphical depiction</h2>
<p><strong>How to illustrate this:</strong></p>

<li>Show: <span class="math inline">\(EU(gamble) = (1-p)u(x_{low}) + pu(x_{high}) &lt; u(EV(x)) = u((1-p)x_{low} + px_{high})\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Draw a diagonal line between <span class="math inline">\(u(x_{low})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u(x_{high})\)</span>; the Expected Utility is in between these.</p>

</ul>
<p>This is a mathematical/graphical property.</p>
<p>Intuition: The slope of a line tells me ‘rise for a given run’, the ‘expectation’ calculation is a linear function, so the slope is constant
and the ‘share of the rise’ simply projects up from the ‘share of the run’</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<div id="illustration-binomial-distribution" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.8.1</span> Illustration: Binomial distribution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Suppose I have £ 1000, and I can bet on fair coin flips. My returns will then have what we call a “binomial distribution”.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a nice illustration of binomial distributions</p>
<ul>
<li>If I bet all £ 1000 in a single flip, there is a 50% chance I will lose my entire investment.</li>
<li>If I bet £ 500 on two flips, there is only a 25% chance I will lose my entire investment (also reduces chance of doubling by 25%).
<ul>
<li>The expected value is the same (0); thus this is better if you are risk averse.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>“Less risky”: B and A overlap with 0.5 probability; the remaining 50% of time A’s outcomes are more extreme. So it is less risky in a very general sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I bet £ 100 each in ten flips, there is a 38% chance that I will lose 20% or more of my investment.</li>
<li>If instead, I bet it on 1000 coin flips, betting £ 1 on each, there is only 6.00% chance I will lose 5% of my investment or more, and only 1/10th of 1% chance that I will lose 10% of my investment or more.</li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>Result</em>: The more I can do this “diversification”, the less risk I face.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>Note</em>: For simplicity, these examples have a ‘fair coin flip’, zero expected-return investment.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>But you might be wondering: ‘why invest at all?
Answer: Because this principle also applies to ’unfair coin flips’.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>E.g., investments in the stock market are more profitable on average than money under the mattress</p>
<p>Each £1 invested in shares has a higher expected return, but also a higher risk.
However by spreading across <em>many different</em> assets we can reduce this risk, as seen above</p>

<p>It often makes multiple predictions, or predicts ‘mixed strategies’ (randomisation).
Real-world and experimental choices are often/arguably predicted poorly by classical game theory.
For example, standard game theory says chess has a pre-determined outcome and is a bit boring (ok, you may agree about the latter).</p>

<ul>
<li>The wife has two strategies: Ballet or Boxing</li>
<li>The husband has four contingent strategies, but we focus on what he will do in each of his two possible ‘decision nodes’</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes:</em>
Here we see there is a ‘first-mover advantage’.<br />
</p>
<p>We see a very similar strategic concern in other contexts, including ‘which firm enters a market first’. Suppose that if two firms are in a market there will be a price war with consumers as well as a bidding up of input prices and salaries, and both will lose money. Perhaps by being the first firm to enter I ‘scare off the other firm’ and I can keep the profits. The other firm may ‘threaten to enter’ but that would seem to be a non-credible threat! On the other hand, suppose that I know that if I enter first the other firm can ‘learn from my mistakes’ and free-ride off my innovation. Here we would have a ‘second-mover advantage’; but in such a game a BWI may lead to the outcome ‘neither firm enters’!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>These concerns also apply to politics, and the games can of course include multiple players</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cameron’s decision to allow a referendum, followed by politician’s (Boris etc) decisions to choose a side?</p></li>
<li><p>May’s negotiations with the EU (Barnier), followed by the parliament’s ‘meaningful vote’, followed by ??</p></li>

**Additional tutorial problem I (Game theory)**
<img src="teenchoices.png" width="80%" height="3in" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Teens A and B are smitten with each other but neither knows of the other’s feelings. Suppose the teachers at their school organize a dance.  The “payoff” is based on whether their advances are rebuffed or accepted.  If they both Declare,  they get positive utility but if they are Rebuffed they face humiliation (significantly negative payoff).  Rebuffing an advance slightly elevates the teen’s standing with peers.
- What is a teen’s dominant strategy, or is there no dominant strategy?
- Find the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium or equilibria
- Find the mixed strategy equilibrium
**Additional tutorial problem II (Game theory)**
<img src="isd4by3game.png" width="80%" height="3in" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
- Apply 'Iterated strict dominance' to the above game, showing your steps
- State the pure strategies that are rationalizable.
** Additional tutorial problem III (Game theory)**
<img src="entrygame.png" width="80%" height="3in" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
- Use backwards-induction to find the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium strategies, outcomes, and payoffs, of the above game.

<li>(Note, this is a separate point than ‘diminishing marginal utility’ and risk-aversion)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Motives like ‘fairness’ may transform monetary payoffs into ‘real’ payoffs in a straightforward way

<li>E.g., in the ultimatum game, suppose player 1’s real payoffs are:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U_1(Y_1,Y_2) = Y_1 - |Y_1-Y_2|\]</span></p>

<p><br> </p>

<p><img src="ultimatumfairness.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><em>Notes:</em>
Here if earnings are equal, real payoffs are the same as earnings; 0,0 or 5,5<br />
Where earnings are unequal, player-1 gets 9 and player-2 gets 1 from material payoffs.<br />
But because of a difference of 8 in earnings, both players lose 8 in psychological payoffs<br />
so the net real payoffs if player-1 offered 1 and 2 accepted would be 9-8=1 for player-1 and 1-8=-7 for player-2.<br />
Using BWI here we see the subgame perfect NE will be that player-1 offers 5 and player-2 accepts.</p>

<p><em>Notes:</em>
Here we assume because of ‘envy’, real payoffs equal material payoffs minus the difference in payoffs <em>for the player with lower payoffs only.</em><br />
For the outcomes considered, only player-2’s payoffs are adjusted from the material payoffs;<br />
she gets 1-8 = -7 from accepting an offer of 1; her payoff is 1 but she loses 7 in envy.<br />
Because of this she will not accept such an offer. Knowing this, player-1 will offer 5.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.13</span> Ultimatum game: theoretical predictions</h2>
<p>Allowing ‘non-credible threats’, this game has as many Nash equilibria as there are possible splits of the pie</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In each of them, the Responder’s strategy is to ‘accept only if offered X (or more)’ for some <span class="math inline">\(X\geq0\)</span>, and the Proposer’s strategy is to offer exactly X.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But maybe these equilibria don’t seem like reasonable predictions (why?)</p>
<hr />
<p>Q: What does SPNE predict (use backwards induction)?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the split is <span class="math inline">\((1,0)\)</span>, the Responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting</p></li>
<li><p>That still means the Proposer offering <span class="math inline">\((1,0)\)</span> and the Responder accepting is a NE</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is found by solving the game backwards:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Proposer (correctly) anticipates the Responder will accept any offer
<ul>
<li>Thus she offers zero, which is accepted ‘in equilibrium’</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A ‘near zero’ offer would lead to a similar result, and might seem more intuitive</li>

<p><strong>Other models predict distinct outcomes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reputation:</strong> If I give to benefit my reputation or self-esteem, <em>unrealised</em> donations may matter, not just donation outcomes
<ul>
<li>May be an incentive to commit <em>more</em> the less likely a donation needs to be paid</li>
<li>‘If I win the lottery megabucks, I will give it all away’</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loss aversion:</strong> If I am ‘loss averse’ over my own consumption, it may seem ‘cheaper’ to commit before I win the bonus than after
<ul>
<li>Why? Because my <em>reference point</em> may change.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Suppose I’ve £50k income and a potential £50k bonus with 50% probability
<ul>
<li>Before winning my reference consumption may be the EV, £75k</li>
<li>So a conditional donation to donate £10k if I have a total income+bonus of £100k may not seem like a loss</li>
<li>But after I win the bonus, my new reference consumption may be £100k</li>
<li>So each pound donated might feel like a loss</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>What do you think happens when you ask people to donate either Before-conditionally or After winning a prize or bonus?</strong>
Do they commit more ‘before’ than they give ‘after’, or vice versa, or are these equivalent?</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>(25 marks) In this module we discussed  major ways in which behavioural economists argue that people diverge from classical assumptions. Briefly explain each of these four ways, citing some evidence (academic or anecdotal) for each.</strong></p>
<p>There are four general ways people diverge from classical assumptions</p>
<p><strong>1. Limited cognitive ability <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> difficult and costly to make complex decisions</strong></p>
<p>It may be very costly and difficult to do the calculations that we assume are part of standard maximization. Rather than strictly finding the optimal consumption bundles, choosing the optimal number of hours to work per day, calculating the optimal investment portfolio, etc. people may use heuristics and ‘rules of thumb’.</p>
<hr />
<p> <font color='gray'>This is too long an answer, I’m just giving you some ideas</font></p>
<p>Systematically incorrect answers to simple financial literacy questions; and responses correlate with holding an extremely high interest loans.</p>
<p>Many people state they have keep separate fixed budgets for different categories of expenditure (food, vacations, charity etc).</p>
<p>In marketing/behavioral experiments adding more choices has sometimes been found to reduce purchases within a category.</p>
<p>Also, adding an (unchosen) ‘largest size’ choice seen to increase consumption of the second largest choice (heuristic: ‘choose the middle option’)</p>
<p>See also ‘taxi driver’s heuristic’</p>
<!---
Various experiments:  when people are given coupons and subsidies for one particular good,  for which they typically consume more than that amount of anyways,  this  still disproportionately increases their consumption of that item, rather than being fully fungible.  E.g., there's a paper where a 'drinks voucher' (relative to a 'food voucher')  at a restaurant leads to a greater overall consumption of beverages even for people who normally consume many beverages.
-->
<hr />

<p>People struggle to make choices that they know are in their best long-term interest. (Evidence: see next part)</p>

<p> Significant charitable giving (1% of UK GDP), large part of income spent on family and gifts. Rejection of positive offers in ultimatum game experiments (in various lab and naturalistic contexts). Contribution to linear public goods, cooperation in prisoners dilemmas, even in 1-shot games …</p>
<hr />


<p>People seem to act to maximise targets and avoid losses relative to reference points. For example several papers report evidence consistent with people (e.g., taxi drivers) setting ‘earnings targets’ and thus working  on days when their per-hour earnings are higher (and they should know this). It can be shown that if drivers were to work fewer hours on ‘bad’ and more hours on ‘good’ days they could more money working the same number of hours, and even have less variance in a number of hours they work. This cannot be reconciled with a model maximising an unchanging utility function.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>(25 marks) For  of the major departures above, give a  of such behaviour, and briefly describe the nature of the evidence for this, and present one behavioural economics model explaining this behaviour.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><strong>‘Specific example of behaviour’</strong></p>
<p>The Allais paradox offers evidence against Expected Utility maximisation (over outcomes) and in line with Loss Aversion and Prospect Theory.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scenario such as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gamble A: 89% chance win £ 1 mln, 10% chance win £ 5 mln, &amp; 1% chance win 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Gamble B: £1 million with certainty.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gamble C: 89% chance of winning 0 and an 11% chance of winning £1 million</p></li>
<li><p>Gamble D: a 90% chance of win 0 and 10% chance of winning £5 million.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Consistently in hypothetical and incentivised experiments people tend to choose B over A and also choose D over C.</p>
<hr />
<p>:</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(B \succ A\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(EU(A) &gt; EU(B)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow U(1m) &gt; 0.89 \: U(1m) + 0.1 \: U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(0.11 \: U(1m) &gt; 0.1 U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0)\)</span></p>

<p><br> </p>
<p>However, if <span class="math inline">\(D \succ C\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(EU(D)&gt;EU(C)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow 0.9 \: U(0) + 0.1 U(5m) &gt; 0.89 \: U(0) + 0.11 \: U(1m)\)</span></p>
<p>Implying <span class="math inline">\(0.1 \: U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0) &gt; 0.11 \: U(1m)\)</span></p>
<p>Contradicting the above!</p>
<hr />

<p><strong>‘Describe the nature of evidence for this’</strong></p>
<p> In hypothetical experiments by Kahneman and Tversky, as well in experiments with real incentives (e.g., Huck and Muller), people tend to choose B over A, and also to choose D over C. (Sometimes the same people will make of these apparently inconsistent choices but in general the differences in proportions are large enough that we can show the general pattern even if we’re only asking people to make a single choice.)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>‘…and present one behavioural economics model’</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><br> </p>


<p>Theory: People evaluate outcomes relative to . Falling below these reference points is particular costly to utility; the usual specification models utility as the some of a standard risk-averse utility function and a ’ gain-loss’ utility function. The latter is negative where some outcome (e.g., earnings) falls below a reference point; it’s slope is assumed to be greatest for ‘small losses’ and then more gradual for larger losses. In net this can make people risk seekers over a range of losses, willing to increase the risk of a large loss to reduce the risk of a small loss. The reference points themselves may change depending on the framing of the decision, on previous expectation, on unrealised states, and in general on things that are not relevant to future material outcomes of the decision.</p>
<hr />
<p><br> </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Considering A &amp; B, the ref. point may be close to £1000, as this can be had with certainty.</p>
<ul>
<li>A seems to ‘risk a costly loss of £1000’, thus may choose ‘safer’ <span class="math inline">\(B&gt;A\)</span>, notwithstanding its far lower EV (£1000 vs £1390)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Considering D &amp; C, ref. point may be close to 0, as EV’s of each are low, &amp; 0 is likeliest outcome</p>
<ul>
<li>So ‘don’t worry about losses’, choose D over C because higher EV (£500 vs. £110)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><font color='gray'>This could also be shown with a diagram of EU in income, and a shifting reference point; see notes and text</font></p>
<hr />
<p><em>By the way, here are some more behavioural econ problems to practice … from Nicholson and Snyder chapter 17 (12th ed, 11th similar)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>17.2: this will be especially helpful for understanding the EU basis of the Allais Paradox</li>
<li>17.3</li>
<li>(17.5)</li>
<li>17.7: pretty good setup for time inconsistent behaviour</li>
<li>(17.8) - also a good setup for time inconsistency, has video solution on CourseMate</li>
<li>17.9 - decent for understanding loss aversion. Should say ‘would his choice change <em>if</em> his reference point’ (‘if’ is missing)</li>

<li id="fn15"><p>How do I know the line connecting these points describes such mixtures? You can see by defining these formally and plotting this line… in multiple dimensions this is a plane or ‘hyperplane’.<br />
More inuitively, consider that the slope of this line represents the slope of the difference in these bundles: ‘the reduction in hamburgers divided by the increase in soft drinks’. (Equivalently, in giving up a share of the upper left bundle to gain the lower right bundle, the number of soft drinks one gains for each hamburger sacrificed.) In giving up a certain share of one bundle to gain a share of the other bundle I am reducing my consumption of one good to gain another good at a <em>constant linear</em> rate. Here, I need to move from 6 to 2 hamburgers and from 2 to 6 soft drinks. The slope of this is just one (6-2/6-2) in this case, as seen in the dashed line.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p> <font color='red'>Warning:</font> These are not the same as the ‘complements’ and ‘substitutes’ in demand functions which we will see you later, referring to the impact of changing prices.<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>Strictly speaking, the slope is how much Y you <em>get</em> when you get another X, but since this is negative we see that you ‘get a negative amount’, i.e., give up some amount of Y.<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>The <span class="math inline">\(\rightleftarrow\)</span> symbol means ‘if and only if’, i.e., the object on the right-hand side implies the object on the left-hand side, and vice versa. In some context this means a ‘necessary and sufficient condition’, but here it is just basically a definition.<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>They can also be equal at some other suboptimal points, where she is not spending all of her income, or if the indifference curves have a shape very different from the one above (more or less, where they are not ‘convex’). Where she is consuming some of every good, this is a <em>necessary</em> condition for such a point to represent an optimal consumption choice, but it may not be a sufficient condition. May also be optimal for her to consume <em>none</em> of certain goods, in which case this condition will not hold. We return to this later.<a href="#fnref19" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn22"><p>The General Cobb-Douglas function is : <span class="math inline">\(U(X,Y)=X^a Y^b\)</span> where a and b arepositive constants.<a href="#fnref22" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>We are ‘allowed’ to square the whole thing to simplify the problem. Why? Utility is only “identified up to a monotonic transformation”. In general you can transform the utility function in any way that preserves the ordering of preferences over the combinations of X and Y. (E.g., multiply/divide it by any positive amount, add any constant, take it to any power, put it into an exponential or large transformation… Doing this, replacing utility function with this “new” utility function will have no impact on the choices the person makes. The only thing that will change is the realized level utility, which is not a meaningful concept. However, this will no longer hold later in the module when we talk about uncertainty and expected utility.<a href="#fnref23" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>
<span class="math inline">\(MU_X\)</span> is the slope of <span class="math inline">\(U(X,Y)\)</span> in X at a particular point,
i.e., the (partial) derivative with respect to X
<span class="math inline">\(MU_X = \frac{\partial}{\partial X} (XY)^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} (XY)^{-1/2}Y = \frac{1}{2} (Y/X)^{1/2}\)</span>

<li id="fn26"><p>I say ‘here’ both because the MRS comes specifically from this Cobb-Douglas utility function. Also, because we now have nice convex indifference curves with ‘normal’ slopes, unlike for perfect complements or substitutes. The more of one good you have the less you value it relative to the other good (unlike perfect substitutes)
but you still value more of it somewhat (unlike for perfect complements)<a href="#fnref26" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>You always spend the same <em>amount</em> on each good, no matter the price (Note, that doesn’t mean the same number of units). This ‘constant expenditure shares’ are a characteristic of Cobb-Douglas functions that limit their usefulness and realism. But we still use them all the time in teaching.<a href="#fnref27" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>To repeat, this is not a general result, it is a result coming from this particular version of the Cobb-Douglas utility function. Obviously, Economics does not predict that everyone spent equal shares of their income on each good!<a href="#fnref28" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>You can solve for the optimal <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> by ‘symmetry’: as utility
and budget constraint are symmetric everything we said holds replacing X with Y.<br />

<li id="fn30"><p>Answer: practice, practice, practice. :)<a href="#fnref30" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>remember, this is not the same as ‘perfect substitutes/complements’<a href="#fnref31" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>Of course not! At least they ‘should’ not change; your optimal choices would not change. Perhaps in some specific context the way the problem is framed may affect people’s choices, but that is not what is being asked here. Furthermore, we are considering ‘normative’ economics in the sense of ‘what would rational optimizing agents do’?<a href="#fnref32" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p> There are ‘adding up’ conditions.
You always spend all of your income. Thus, if as your income increases, you spend less on some subset of goods,
you <em>must</em> spend more on the remaining goods.<a href="#fnref33" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>This standard definition of the ‘income effect’ of a price change combines both of the effects we saw when looking at the impact of an income change on consumption of X.
More consumption of each good is possible, but the MRS may differ at this higher consumption and utility level.<a href="#fnref34" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>This topic is more nuanced and complicated than we will cover in the main content of this module.<br />
To fully cover this, we would have to consider the theoretical concept of a ‘compensated’ aka ‘Hicksian’ demand curve,<br />
where income is adjusted to hold utility constant while price ratios change.<br />
This also allows us to consider ‘net versus gross’ substitution, and ‘equivalent vs compensating variation’.<br />
More advanced economics modules will cover this extensively and rigorously.<a href="#fnref35" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>Note: ‘Taxes based on ground-floor area’ are mentioned throughout the web, but I couldn’t find an authoritative reference to this. If anyone finds one, please let me know!<a href="#fnref36" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn37"><p>Why ‘compensated’ behavior? Essentially, because taxes in general will always leave people with less effective income, causing them to change their consumption choices to reflect the new, lower indifference curves. What matters for the deadweight loss is how the taxes change their behavior at this new lower-income state. This is a fundamental issue in Public Finance/taxation.<a href="#fnref37" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn38"><p>This illustration is a single example; to see that this holds generally, take Public Economics. There are some interesting and surprising results. A caveat: If you <em>can’t</em> tax one good (e.g., leisure)<br />
you <em>don’t</em> want to tax all other goods equally.<br />
In general, you want to tax goods that distort behaviour less overall.<a href="#fnref38" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>In the UK, the ‘welfare wall’ is usually referred to as the ‘benefits trap’ or ‘unemployment trap’. This is something successive governments have tried to remedy, recently, with the ‘Universal Credit’.<a href="#fnref39" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p><font color='RawSienna'>Adv:</font> These ‘cross-price effects’ include both <em>substitution</em> and <em>income</em> effects. (See micro quiz 3.3).<a href="#fnref40" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn41"><p>Note: Economists disagree as to how to consider or model changes in preferences<a href="#fnref41" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn42"><p>In other words, if you said to a consumer ‘this product will stop being produced/offered unless you pay us enough money’, this is the maximum amount the consumer would be will be willing to pay to keep the product on the market, at its current price.<a href="#fnref42" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn43"><p>With a linear demand curve this is a triangle, which has an area that is easy to compute. More generally, this is a `definite integral’.<a href="#fnref43" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn44"><p>This can be applied to the individual or market demand curve to obtain individual or total consumer surplus (although there are some technical issues with the latter).<a href="#fnref44" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn45"><p>This concept can also be applied to measuring the value added by the introduction of a new good (see Application 3.4). This is useful to know for policy, particular in formulating subsidies for R&amp;D and in adjusting the CPI. It also could be used to compute damages in court cases where a firm is accused of stifling innovation.<a href="#fnref45" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn46"><p>Strictly speaking we are talking about the limit of these responses, i.e., derivatives.<br />
The elasticity is basically the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(ln(y)\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(ln(x)\)</span>; useful to know if you want to run a regression computing an elasticity, or if you want to interpret such a regression.<a href="#fnref46" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn47"><p>Ans: Over time, consumers can adjust to price changes by changing their consumption patterns. E.g., if petrol gets more expensive I can switch to a hybrid or electric car, or a bicycle.<a href="#fnref47" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn48"><p>Ans: If it were at such a point, it could raise its price and its revenue would increase and costs would decline<br />
(because it would be selling fewer products but for greater total revenue.)<br />
A caveat is that it might do this for a long term strategic advantage; e.g., to gain customer loyalty and market share, intending to take its profits later. we come back to a related point later in the context of monopoly pricing.<a href="#fnref48" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn49"><p>Ans: Yes (do you know why?)<a href="#fnref49" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn50"><p>A major difference: a firm <em>also</em> chooses the <em>level</em> of output, while the consumer has a fixed budget constraint … we return to the firm in later sections.<a href="#fnref50" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn51"><p> I think the first point is valid, but it doesn’t suggest that 2 firms would be more efficient than 1; these DRS would set in as a function of <em>total</em> output, not a single firm’s output. The second and third arguments are complicated and perhaps harder to justify. The case for DRS is unproven, IMHO<a href="#fnref51" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn52"><p>This spawned a large literature on the ‘theory of the firm’ emphasizing things like incomplete contracts, hold-up, relationship specific assets, lobbying costs, and more.<a href="#fnref52" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn53"><p>See example in table 1 in text.<a href="#fnref53" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn54"><p> Ans: Demand curves slope down, so less revenue for each additional unit.<br />
Also, the <em>impact</em> of the reduced price is greater because the more we sell the more units this affects.<a href="#fnref54" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn55"><p>The NS text gives a good illustration and examples of why it is fine to assume that a small producer’s output has no impact on price<a href="#fnref55" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn56"><p> There are specific conditions for the existence of a ‘unique maximum-profit quantity’. E.g., this will be ensured by everywher- decreasing marginal revenue and increasing or nondecreasing marginal costs<a href="#fnref56" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn57"><p>Ans:
if q&gt;q*, MR, which is decreasing in q, will be below MC.
Firm can do better if it reduces q somewhat– cost decrease will be larger than revenue decrease.
If <span class="math inline">\(q&lt;q^{\ast}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(MR&lt;MC\)</span> – better to increase q and revenue increases more than costs<a href="#fnref57" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn58"><p>This seemed to be an urgent question in 2016 when I first wrote this section. It still seems to be an urgent question.<a href="#fnref58" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn59"><p>Start from the beginning, this is specifically referred to beginning on about slide 20 ‘The Firm’s Long-Run Decision to Exit or Enter a Market’; use ‘presentation mode’. However, note that slide 19 states ‘the firm considers its sunk costs when deciding to exit, but ignores them when deciding whether to shut down.’ This is not stated precisely. They are referring to those ‘fixed costs’ which must be incurred at regular intervals (e.g., a license fee every year)… from the pov of midyear, this years’ license fee is sunk, but next year’s is not.<a href="#fnref59" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn60"><p>Note that much of this may be revision for many of you.<a href="#fnref60" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn61"><p>For a further revision, this process is well mapped out in a step-by step Powerpoint you can download: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vyvao528job7q0q/fc.ppt?dl=0" class="uri">https://www.dropbox.com/s/vyvao528job7q0q/fc.ppt?dl=0</a> (This is specifically referred to beginning on slide 39; use ‘presentation mode’)<a href="#fnref61" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn62"><p>For a variety of reasons, we shouldn’t always expect the LR curve to be upward sloping. It might also be flat or downward sloping. Thus, if the demand curve for, e.g., microchips or personalised software shifts out, we may see that equilibrium price <em>declines</em> in the long run.<a href="#fnref62" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn63"><p>Adv: When a firm owns a unique resource it can arguably make a LR profit called a ‘Ricardian rent’. However this could be seen as the return to an asset which should be ‘charged against’ these profits.<a href="#fnref63" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
