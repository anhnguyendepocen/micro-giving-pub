\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Hunters who have more beavers than deer would refuse to trade at these prices.
\item This alone does not tell us how many deers and beavers will be traded.
\item The amount of time it takes to hunt a deer versus a beaver may depend on how many have already been caught.
\item There are inputs into the production process other than labour which may affect the price.
\item No one would ever hunt beavers at these prices.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
b, c, and d are valid critiques.


b, c, and d are valid critiques. 

a. 'Hunters who have more beavers than deer would refuse to trade at these prices.' This is not true. If hunters need more of either good for their own consumption than they have hunted (e.g., suppose each are 'necessities'), they will trade these in the market. (Note that  given the implied 'production function' at these prices, the hunter couldn't do any better by reallocating her hours instead of trading.) Also, we can imagine this example in terms of prices in some baseline currency which could be used for other goods... the hunter may want to sell her kill to buy these other goods, and if these are the prices she faces, she will do so.


b. True, this *is* a limitation. The above claim only tells us about the relative price of these 2 goods, perhaps reflecting a supply curve, perhaps a demand curve, but it doesn't tell us the quantity exchanged. However many are traded, this statement only tells us at what 'rate' they are traded.

\

c.  Yes, there may be diminishing returns to labour (hunting) in each good as the stock of each animal is used up. This is an important part of the supply/demand model, implying an upwards sloping supply curve. If each deer is more and more (time) costly to hunt, only a higher price will induce hunters to supply more in aggregate.


d. True, there may be capital inputs (e.g., guns and ammo) and land inputs (the hunting grounds), as well as  transportation costs, fuel etc. E.g., it might be that it takes twice as long to hunt a deer as a beaver but it costs less in 'capital', as the cost of the ammunition and gun maintenance per additional deer is less than the cost of maintaining beaver traps per additional beaver (when using the optimal mix of inputs).

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item  Under EU theory, an individual compares gambles based on the sum of the VnM utility of each outcome weighted by its actual probability. Under PT, individuals may overweight or underweight a 'prospect' relative to it's true probability. 
\item  Under PT, an individual may evaluate a 'prospect' based on the variance of the monetary outcomes, while under EU-theory, an individual will always choose the investment with the greatest expected monetary value.
  \item Under EU-theory, an individual must be always equally risk-averse, risk-loving, or risk-neutral when considering a gamble relative to ANY level of wealth, while under PT an individual can be very risk-averse starting from a low level of wealth, but then less risk-averse, or even risk-loving, when starting from a higher wealth level.
  \item  With PT, an individual who finds herself with wealth \pounds 5000 may be willing to take a fair gamble if the \pounds 5000 wealth is percieved as a `loss relative to a reference point' but this same person might not be willing to take the same fair gamble if the \pounds 5000 were at or above the 'reference point.' Under EU-theory, this could never be the case; a 'reference point' will not affect decisions 
  \item Under EU-theory, an individual will always be \emph{Prudent}, while under PT, she will never be \emph{Prudent}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
 Under EU theory, an individual compares gambles based on the sum of the VnM utility of each outcome weighted by its actual probability. Under Prospect Theory, individuals may overweight or underweight a 'prospect' relative to it's true probability.  (remember that this is one of the two main elements of Prospect Theory) AND
\bigskip 
 With prospect theory, an individual who finds herself with wealth \pounds 5000 may be willing to take a fair gamble if the \pounds 5000 wealth is percieved as a `loss relative to a reference point' but this same person might not be willing to take the same fair gamble if the \pounds 5000 were at or above the 'reference point.' Under EU-theory, this could never be the case; a 'reference point' will not affect decisions. (This is the other key element of PT)
\bigskip 
The other claims are false. Under EU-theory an individual can have any risk attitude, and it need not be constant for all levels of wealth. Under EU-theory she may or may not be Prudent (and this can also vary over the range of wealth levels.)

 \end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

Correct answer:

[only ONE] Considering best responses, the more A grazes, the less B will graze, and vice-versa (within the range where both graze positive amounts).

AND

%Under Nash equilibrium play, the total benefits (summed across both shepherds) are at less than half of their maximum possible level (considering any level of grazing that could be agreed upon, if an agreement could be enforced).

\bigskip

\textit{Explanation}

Solving for best responses, we take the FOC (set derivatives equal to 0)

to get, for shepherd A:
$120-2s_A-s_B-2s_A=0$ $\rightarrow$ $120-4s_A=s_B \rightarrow 4s_A=120-s_B \rightarrow s_A=30-s_B/4$

For shepherd B this yields $(120-2s_A-s_B)-s_B=0$ $\rightarrow$ $120-2s_A=2s_B$ $\rightarrow s_B=60-s_A$.

So `Considering best responses, the more shepherd A grazes, the less shepherd B will graze, and vice-versa.'


Plugging these in, $s_A^{ne}=30 - (60-s_A)/4 = 30-15+s_A/4 \rightarrow (3/4)s_A = 15 \rightarrow s_A^{ne} = 60/3=20$

Plugging in to B's BR: $s_B^{ne}=60-20=40$

(So `Under Nash equilibrium play, A will graze as much as or more than shepherd B' is FALSE.)

Total sheep grazed NE are thus $s_A+s_B=20+40=60$

(so `Under Nash equilibrium play, the total number of sheep grazed (summed across both shepherds) is less than 50' is FALSE)

The total benefit in general is $s_A(120-2s_A-s_B) +  s_B(120-2s_A-s_B)$.

Under NE this is $20(120-2\times20-40)+40(120-2\times20-40)=20(40)+40(40)=2400$.

Considering the optimum provision, we have to optimize over two variables, with potentially binding non-negativity constraints. To keep it simple, let's use intuition.

The total benefit in general is $s_A(120-2s_A-s_B) +  s_B(120-2s_A-s_B)$.

Consider the marginal benefit of either adding a sheep: 
$MB_A= 120-4s_A-3s_B$
$MB_B= 120-3s_A-2s_B$


For any level of grazing by either ($s_A$ and $s_B$), 'A grazing an additional sheep' always yields less additional net value than does 'B grazing an additional sheep'.  Thus, it is clear that B `doing all the grazing' will lead to the greatest level of total benefit. So, set $S_B=0$. This yields a much simpler maximisation: 

$s_B= argmax [s_B(120-s_B)]$. Clearly this is just 'maximising a rectangle's area.' The FOC yields an optimum where $120-2s_B=0$ $\rightarrow$ $s_B^{opt}=60$ (and $s_A^{opt}=0$). Note that in this case this is the same total level of grazing as in the NE, but the sheep are allocated to the more efficient shepherd.  

%Setting $s_A$ to maximize this implies $120-4s_A-3s_B=0$, so  $4s_A+3s_B=120$ $\rightarrow s_A=30-(3/4)s_B$. (We can already see that this is less than the amount specified in A's BRF.)

%Setting $s_B$ to maximize this implies $120-3s_A-2s_B=0$, so  $3s_A+2s_B=120$ $\rightarrow 2s_B=120-3s_A \rightarrow s_B=60-(3/2)s_A$

%Plugging this in: $s_B=60-(3/2)(30-(3/4)s_B)= 60-45+(9/8)s_B$ $\rightarrow (1/8)s_B=$ $\rightarrow s_B^{opt}=40$.

%Plugging in yields $s_A^{opt}=30-(3/4)40=0$.

This yields payoffs $0+60 \times (120-60)=3600$.

These benefits are greater than before, but less than twice as high (2400 vs 3600). This is arguably an example of the tragedy of the commons; the individual and group incentives are not aligned; however, redistribution of the output would be necessary for both parties to benefit from this optimal structure.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item For a firm to be a monopoly it must be that average costs in this industry decline in output over the entire range of potential outputs.
\item A monopoly does not face a 'demand curve' in a meaningful sense, as its demand curve can rotate over time in response to changes in price. 
\item The monopoly maximises its profit by charging the price where marginal revenue equals marginal costs (as long as this price is above average costs)
\item A monopoly does not have a 'supply curve': depending on the slope of and intercept of the demand curve, the monopoly may provide the same quantity at a different price or a different quantity at the same price.
\item the producer surplus of a monopoly is less than that of a firm under perfect competition
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
True statements:

The monopoly maximises its profit by charging the price where marginal revenue equals marginal costs (as long as this price is above average costs) -- in fact this is true of firms under basically any market structure, including monopoly.

AND

A monopoly does not have a 'supply curve': depending on the slope of and intercept of the demand curve, the monopoly may provide the same quantity at a different price or a different quantity at the same price Note that a monopoly does not have a 'supply curve', as its profit-maximising price changes in response to a rotation in the demand curve.

The other statements are false. Diminishing average costs may lead to the situation of a natural monopoly, but this is not a necessary condition for there to be a monopoly; there may also be legal barriers to entry.

A monopoly faces a demand curve just like a firm under any other market structure.

A monopoly will gain a producer surplus, while a firm under perfect competition will not.

 \item Price discrimination based on cookies and 'time of arrival' on a webpage will be perfect price discrimination
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

Only one statement is true, the remainder are false. (With these instructions, be sure to fill in the bubbles for the false statements only)

FALSE: 'The ability to price discriminate may reduce the profits of a monopolist.'

Note that the ability to price discriminate will never reduce the monopoly's profits, and will potentially allow these to increase. Remember, the firm could always ignore this tool if it is not helpful.

\bigskip 

FALSE: 'Under second-degree price discrimination the consumer who values the good MORE than the other consumer will purchase less than the efficient quantity or quality of the good'

No, it is the reverse. The quality/quantity are distorted downwards for the consumer who values the good LESS; this is to prevent the more valuable consumer from choosing this cheaper bundle.

\bigskip 

FALSE: 'Both second and third-degree price discrimination involve self-selection by on the basis consumers, as the firm cannot identify any attributes of the consumer in either case without the consumer voluntarily disclosing these'

This describes second-degree price discrimination but not third-degree price discrimination, where the category of consumer CAN be identified

\bigskip 

FALSE: 'Price discrimination based on cookies and 'time of arrival' on a webpage will be perfect price discrimination.'

This may combine second and third-degree price discrimination and it may yield a different price being paid by each consumer. However, this will not allow the seller to perfectly mind read and determine every consumers exact willingness to pay.

\bigskip 

TRUE:   'For third-degree price discrimination to improve total welfare it must lead to an increase in the quantity exchanged (this is a necessary condition)

As 3dpd reduces exchange efficiency (some people may obtain the good who value it less than others who do not obtain the good), we need an increase in quantity (improving top-level efficiency) to potentially make up for this.

TRUE: If $p=1/2$ and $q=1/4$, and $A_0=B_0=0$, a risk-neutral person will choose lottery $A$ if $A_1>2B_1$.

\question[4] \textcolor{black}{\textit{There are between 1 and 5 correct answers; partial credit will be awarded.}} According to modern microeconomic theory, which of the following situations may  lead to a departure from efficiency
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Uncertainty: 'coin flip' risk outcomes combined with different levels of risk aversion.
\item A single firm that can exclude other firms from entering, but which cannot price discriminate. 
\item Information is asymmetric: sellers know more about the quality of a product sold than potential buyers do (and the true quality of a product cannot be directly contracted upon).
\item In many business relationships one firm controls the level of efforts/costs put into a joint project, and the other firm does not have direct control over this. However, a complete contract can be written over these costs.
\item In many employment relationships the employeee controls the level of effort she puts in, but the employer cannot observe this, only observing the outcome. Employees are generally more  risk-averse than their employers.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
YES: A single firm that can exclude other firms from entering, but which cannot price discriminate. $\rightarrow$ this can lead to the deadweight loss of monopoly.

YES: Information is asymmetric: sellers know more about the quality of a product sold than potential buyers do, and the true quality of a product cannot be directly contracted upon. -- this is an example of the 'Lemons problem' 

YES: In many employment relationships the employeee controls the level of effort she puts in, but the employer cannot observe this, only observing the outcome. Employees are generally more  risk-averse than their employers. -- this is the classic 'Moral Hazard' problem



NOT: Uncertainty: 'coin flip' risk outcomes combined with different levels of risk aversion. If information is symmetric and markets for taking on/hedging risk exist, we can attain a first best outcome.

NOT: In many business relationships one firm controls the level of efforts/costs put into a joint project, and the other firm does not have direct control over this. However, a complete contract can be written over these costs. -- Here effort costs are both observable and contractible, so neither faces risk and limited liability should not be a issue

\question[4] \textcolor{black}{\textit{There are between 1 and 5 correct answers; partial credit will be awarded.}}
The `lemons model' of asymmetric information (Akerlof, 1970), for the case that leads to inefficient outcomes (missing markets),  assumes:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]  \item The value of the used car is uncertain; it follows (e.g.) a uniform distribution, and neither the potential buyer nor seler knows any more than this.
  \item Sellers have a strong `endowment effect', and thus would accept less for the car than they would be willing to pay for it.
  \item The seller values a car of a particular quality more than the potential buyer.
  \item The potential buyer values a car of a particular quality more than the seller.
  \item Sellers and buyers can write complete and enforceable contracts over the ex-post observed  true value of the car.
  \item The seller has a 'hidden action' she can take, which the buyer does not observe directly.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
The potential buyer values a car of a particular quality more than the seller. This condition is necessary to ensure that 'trade increases surplus, so the absence of trade reduces it.'
\end{solution}
