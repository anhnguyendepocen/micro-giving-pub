John M. Countryside makes \pounds 50 per week at his summer job and spends his entire weekly income on lager and crisps,
because these are the only two items that provide utility to him. Furthermore, John only values a pint of lager if he can have two packets of crisps to go with it, and he only values crisps if he can have a half pint of lager to go with each packet of crisps.

For the purpose of this question, assume that lager and crisps can be consumed in any fractional amount, so John could gain utility, e.g., from 0.2 packs of crisps and 0.1 pints of lager.

\begin{parts}

\part (3 marks) State John's utility function formally (i.e., as a mathematical function).

\begin{solution}

His preferences can be characterised by the utility function $U(\ell,c)=min(2\ell,c)$, where $\ell$ is the number of pints of lager and $c$ the number of packets of crisps he consumes.

Any `min' function where the first argument has a coefficient twice the seocnd argument (e.g., $min(\ell, c/2)$) is also correct)
\end{solution}

\part (5 marks) If lager costs \pounds 3 per pint and crisps cost \pounds 1 per packet, how many will John buy of each in a week?

\begin{solution}

Income $I = 50$

\medskip

$2\ell = c$ at optimum

\medskip

$P_\ell \ell + P_c c = 3\ell + c = 50$

\medskip

At optimum (substituting in $c=2\ell$) we have $3\ell + 2\ell = 50$

$\rightarrow \ell= 50/5=10 \rightarrow c = 2\ell=20$

\medskip

So John buys 10 pints of lager and 20 packets of crisps per week.

\end{solution}

\part (3 marks)  Now suppose that the price of crisps rises to \pounds 2 per packet. How many pints of lager and packets of crisps will he buy?

\begin{solution}

Again, consider the `bundles' John will always buy, of 1 pint of lager and 2 packets of crisps.

Now a bundle costs $\pounds 3 + 2 \times \pounds 2 = \pounds 7$ so he can afford only 50/7, or a little over 7 bundles.

So he will buy 7 pints and 14 packets of crisps (7.14 pints and 14.29 packets of crisps is also an acceptable answer).

\end{solution}

\part (7 marks) Show your results by graphing the budget constraints from part a and part b. (Let lager be on the vertical axis). Also draw John's indifference curves.

\begin{solution}

%\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/jeansshoes_perfectcomplements.png}

For the initial prices the budget constraint should begin at the vertical axis, where $\ell=50/3$ and $c=0$. It slopes downwards with slope -1/3 (for each pint less consumed, you can consume 3 more packets of crisps), and intersects the horizontal axis at $\ell=0$ and $c=50$

\medskip

At the new prices the budget constraint begins at the same point, but the slope is now $-2/3$ (for each two pints of lager given up, John can buy three packets of crisps), and it intersects the horizontal axis at $c=50/2=25$.

\medskip

John's indifference curves are L-shaped since he gains utility only when pints of lager and packets of crisps are purchased in a one to two proportion. The vertex of each `L' should be at the point where $c=2\ell$.

These indifference curves should intersect the original budget constraint at $\ell=10, c=20$, and intersect the new budget constraint at roughly $\ell=7.14, c=14.29$.

\end{solution}

\part (3 marks) To what effect (income or substitution) do you attribute the change in utility levels between part a and part b? Explain.

\begin{solution}
The change from U2 to U1 is entirely attributable to the income effect.
There is no substitution effect due to John's insistence on a fixed proportion of crisps and lager; for every utility level, there is only a single cost-minimising bundles.

In other words, there is no way to `substitute lager for crisps' and maintain the same utility.

\end{solution}

\part (4 marks) In this example, what is the income elasticity of demand for lager? Is lager an `inferior good', a `luxury good,' or neither. Explain.

\begin{solution}


As income increases, demand for lager will increase proportionally, as both goods are consumed in fixed proportions. Thus the income elasticity is 1 (unit elastic).

Lager is neither an inferior good nor a luxury good.

\medskip
An inferior good is one where the quantity demanded declines as income increases, or increases and income declines. As the above effect is entirely an `income effect', we see it is equivalent to the impact of income declining. As income declined, lager consumption declined, so it is not an inferior good.

\medskip
A luxury good is one for which demand increases more than proportionally as income increases, or decreases more than proportionally as income decreases. As the only two goods consumed are consumed in \textit{fixed} proportions, the consumption of each scales proportionally in income. Thus lager is not a luxury good.

Partial credit: We also know the above is a Cobb-Douglas utility function so expenditure shares will be constant and reflect the relative power coefficients; as the coefficient on $\ell$ is twice that on c, we will spend twice as much on $\ell$, which, as it is twice as expensive, means buying the same amount of each.

  			This diagram is straightforward; downward sloping (at a diminishing rate) dmrs indifference curves that asymptote but never hit the X or Y axes.

  			Both are neccessities. You can show that the MRS (the amount of one you'd be willing to give up for a unit of the other) goes to infinite as the consumption of either goes to zero.

\begin{solution}

Rationality assumption: the players are rational (choose to maximise own payoffs given a set of beliefs)
\begin{itemize}
  \item  We know rational players will not play dominated strategies
  \item The players themselves know this.
\end{itemize}

Common Knowledge of Rationality assumption:

The players know all other players are rational. The players know all players know all players are rational.  The players know (all players know ' ad infinitum) all players are rational.

\begin{itemize}
  \item  Thus the players know what the other players will never do, and eliminate these from consideration
  \item The players will not play a strategy if another strategy is always better against this reduced set of possibilities
  \item Etc.
  \item  This process is called 'Iterated Strict Dominance' (ISD)
  \item  We will call strategies that survive ISD 'rationalizable' strategies (this is not the technical definition but it is very close)
\end{itemize}

More technically: If a player is not playing a \textit{rational} strategy, there is \textit{no belief} about the other player's (or all the other players', more generally) strategy that could justify this play. If he is not playing the best response to \textit{some} rational strategy of the other, there is no belief about the other's play consistent with the other player's rationality that would justify this strategy. Iterating this process of thinking yields the direct definition of rationalisability.


Individuals may play strategies that are not rationalizable if they don't believe the other player(s) is/are rational, or don't believe the other players believe others are rational, etc.
They may also have limited cognitive power to compute a rationalizable strategy, or this may be too costly to justify the benefit.

In May 2016, an economist (Al) advises Betty that if the UK votes 'leave' in the June referendum, this may reduce trade with France.

\includegraphics[height=4.5in]{substincomefx0.png}

The above diagram depicts the impact of a fall in price of good X for some person.

a. What is the substitution effect of this price change on consumption of X? What is the income effect? Explain.

\begin{solution}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Substitution effect: $X^*$ $\rightarrow$ $X_B$: lowest-cost way to obtain original utility with new price ratio
    \item Income effect: $X_B$ $\rightarrow$ $X^{**}$: greater effective-income at new price, higher utility
  \end{itemize}
\end{solution}

\

b. Is good X a 'normal good' or an inferior good? Explain how we know and what this means.

\begin{solution}
Normal good: consume more at higher (effective income) with same price ratio; income effect positive.
\end{solution}

\

c. Suppose that at the same time as the price change, this person's income were reduced so that, at the new prices he could exactly afford his original consumption and no more.  Depict this budget constraint graphically. Depict her consumption choice at this (third) budget constraint.  Would this combination of a price reduction and income reduction make her better or worse off? Explain.

\begin{solution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Graphically depict a budget line parallel to the new budget constraint going through point A, the original consumption point]
    \item [Depict an additional indifference curve that touches this new budget line at a single point 'D'; that point will be the choice after the price reduction and income reduction]
    \item [referring to diagram] This income reduction is not large enough to completely reverse the impact of the price reduction. Although she could choose the original point A, now that the price ratio has changed, she prefers D, which gives her higher utility. She can \textit{substitute} towards the good with the lower price.
    \item [You could also note that this budget line lies above the dashed budget line, implying it gives her more effective income than the level which leaves her only as well off as initially]

d. Suppose the government is considering reducing the basic allowance to senior citizens while keeping them `just as well off' in response to a large a decrease in fuel costs.  What are the implications of the above analysis for this?

\begin{solution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If the government merely reduced the allowance so that a senior could afford her original bundle, she would still be better off than before the fuel cost reduction.
  \item She could substitute towards consuming more fuel relative to her original consumption.
  \item So if the government wants her 'no better off' it might reduce the allowance \textit{even more}
  \item (But to know exactly how much, it would have to know her utility function, and how she trades off fuel and other goods)

See figure above for first part of this. His new consumption is $q_A^{2017}$ for ale and $q_B^{2017}$ for Beemster. Note that the students' diagram could yield different results; ale (or Beemster) could be normal, inferior or even Giffen. \

\includegraphics[height=3.5in]{b2bii.png}

See figure above for second part of this. In the above diagram the substitution effect moves Beemster consumption from 50,000 to $q_B^{subst}$ (movement along the same indifference curve at the new price ratio; minimum cost basket that yields original utility with new prices.) The income effect moves Beemster consumption from $q_B^{subst}$ to $q_B^{2017}$.

As the income effect is in the opposite direction as the price change, Beemster is a normal good for Nigel. At lower levels of purchasing power (utility) Nigel purchases less of this good.

Note that the students' diagram could yield different results; ale (or Beemster) could be normal, inferior or even Giffen.
\end{solution}

\part (7 marks)
Claiming he has been harmed by the exit, Nigel demands compensation from the government. He asks for an income supplement that would allow him to purchase the same basket of goods that he purchased in 2016.

\begin{itemize}
\item How much would this compensation be?
\item Depict his choices and his new utility level if he were to receive this level of compensation, using a similar graph as above.
\item Would this make Nigel better off, worse off, or the same as he was originally (before the exit from the political-economic union and before the compensation)? Explain in under 30 words, making reference to the diagram.
\item In under 30 words, explain the implications of this for a consumer price index (CPI) that is based on a fixed basket of consumption.
\end{itemize}

%\item What level of compensation would make Nigel equally as well off as he was originally? Explain in under 30 words, referring to the above diagram.

\begin{solution}
To purchase 50,000 units of each good, as in 2017, Nigel now needs $50,000 \times \pounds1$ to buy the ale, and $50,000 \times \pounds2$ to buy the Beemster. Thus, he needs \pounds150000 in income, or a compensation of \pounds50,000.

\includegraphics[height=3.5in]{2Bc.png}

His budget constraint, choices, and new utility level are depicted in purple. Note the Y-intercept is 150,000 units of ale. His new utility is $U^{comp}$, which exceeds his original utility $U1$. (Although he could buy the original basket, at this level of compensation he now has baskets available to him that allow him to attain much more ale than originally, without sacrificing much cheese.) \

A CPI based on a fixed basket ignores substitution possibilities. Thus it may overestimate inflation and overcompensate for nonuniform changes in prices.

Would it lead to higher social welfare? Discuss this from an economics and behavioral economics point of view, making reference to the evidence and theory discussed in Slonim et al's ""The Market for Blood"" (2014). (Obviously this paper refers to a different context, but key principles may carry over. You are encouraged to cite any other research that may be relevant to this question.)

\begin{solution}

Some key points:

Classical economics predicts that without allowing positive prices we will have underprovision of organs.
People may value a kidney at \pounds 1 million, others may be willing to donate it for a price of \pounds 100,000 or more, yet no donation would occur. Both would be worse off by a classical model.

Students can be awarded points for demonstrating the efficiency of trade, using models and diagrams from the discussion of general and partial equilibrium.

Issues with paying donors:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Does it crowd out intrinsic motivation?
  \item Does it bring moral hazard and 'select' the wrong, unsafe donors? (Less important for organs perhaps, because these will be more heavily screened and don't go into a general pool)
  \item Is it harmful to the donors (paternalistic idea)
  \item or otherwise 'repugnant'?
\end{itemize}

The student can cite various evidence on how blood donations and voluntary behaviour responds to such incentives in the real world, particularly citing cross country evidence and field experiments. They should be critical in discussing the extent to which this evidence from one context applies to the kidney market.

Please see notes in the handout and online on the Slonim paper. The standard case for this is straightforward, and relies on the standard classical model, incentives leading to efficient provision, prices reflect true costs etc.  However, there are important tradeoffs, including the crowding out of intrinsic motivation and a potential adverse selection problem if blood cannot be perfectly screened. Also, a paternalist motivation might argue for protecting people from donating `too much' blood; this would require a behavioral bias justification.

What, if anything, do these experiments suggest for the real world?  \begin{solution}  Key Points:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Significant cooperation/contributions (counter dominant-strategy prediction)

A major explanation for the determinants and patterns of contribution involves reciprocity and conditional  cooperation; people contribute more when they believe others will contribute more, and these beliefs may change over time and with different environments.   Other theories include reputation-seeking, team reasoning, and aversion to lying.

Social scientists differ  about the generalisability of lab experiments  to real world situations. (Especially real world collective action problems, voluntary contributions to public goods, and charitable giving.) Issues include the representativeness of lab subjects, the stake sizes, and the artificial nature of the lab, as well as issues of 'experimenter demand'. However, one can make a case that the things that will influence the level of cooperation maybe the same in both contexts such as communication, reputation, and beliefs about others' generosity.

\question[30] \underline{Demand curves} John M. Countryside earns \pounds 100 per week at his summer job and spends his entire weekly income on leeks and chocolate, because these are the only two items that provide utility to him. John gains utility from both of these; his utility is $U(\ell,c)=c^3\ell^4$, where $\ell$ is the number of ounces of leeks he consumes and $c$ the number of ounces of chocolate he consumes.

\begin{parts}

  \part (10 marks) If leeks costs \pounds 2 per ounce and chocolates cost \pounds 1 per ounce, how many will John buy of each in a week? Please show your steps: state the optimisation condition and constraint and then solve. Recall the power rule for derivatives: $\frac{d}{dx}ax^{b}=bax^{b-1}$ where $b\neq0$.

\begin{solution}

$MU_{\ell}=4c^{3}\ell^{3}$

$MU_{c}=3c^{2}l^{4}$

For optimisation (where the second order condition holds, and where we consume some of both so it's not a corner solution; this will be the case here, extra points if anyone mentions this and more if they derive it):

$MU_{\ell}/MU_{c}=MRS=p_{\ell}/p_c$

$\rightarrow\frac{4c^{3}\ell^{3}}{3c^{2}l^{4}}=\frac{2}{1}$

$\rightarrow\frac{c^{3}\ell^{3}}{c^{2}l^{4}}=2\times\frac{3}{4}$

$\rightarrow\frac{c}{\ell}=\frac{3}{2}$

$\rightarrow \ell=\frac{2}{3}c$

Partial credit: We also know the above is a Cobb-Douglas utility function so expenditure shares will be constant and reflect the relative power coefficients; as the coefficient on $\ell$ is 1/3 greater than that of c, we will spend 1/3 more on $\ell$, which, as it is twice as expensive ... this  means buying 2/3 as many units of $\ell$ (note that $2/3 \times 2 = 4/3$, i.e., spending 1/3 more).

Budget constraint: $2\ell+c=100$

Substituting in:

$2\times \frac{2}{3}c +c =100\rightarrow \frac{7}{3}c =100\rightarrow c=100\times\frac{3}{7}$ (about 43)

$\ell=\frac{2}{3}c=\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{3}{7}\times100=\frac{6}{21}\times100$ (about 29)

(Note 3/7=9/21.) /

Check all the budget is spent: $100\times(\frac{9}{21}+2\frac{6}{21})=(21/21)\times 100=100$, and note that 12/21 is 1/3 greater than 9/21, as promised.

\end{solution}

\part (10 marks) For the above example, plot John's budget constraint and several indifference curves (approximately), with chocolate (c) on the vertical axis and leeks ($\ell$) on the horizontal axis. Use this diagram to illustrate the condition for his optimised consumption choice described above.

\begin{solution}
  This diagram is straightforward; downward sloping (at a diminishing rate) dmrs indifference curves that asymptote but never hit the X or Y axes. The optimisation point should be where the price ratio equals the slope of an indifference curve. The budget constraint will be linear, connecting the points $\ell=0,c=100$ and $\ell=50,c=0$, with slope -1/2.
\end{solution}

\part (10 marks) Are leeks a `necessity' for John? I.e., will John consume a positive amount of leeks for \textit{any} positive prices and income? Is chocolate a necessity for John? I.e., will he consume a positive amount of chocolate for \textit{any} positive prices and income? Explain and show why this is (or is not) the case in words, in a diagram, and mathematically, if possible.

\begin{solution}
 Both are neccessities. You can show that the MRS (the amount of one you'd be willing to give up for a unit of the other) goes to infinite as the consumption of either goes to zero. You can make a rough argument for this from the fact that the utility function is multiplicative, so it goes to zero as consumption of either goes to zero This can be illustrated with indifference curves that asymptote but never hit the X or Y axes.

\bigskip

Find the Nash equilibrium of this game. Is this an outcome that maximises the sum of the benefits (for both countries)? Explain.

\begin{solution}
Solving for best responses, we take the FOC (set derivatives equal to 0)

to get $120-s_A-s_B-s_A=0$ $\rightarrow$ $120-2s_A=s_B \rightarrow 2s_A=120-s_B \rightarrow s_A=60-s_B/2$

By symmetry $s_B=60-s_A/2$.

Plugging these in, $s_A=60 - (60-s_A/2)/2 = 60-30+s_A/4 \rightarrow (3/4)s_A = 30 \rightarrow s_A = 120/3=40$
By symmetry $s_A=s_B=24$

Summing the benefits: $s_A(120-s_A-s_B)+s_B(120-s_A-s_B) = 120(s_A+s_B)-s_A^2-s_B^2-2s_As_B = 120(s_A+s_B)-(s_A+s_B)^2$

define_nonsatiation,,,,,,,,,"\question[25] Define the `nonsatiation' property of preferences both formally and intuitively. Why might we expect individuals to have preferences satisfying nonsatiation (or local nonsatiation or a related notion)? What would indifference curves look like if preferences did \textit{not} have this property?


\textit{Note: this question really is asking for three things: a definition, intuition for why this is reasonable, and a discussion of how indifference curves would look in the absence of this. Be sure you answer all parts of the question (but also keep track of time and length).}

\textit{Note 2: the answer I give below is of course more comprehensive and longer than I expect from you to produce on the midterm. I am trying to give you a broad explanation here.}

There are several versions of this general 'more is better' property (global non-satiation, local non-satiation, monitor the city); I just wanted you to define one of them. The strong condition discussed in NS is 'global nonsatiation' or 'more is always better.'

A somewhat 'weaker' (thus more plausible) assumption is 'local nonsatiation'. Intuitive definition: starting from any consumption point, there is some good such that increasing the amount of this good by a tiny
amount will yield a preferred point. Formally,

$$ Y' \succ X \ if \ Y>>X $$ where Y and X are vectors of goods (consumption bundles $Y_1...Y_k$ and $X_1...X_k$) and $>>$ means $Y_j >= X_j \forall j \in 1..k$ and $Y_j>X_j$ for at least one good indexed by $j$.

\

We expect that most individuals can never be fully satiated. No matter what their consumption bundle (which arguably could include charitable giving and gifts to friends and family) there is always some augmentation to it that they would prefer. Even if they completely were to satiate on a single good, there is something else that they would still gain benefit from. This seems plausible to me, at least for most people. (I don't know of any further justification for this.)

This will yield results like ’people will spend all of their wealth’ and (roughly) 'people will never buy a
more expensive bundle when a cheaper bundle is preferred.’

If this did not hold, i.e., if there were satiation, there might be a single point above which further consumption yielded no more value. Suppose, e.g., the person values food and clothing only up to the point were they have some maximal amount of each, and they are indifferent to (do not actively dislike additional amounts, perhaps because they have 'free disposal'). indifference curves would cut off at this point, becoming horizontal and vertical respectively. The entire surface (rectangle above and to the right, going off into infinity) with food> ""food max"" and clothing> ""clothing max"" would be on a single indifference curves (really an ""indifference surface"").

On the other hand, if larger amounts are strictly \textit{worse} than this, there will be a ""bliss point"", and indifference curves would be ellipses around this point.

WARP,,own,,Utility and preferences,,,,,"\begin{minipage}{1.1\linewidth}

\question[27.5] What is the 'weak axiom of revealed preferences'? Illustrate a case (using budget constraints) where this is violated. Explain why we might \textit{not} expect such a violation to typically occur. Can this be tested in an experiment? Explain.

\bigskip

\begin{solution}

X is 'revealed preferred to Y' (X RP Y) if bundle X is chosen given a budget set where Y was also affordable. The WARP states that if X RP Y we must not have that Y RP X. This implies that if X and Y are chosen under distinct budget sets, and people are spending all their income, X must be more expensive than Y (and thus unaffordable) in the case where X is chosen, and vice versa.

If we do not have a broad range of indifference (e.g., dmrs everywere along a budget line), and we have nonsatiation, you can see why this seems reasonable.

We can depict a violation this using two intersecting budget lines and consumption choices on each (you can look this up and I will also try to provide an illustration). A clear argument can be made by noting that the point strictly above the consumption choice in one case was available in the other case. That point should be strictly preferred to the point chosen, which is at least weakly preferred to the point \textit{not} chosen from the other decision. (Let may make an illustration of this... I'll get back to you.)

In theory, this could be tested simply by presenting people multiple budget sets to make real choices, telling them that only one will be chosen randomly (if they are 'EU maximisers' we could treat these independent decisions). Such an experiment could involve two actual products (although we cannot be sure if people will resell these), or perhaps more conveniently, two payoffs, each occurring under some state of the world, e.g., each with 50\% probability. We can look for exact violations, where choices are inconsistent between these two budget lines.

Experiments (Sugden; Choi et al..) have tested a stronger axiom, and one that affords a more robust set of tests, namely the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences (GARP), which extends this to a sort of transitivity (if A RP B and B RP C then NOT C RP A). There are reasonable criticisms of such experiments as tests of rationality, or even of the GARP. People's preferences (or, in a stricter model, background goods, as well as beliefs) may change, even over the short period of an experiment, as they learn and rethink and their mood changes. There may also be costs of calculating these (and a mental cost should enter an individual's preferences/utility function); with the small amounts of value being paid per decision in these experiments, it may be optimizing to \textit{not} make exact calculations/accounts.

This depends on whether the good is a Giffen good or a non-Giffen good. For a  Giffen good the quantity demanded will increase, while for Normal good or for an inferior (but non-Giffen) it will decrease. (Note that there is very little empirical evidence for actual Giffen goods.)

A good will only be Giffen if it is inferior, and it has a very large income effect, which overwhelms the substitution effect. This is only 'likely' to occur if the good accounts for large share of income. (See the Slutsky decomposition for further insight.)

\bigskip

\begin{solution}

We can only identify the supply curve through shift in the demand curve (draw this). This is the main point. Merely observing a collection of 'quantity, price' points, e.g., a month-to-month report from the tuna exchange, tells us only, at best, about the equilibrium point of the supply and demand functions at that time. It does not isolate the supply curve..

We would want to find data from a period in which we expect the supply curve to be fairly constant (elaborate on this ... constant cost conditions etc), but we know the demand curve is varying. Alternatively, we may have ""instruments"" for ""shifts"" in the demand curve. (In theory, one could also run a field experiment where different prices were presented to suppliers, but this would be very hard to implement.)

In the market for tuna we might expect there to be something close to perfect competition among suppliers; however, note that if this was a monopoly or oligopoly, there actually is no such thing as a ""supply curve""; quantity supplied does not respond in a straightforward way to price, as firms are paying close attention to the slope of the demand curve, which implies a marginal revenue..

There may be other approaches to identifying the supply curve. If we had evidence on the cost conditions, we know that, in the long run, the price will follow the average cost at a particular level of production. However, it is very difficult to estimate an industry's cost curve.

The price of the good in the long run could increase, decrease, or stay the same in response to this outward shift in the demand curve. Yes, the \textit{long-run} supply curve could even be downward sloping! This depends on what happens to the average cost curve of the industry at a higher level of quantity.

\bigskip

\begin{solution}

This is extensively discussed in the handout and linked references. The basic point (which I illustrated in the lecture) is that a fixed-basket (Lespeyeres) CPI will overstate the rate of inflation, as it ignores substitution possibilities. Otoh, simply 'adjusting to the price of the new basket' (the Paasche measure) comparing how much this costs now to how much it cost in the previous, will understate the rate of inflation, as it assumes that these substitutions could not have made the individual any worse off. The 'true' CPI (as measured by compensating variation, equivalent, variation or consumer surplus) is in between these two measures.

If you choose this question, answer ALL  PARTS (a-c).

\begin{parts}

\part[15] State the consumer's \textit{general} optimisation problem. Depict this graphically for the case of \textit{perfect complements},  using  indifference curve(s) and a budget constraint.

\
\part[15] Now suppose a consumer's utility function over the two goods she can consume is $U(x,y)=2\sqrt x+y-10$.  State the optimisation condition(s) for this consumer (considering this specific utility function) as a function of her income $I$ and prices $p_x$ and $p_y$.

\textit{Hints:} These will involve her `marginal rate of substitution'. Be sure to consider corner solutions. Recall that $\frac{\partial \sqrt x }{\partial x} = \frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}$.

\
\begin{solution}

State the Lagrangian, (ideally the Kuhn-Tucker one with complementary slackness conditions) and solve.  Or just recall that $MRS(x,y)=p_x/p_y$ as long as the corner outcomes do not yield greater utility (briefly explain/justify this).

\textcolor{gray}{Bonus points for noting/proving that this is a concave problem so we do not need to consider second order conditions.}

$MU(x)=x^{-1/2}$ and $MU(y)=1$. \textcolor{gray}{(The '-10' is a red herring)}

$MRS(x,y)= MU(x)/MU(y) = \frac{1/\sqrt x}{1}=x^{-1/2}$. \textcolor{gray}{Check this is reasonable: the more x I have the smaller this becomes, thus the less y I am willing to give up to gain a unit of x. OK.}

The interior optimisation conditions are thus

\begin{enumerate}
\item $x^{-1/2} = p_x/p_y$ (i.e., $x^{\ast}=(p_x/p_y)^{-2}=(p_y/p_x)^{2}$.  \textcolor{gray}{(Does this make sense?  Maybe; we do have x declining in $p_x$.)}  \textit{and}
\item the budget-balance condition $p_x x+p_y y=I$.
\end{enumerate}

\textcolor{gray}{Also note that we can be sure that she will spend all her income because this utility function illustrates nonsatiation ... its partial derivative is positive everywhere, wrt both arguments.}

If we substitute the first condition into the second, we get

$p_x(p_y/p_x)^2+p_y y=I$ $\rightarrow$  $p_y^{2}/p_x+p_y y=I$  $\rightarrow$ $p_y y=I-p_y^{2}/p_x$
 $\rightarrow y^{\ast}= \frac{I}{p_y}-\frac{p_y}{p_x}$.

So she always spends $I-p_y y^{\ast} = I - I + \frac{p_y^{2}}{p_x}=\frac{p_y^{2}}{p_x}$  on $x$, i.e., she buys $x^{\ast}=(\frac{p_y}{p_x})^{2}$ units of $x$ \textit{no matter her income (!)}, as long as we are not at a corner solution, and she spends  the rest of  her income (if any remains) on $y$.

\textcolor{gray}{Note that this is a \textit{quasilinear} utility function; linear in one of its arguments and (in this case) concave in the other argument. In such cases the individual consumes the 'concave' good, the one with diminishing MU until its 'bang for the buck' declines to that of the other good, and then spends the rest of her income on the other ('linear utility'... or 'numeraire' good).}

\end{solution}

\part[15] Are either, both, or neither of these goods \textit{absolute necessities} (defined here as goods that an individual will choose a positive amount of for any positive prices and income)? Explain. Under what prices and income will this consumer consume \textit{none} of good y? Derive this mathematically and depict this (including depicting the point where she consumes none of good y) using indifference curves and a budget constraint.  Explain.

\textit{Note: If you cannot depict this for this particular utility function, you may gain partial credit for graphing an arbitrary comparable case where the individual consumes only one of the two goods, and explaining this.}

\begin{solution}
We solved for $x^{\ast}=(\frac{p_y}{p_x})^{2}$, regardless of income. Thus as long as $y$ has a positive price, she will buy some amount of x.
However, the first (and every) unit of y yields utility at rate $y$, and the  MU of x is $1/\sqrt x$. This is extremely large for the first few units of $x$. Thus, for at least low levels of expenditure,  the 'bang for the buck' for x: $1/p_x\sqrt x$, must exceed the `bang for the buck' for y: $y/p_y$. Thus, for low levels of income, she may not purchase $y$. It is not an absolute  necessity.

We also see this in our previous solution,  $y^{\ast}= \frac{I}{p_y}-\frac{p_y}{p_x}$.  If $I \leq \frac{p_y^{2}}{p_x}$, i.e., for a lower income and a higher relative price of $p_y$, she will buy no $p_y$.

This utility function is quasilinear.  Indifference curves show diminishing MRS, but (noting $MRS=x^{-1/2}$)  these have the same slopes for any value of y wherever x is held constant, i.e., along vertical lines. Thus these indifference curves look all look the same, just shifted up vertically from one another.

To demonstrate the point where she consumes no y, we draw a budget constraint with a slope that is everywhere shallower than the indifference curves that go through it, and draw the indifference curve beginning at the point where this hits the horizontal axis.

\textbf{If you choose this question answer \emph{all} parts (a), (b), and (c).}

Suppose a principal ($P$) delegates production to an agent ($A$), and pays the agent $t(q)$ to produce $q$ units. Production incurs no fixed cost and a constant marginal cost, so that total cost $c(q) = \theta q$. The marginal cost, $\theta$, can take two values, $\underline{\theta}$ and $\overline{\theta}$. Let $prob(\theta=\underline{\theta})=\nu \in (0,1)$.

Assume $0<\underline{\theta}<\overline{\theta}<1$.

Assume that $A$'s reservation utility is zero, and:
\begin{align*}
U_{P}(q)  & =S(q)-t(q)=ln(q)-t(q)\\

\part (15 points) What does it mean for the principal to `implement a separating contract' in this context? What does an `information rent' mean in this context? If the principal chooses to implement a separating contract, which type of agent (if any) will get an information rent, and why?

\bigskip 

\begin{solution}

 In a separating contract, the principal induces each type of agent to (self-selects to) produce a different amount and is paid a different amount. \ The
low-cost agent is paid an information rent to get her to produce more, i.e., to keep her from accepting the contract meant for the high-cost type. \ We
could show that the PC\_high is binding, and this will imply that if the low-cost type were to accept the high-cost type's contract she could do it
at lower cost and get a positive profit. \ Thus, to accept the contract meant for the low-cost type, she must also get a positive profit, the
`information rent.' \ It is called an `information rent' because it can be seen as a payment required to get the low-cost type to reveal her
information about cost -- if no such reward were given, she would rather remain `incognito.'

Remember that when this contract is implemented the low-cost type \textit{does} produce more than the high-cost type. 

\end{solution}

\part (20 points) Assuming the principal wants to implement an `interior, separating equilibrium', describe the principal's constrained optimization problem for the case described above. In doing so, explain what you mean by `participation constraints' and `incentive compatibility' constraints.

\bigskip
\begin{solution}

By `interior' we mean both types of agent produce a positive amount. Thus the principal must get two types of agent to prefer to accept the contract: two ``participation constraints.'' He must also get each to prefer choose the (distinct) output intended for them: two ``incentive compatibility constraints.''

We know that to induce an interior separating contract with participation we need to only worry about the low-cost type's IC constraint and the high-cost
type's PC constraint; these are the \textit{binding} constraints, and the others are `slack.' (Note that the information  rent argument suffices to show that PC(low cost) is slack; the proof that IC(high cost) is slack is longer. Neither are required here.) \ Hence, we require


\begin{equation*}
t_{hc} - \overline{\theta} q_{hc} \geq 0  \tag{PC-high}
\end{equation*}

and
\begin{equation*}
t_{lc} - \underline{\theta} q_{lc} \geq t_{hc} - \underline{\theta} q_{hc} \tag{IC-low}
\end{equation*}

Since these are binding, they hold strictly, implying:

\begin{equation*}
t_{hc} = \overline{\theta} q_{hc}  \tag{PC-high}
\end{equation*}

and

\begin{eqnarray*}
t_{lc} = t_{hc} - \underline{\theta} q_{hc} + \underline{\theta} q_{lc} \notag \\
&=&  (\overline{\theta} - \underline{\theta}) q_{hc} +   \underline{\theta} q_{lc}
\end{eqnarray*}

Substituting this into the principal's optimization problem we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
U_{pr}^{SB} &=&\max_{q,q_{lc}}E_{\theta }(ln(q(\theta))-t(\theta )) \\
&=&\max_{q,q_{lc}} \nu \left( ln(q_{lc})-\left( (\overline{\theta}-\underline{\theta})q_{hc}+ \underline{\theta} q_{lc} \right) \right)+ (1-\nu)\left(ln(q_{hc})-\overline{\theta}q_{hc}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

Where $\nu$ is the probability of a low cost type agent.
\end{solution}

\part (15 points) Describe the contract that the principal will set for the case described in part (b). Derive an expression for the principal's profit. Will either type of agent produce the technically efficient amount? Explain why or why not. Will this cause a loss of social surplus relative to a case where the agent's cost of production is common knowledge? Explain.

\begin{solution}
Taking the FOC's of this concave problem:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \frac{dU_{pr}}{dq_{lc}} &=& \nu \Big(\frac{1}{q{_{lc}}}-\underline{\theta}\Big) = 0 \\
  \frac{dU_{pr}}{dq_{hc}} &=& (1-\nu)\left(  \frac{1}{q{_{hc}}}-\overline{\theta} \right) - \nu (\overline{\theta}-\underline{\theta})  = 0
\end{eqnarray*}

The lower (lowest) cost agent will always be induced to produce the efficient amount. In considering an increase in the low-cost type's output, the principal is trading off the actual benefit of the output to the principal, against the increased costs to the agent that must be compensated. This is the condition for efficiency. Although the low-cost agent will get a surplus (information rent) if the high-cost agent is assigned a positive quantity, this surplus does not depend on the amount assigned to the low-cost type. On the other hand, when the principal increases the amount assigned to the high-cost type, he not only has to compensate the high-cost type's cost, he must also increase the information rent paid to the low cost type; thus the high-cost type's output is distorted downwards relative to the first best full-information case. Note that this is because the more output assigned to the high-cost type, the more she must be paid, and thus the more the low cost type has to gain from producing this same output, thus the higher the information rent. (I.e., in the tradeoff that the principal is considering, the 'cost' of the high-cost-types' output to the principal is greater than just the technical cost.)

This \textit{does} cause a loss of social surplus relative to the full information case; if the high-cost type could be identified, the principal would have her produce more, and compensate her for her costs, and also gain additional profit from this.

\bigskip 

Further computation yields:

$ \frac{dU_{pr}}{dq_{hc}} =(1-\nu)\left(  \frac{1}{q{_{hc}}}-\overline{\theta} \right) - \nu (\overline{\theta}-\underline{\theta})  = 0$$\rightarrow$  

%$(1-\nu)\left(  \frac{1}{q{_{hc}}}-\overline{\theta} \right) =\nu (\overline{\theta}-\underline{\theta}) $ $\rightarrow$ 

$\frac{1}{q{_{hc}}}=\overline{\theta}  +\frac{\nu}{1-\nu} (\overline{\theta}-\underline{\theta}) $ $\rightarrow$ 

$q^{sb}{_{hc}} =\big(\overline{\theta}+\frac{\nu}{1-\nu} (\overline{\theta}-\underline{\theta})\big)^{-1} $ $\rightarrow$ 

$  q^{sb}{_{lc}}=\frac{1}{\underline{\theta}}  $


The principal's expected profit is thus:

\begin{eqnarray*}
U_{pr}^{SB} &=& \\
\nu  [ln(\frac{1}{\underline{\theta}})  -  \overline{\theta}\frac{1}{\underline{\theta}} - (\overline{\theta} - \underline{\theta}) q^{sb}_{hc} ] \\
+ (1-\nu)[\left(ln(q^{sb}_{hc})-\overline{\theta}q^{sb}_{hc}\right)]
 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

Substituting the somewhat messy $q^{sb}{_{hc}}$ term if desired

\question[50] \emph{This question is about hidden information in the principal-agent setting.}

\textbf{If you choose this question answer \emph{all} parts (a), (b), and (c).}


Consider a standard hidden-information agency problem in which a principal
hires an agent. \ Define a contract as a pairing of a transfer ($t$) and an
output level ($q$). \ The principal offers a menu of one or more contracts.
The agent knows his type, $\theta \in \{1,2\}$, at the time she is hired.
The probability that $\theta =2$ is $\frac{2}{3}$. This is her private
information. For a given contract $(t,q)$ the agent's utility is $t-\theta
q^{2}$ and the principal's utility is $q-t$. The output level is observable.

\begin{parts}

\part  (15 marks) Suppose the principal can observe the type of the agent before offering
her a contract. Solve for the contract that the principal will write and
find the resulting payoffs.

\begin{solution}

{\small Suggested answer:\ In the full-information case, the principal,
knowing }$\theta ${\small , maximizes }$q-t${\small \ over }$q${\small \ and
}$t${\small \ subject to the constraint that }$t-\theta q^{2}\geq 0$

{\small (i.e., subject to the constraint that the agent participate).}

{\small Clearly, the constraint binds --- the principal wishes to make }$t$%
{\small \ as small as possible --- so the problem is equivalent to the
unconstrained problem}

\begin{equation*}
\max_{q}{\small (q-\theta q}^{2}{\small )}
\end{equation*}

{\small The solution to which is }$q^{FB}(\theta )=\frac{1}{2\theta }$

{\small Hence, }$t^{FB}(\theta )=\frac{1}{4\theta }${\small .}

{\small \bigskip }

{\small I.e.,}

\begin{eqnarray*}
q^{FB}(\underline{\theta }) &=&\frac{1}{2\underline{\theta }}=\frac{1}{2} \\
t^{FB}(\underline{\theta }) &=&\frac{1}{4\underline{\theta }}=\frac{1}{4}
\end{eqnarray*}

{\small and}

\begin{eqnarray*}
q^{FB}(\bar{\theta}) &=&\frac{1}{2\bar{\theta}}=\frac{1}{4} \\
t^{FB}(\bar{\theta}) &=&\frac{1}{4\bar{\theta}}=\frac{1}{8}.
\end{eqnarray*}

{\small Payoffs yield zero surplus to each agent, and a (principal's) profit
of: }%
\begin{eqnarray*}
U_{pr}^{FB} &=&\frac{1}{3}\left( q_{lc}-t_{lc}\right) +\frac{2}{3}\left(
q-t_{hc}\right)  \\
&=&\frac{1}{3}(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4})+\frac{2}{3}(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{8})=%
\frac{1}{6}
\end{eqnarray*}

{\small Note: Another way of stating this is that these contracts need only
meet the participation constraints -- the incentive compatibility
constraints can be trivially satisfied through a `forcing contract'. }$PC(%
\underline{\theta }):t_{lc}-\underline{\theta }\underline{q}^{2}\geq 0;$%
{\small \ }$PC(\bar{\theta}):t_{hc}-\bar{\theta}\bar{q}^{2}\geq 0${\small .
It is trivial to see that these constraints will both bind.}

{\small \ Hence, the contract: }$t_{lc}=t(q=\frac{1}{4\underline{\theta }}%
|\theta =\underline{\theta })=\frac{1}{8},${\small \ }$t(q\neq \frac{1}{4%
\underline{\theta }}|\theta =\underline{\theta })=-\infty ${\small \ and }$%
t_{hc}=t(q=\frac{1}{4\bar{\theta}}|\theta =\bar{\theta})=\frac{1}{4},$%
{\small \ }$t(q\neq \frac{1}{4\theta }|\theta =\bar{\theta})=-\infty $%
{\small \ }$\ ${\small will be optimal.}

{\small \bigskip }

\end{solution} 

\part (25 marks) Now assume the principal does not observe the agent's type, but knows the
probability of the agent being of each type. Find the optimal menu of
contracts for the principal to offer. Find the resulting payoffs. Remember
to check shut-down and pooling contracts. Show how you obtained your answer.
\ Note: you do not need to give a proof of which constraints bind and which
are slack, you can merely cite a general rule.

\begin{solution}

{\small Separating case}

{\small We know that to induce a separating contract with participation we
need to only worry about the low-cost type's IC constraint and the high-cost
type's PC constraint; these are the binding constraints, and the others are
`slack.' \ Hence, we require:}

\begin{equation}
{\small t_{hc}-2q_{hc}}^{2}{\small \geq 0}  \tag{PC-high}
\end{equation}

{\small and}%
\begin{equation}
t_{lc}-q_{lc}^{2}\geq t_{hc}-q_{hc}^{2}  \tag{IC-low}
\end{equation}

{\small \bigskip }

{\small Since these are binding, they hold strictly, implying:}

\begin{equation*}
{\small t_{hc}=2q_{hc}}^{2}
\end{equation*}

{\small and}%
\begin{eqnarray}
t_{lc} &=&t_{hc}-q_{hc}^{2}+q_{lc}^{2}  \notag \\
&=&2q_{hc}^{2}-q_{hc}^{2}+q_{lc}^{2} \\
&=&q_{hc}^{2}+q_{lc}^{2}
\end{eqnarray}

{\small Substituting this into the principal's optimization problem we get:}

\begin{eqnarray*}
U_{pr}^{SB} &=&\max_{q,q_{lc}}E_{\theta }(q(\theta )-t(\theta )) \\
&=&\max_{q,q_{lc}}\frac{1}{3}(q_{lc}-q_{hc}^{2}-q_{lc}^{2})+\frac{2}{3}%
\left( q_{hc}-2q^{2}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

{\small Taking the FOC's of this concave problem:}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dU_{pr}}{dq_{lc}} &=&\frac{1}{3}-\frac{2}{3}q_{lc}=0 \\
&\Rightarrow &q_{lc}^{SB}=\frac{1}{2}=q^{FB}(\underline{\theta })
\end{eqnarray*}%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dU_{pr}}{dq_{hc}} &=&-\frac{2}{3}q_{hc}+\frac{2}{3}-\frac{8}{3}q_{hc}=0
\\
&\Rightarrow &q_{hc}^{SB}=\frac{1}{5}
\end{eqnarray*}

{\small Expected profits can be solved for:}

\begin{eqnarray*}
t_{hc} &=&q_{hc}^{2}\times \bar{\theta}=\frac{1}{5}^{2}\times 2=\frac{2}{25}
\\
t_{lc} &=&t_{hc}-q_{hc}^{2}+q_{lc}^{2}=\frac{2}{25}-\frac{1}{25}+\frac{1}{2}%
^{2}=\frac{1}{25}+\frac{1}{4}=0.29 \\
U_{pr}^{SB} &=&\frac{1}{3}\left( q_{lc}-t_{lc}\right) +\frac{2}{3}%
(q_{hc}-t_{hc}) \\
&=&\frac{1}{3}\left( \frac{1}{2}-\frac{29}{100}\right) +\frac{2}{3}(\frac{1}{%
5}-\frac{2}{25})=\frac{3}{20}
\end{eqnarray*}

{\small Which is lower than in the full-information case.}

\bigskip

\end{solution} 

\part  (10 marks) In the context of a standard hidden-information agency problem, what is
an `information rent' and why does it occur? \ If the principal implements a
contract in which both types produce the same amount, will either type get
an information rent? Explain why or why not.

\begin{solution}

{\small Suggested answer:\ If a separating contract is optimal , the
principal is writing a contract in which each type of agent (self-selects
to) produces a different amount and is paid a different amount. \ The
low-cost agent is paid an information rent to get her to produce more, i.e.,
to keep her from accepting the contract meant for the high-cost type. \ We
could show that the PC\_high is binding, and this will imply that if the
low-cost type were to accept the high-cost type's contract she could do it
at lower cost and get a positive profit. \ Thus, to accept the contract
meant for the low-cost type, she must also get a positive profit, the
`information rent.' \ It is called an `information rent' because it can be
seen as a payment required to get the low-cost type to reveal her
information about cost -- if no such reward were given, she would rather
remain `incognito.'}

\begin{solution}
There are two pure-strategy equilibria: in one, both Declare, and in the other, both Rebuff/Ignore. (Can show this through underlining).
\bigskip

Mixed strategy NE occur where each player is indifferent.

Let the probability of declaring be $p$, recognising this is a symmetric game.

Indifference will occur where $10p-10(1-p)=1p+0(1-p) \rightarrow 10p-10+10p=p \rightarrow 19p=10 \rightarrow  p=10/19$. Thus if both players declare with probability 10/19, this will be a mixed-strategy NE.

Depiction of BRF is standard, with three points of intersection.
Payoffs for both players are highest under `Declare, Declare', lower under the MSE, and lowest under `Ignore,Ignore'. In a one-shot, any outcome could be predicted as coordination is not guaranteed. There are arguments for predicting each pure strategy NE profile as an `equilibrium' (refinements). D-D is Pareto-dominant and I-I is a minimax strategy.

NE2 is weakly 'payoff dominant' (only payoff dominant for player 1).
NE2 would seem to be 'risk-dominant' (you can look into this concept more formally).
