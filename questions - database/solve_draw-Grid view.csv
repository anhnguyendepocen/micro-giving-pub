Rick has a utility function $U =  \sqrt{W}$ where W is his wealth expressed in monetary units. Rick's only wealth is a house worth \pounds100,000. In any given year, there is a 10\% chance that the house will burn down. If it does, its value will be \pounds0.

\begin{parts}
\part (2 marks) What is the expected monetary value of Rick's wealth at the end of the year? (5 marks)

\begin{solution}
\pounds90,000

  $0.1 \times 0 + 0.9 \times 100,000 = 80,000$
\end{solution}

\part (7 marks) Would Rick be better off if he could obtain \textit{fair insurance} fully insuring him against a potential loss? Show why or why not using a diagram.

\begin{solution}
Diagram as below (adjust for a 10\% chance of a loss).

\includegraphics[height=3in]{exb1b.png}

Fair insurance costs \pounds10,000, the expected value of the loss. It allows Rick to have \pounds90,000 for certain, yielding utility $U_2$, which exceeds his EU from a .1 probability of 0 income and a .9 probability of \pounds100,000 income, which is $U_1$.
\end{solution}

\part  (8 marks) What is the maximal amount that Rick would be willing to pay to insure his house against being destroyed by fire? Does paying this amount leave him with more, less, or the same expected utility as no insurance? Show this using a diagram.

\begin{solution}

With no insurance his utility is
$0.1 \times \sqrt(0) + 0.9 \times \sqrt(100,000) $

The certain income that yields this utility satisfies
$\sqrt{y}=0.9*\sqrt(100000) \rightarrow \sqrt(y) = 81000$
Thus he would be willing to pay up to \pounds19,000 for this insurance.

Diagram as below (note curvature below is not quite right, adjust for the 81,000 point).

\includegraphics[height=3in]{exb1c.png}
\end{solution}

\part (9 marks) Consider the `game' described below.

i. in the first period a risk-neutral insurance agent makes a `take it or leave it offer' of an insurance rate to Rick and

ii. in the second period Rick can either accept or reject this offer.

What is the subgame-perfect equilibrium of this sequential game? How might the results change if Rick had fairness preferences? For the results to change, is it necessary that Rick's fairness preferences be common knowledge?

\begin{solution}
  BWI: Period 2 - Rick would accept any offer at or above \pounds19000. Period 1 - The agent would thus offer \pounds19000. (18999 should also be an acceptable answer).

With fairness preferences Rick might refuse an offer he thought was unfairly high (or unfairly low). Similar behaviour has been seen in lab ultimatum games. If the agent knew this (which would be implied by common knowledge), the  agent might offer a price somewhat below 19000. Actually, common knowledge is more than needed -- we only need one level of this knowledge, the agent must know Rick's preferences, but Rick doesn't need to know the agent knows this.
\end{solution}

","\question[20] \underline{Uncertainty, risk aversion, insurance, game theory}
Risk-averse Roger has a utility function $U =  \sqrt(W)$ where W is his wealth expressed in monetary units. (Note that this function is increasing at a diminishing rate; its slope is always positive but it is less steeply sloping at larger values). Roger's only wealth is a house worth \pounds100,000. In any given year, there is a 20\% chance that the house will burn down. If it does, its value will be \pounds0.

\begin{parts}
\part What is the expected monetary value of Roger's wealth at the end of the year? (5 marks)

\begin{solution}
\pounds80,000

  $0.2 \times 0 + 0.8 \times 100,000 = 80,000$
\end{solution}
\part Show using a diagram that Roger would be better off if he could obtain \textit{fair insurance} fully insuring him against a potential loss. (5 marks)
\begin{solution}
Diagram as below.

\includegraphics[height=3in]{exb1b.png}

Fair insurance costs \pounds20,000, the expected value of the loss. It allows Roger to have \pounds80,000 for certain, yielding utility $U_2$, which exceeds his EU from a .2 probability of 0 income and a .8 probability of \pounds100,000 income, which is $U_1$.
\end{solution}

\part What is the maximal amount that Roger would be willing to pay to insure his house against being destroyed by fire? Show using a diagram that paying this maximum amount leaves him with the same expected utility as no insurance. (6 marks)

\begin{solution}

With no insurance his utility is
$0.2 \times \sqrt(0) + 0.8 \times \sqrt(100,000) = 8000$

The certain income that yields this utility satisfies
$sqrt{y}=8000 \rightarrow y = 64000$
Thus he would be willing to pay up to \pounds36,000 for this insurance.

Diagram as below (note curvature below is not quite right, so the 64000 is too much to the left).

\includegraphics[height=3in]{exb1c.png}
\end{solution}
\part Consider the `game' described below.

i. in the first period a risk-neutral insurance agent makes a `take it or leave it offer' of an insurance rate to Roger and

ii. in the second period Roger can either accept or reject this offer.

What is the subgame-perfect equilibrium of this sequential game? How might the results change if either party had fairness preferences? (5 marks)

\begin{solution}
  BWI: Period 2 - Roger would accept any offer at or above \pounds36000. Period 1 - The agent would thus offer \pounds36000. (35999 should also be an acceptable answer).

With fairness preferences Roger might refuse an offer he thought was unfairly high (or unfairly low). Similar behaviour has been seen in lab ultimatum games. Anticipating this, the agent might offer a price somewhat below 36000.

monopolyversusperfectcomp_diagram,Monopoly,Solve/draw,"\question[8] \textcolor{gray}{\textit{Please answer in no more than half a  side of a page.}} Consider the figure below, depicting the demand curve (which equals the marginal benefit curve: MB), a firm's marginal revenue (MR), and a firm's constant marginal cost (MC) to produce a particular good. (ATC represents the average total cost.) Consider the situation described by this figure. Compare what would happen if production of this good were monopolised to what would happen if this good were produced under perfect competition. Explain briefly what the differences would be in price, profit, consumer surplus, and  total welfare.

\includegraphics[height=3in]{monopoly_example.png}

\begin{solution}
A monopoly would maximise its profit by charging a price of about 2.75  while firms under perfect competition would charge a price of 2.
A monopoly would earn a positive profit, while firms under perfect competition would gain no profit in the long run.  Consumer surplus would be larger under perfect competition.
