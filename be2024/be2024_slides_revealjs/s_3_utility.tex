Consider a decision you recently made?

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Define this decision clearly.
\item
  How do you think you decided among these options?
\end{itemize}

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the
same decision?

If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same
situation again. Do you think you'd make the same decision?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

Suppose I asked you

`State a rule that governs (determines/characterizes) how people
\emph{do} make decisions'\ldots{}

\bigskip

I want this rule to be\ldots{}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Informative (it rules \emph{out} at least some sets of choices)
\item
  Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule)
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

Similar question:

`State a rule that governs how people \emph{should} make decisions'..

\bigskip

By `should' I mean that \emph{they will not regret having made decisions
in this way.}

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\Huge If people \emph{did} follow these rules, what would this imply and
predict? \normalsize

Rules defined as `axioms about preferences'

`Standard axioms' \(\rightarrow\) (imply that) choices can be expressed
by `individuals maximising \emph{utility functions} subject to their
\emph{budget constraints}'

\(\rightarrow\) yields predictions for individual behavior, markets,
etc.

Economists and decision theorists have tried to come up with and defend
such rules.

They have started from these `reasonable axioms' and follow their
logical implications for \textCR individual choices, individual
responses to changes in prices and income,

market prices and quantities and their responses,

`welfare' and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc.

\protect\hypertarget{utility}{}

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Utility]
``The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic
activity.''
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[ \bigskip]
Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions
\end{description}

Adv: There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of
utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature

Adv: A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that
decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared
and evaluated,

thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, `utility', which is
maximised

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\emph{How is this used?}

\bigskip

Utility will be expressed as a single number that arises from the
combination of all goods and services consumed.

\bigskip

Essentially, economists assume that `when making a choice among all
available and feasible options, an individual will choose the one that
yields the greatest \emph{utility}'

\begin{block}{Utility from two goods}

\[Utility = U(X,Y; other)\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Leisure and `goods consumption'
\item
  Food and non-food
\item
  Coffee and tea (holding all else constant)
\end{itemize}

\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\[Utility = U(X,Y)\]

\bigskip

\textcolor{blue}{Maths revision}: \(U(X,Y)\) expresses a \emph{function}
with two \emph{arguments}, X and Y.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(U(X,Y)\) must take \emph{some} value for every positive value of X
  and Y.
\end{itemize}

In \emph{general} a function of X and Y might increase or decrease in
either X or Y,

or increase over some ranges and decrease over other ranges of these two
arguments.

Consider the function `altitude of land in Britain as a function of
degrees longitude and latitude'

This expresses a \emph{general} function; I haven't specified
\emph{what} this function is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  E.g., it could be \(U(X,Y)=\sqrt(XY)\)
\end{itemize}

We can consider functions in general having certain properties without
specifying exactly what these functions are.

\begin{block}{Measuring and comparing utilities}

Adv: This is a difficult but well-studied issue, as it is important for
methodology and welfare analysis.

In more detailed discussions, we might speak of `cardinal utility',
`ordinal utility', etc.,

to indicate ways we can compare utility between individuals and in
response to policy changes.

Utility is not `observable and measurable in utils'

(Unlike midi-chlorians or thetans)

\bigskip

Utility is seen to govern an individual's \emph{choices} and thus it's
only inferred indirectly, from the \emph{choices} people make

\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\textbf{Revealed preference:} if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a
dog was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat

\begin{figure}

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{picsfigs/babytakingfood}

\end{figure}

As we only get at utility through an \emph{individual's} decisions, we
have no reliable way to compare it across individuals

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Standard assumptions about preferences (`axioms')}
\protect\hypertarget{standard-assumptions-about-preferences-axioms}{}

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Completeness
\end{enumerate}

Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer
or whether they find both options equally attractive.

The more formal and parsimonious definition (Autor readings, Jehle/Reny)
develop this from a single relation `weakly preferred to'.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\item
  Transitivity (internal consistency)
\end{enumerate}

If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  More is Better (\emph{nonsatiation})
\end{enumerate}

Completeness and transitivity (and continuity) are necessary for
people's choices to be represented by (continuous) \emph{utility
functions}

Continuity is necessary for `well behaved' (not-jumpy) demand curves

(Local) Nonsatiation will help us derive results

If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer an
Apple to a Cherry.

A similar idea holds if I am indifferent between one pair of these.

If this seems confusing it may be because it is \emph{too} obvious
(although behavioral and experimental economists claim to find
violations).

preferred an apple to a banana, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an
apple,

you could make a lot of money out of them!

The darkly shaded area represents those combinations of X and Y that are

silly to say people \emph{actually} consult a utility function.

The indifference curve offers some intuition.

Individual ok giving up soda for hamburgers or v/v \emph{along}
indifference curve

A trade that put them \emph{above} the IC makes them `strictly' better
off

\emph{Consider if one individual had D and another A, and they had the
same preferences.}

Line between two bundles: all `convex combinations' of these,

In normal-speak, a partial share of each bundle.

Note with the same DMRS for both, trades along this line make both
better off;

the \emph{points} they would trade to depends on their bargaining power

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Marginal rate of substitution (MRS)}

MRS = Absolute value of slope of indifference curve

\bigskip

`Rate at which you're willing to forgo consuming (\(Y\)) to consume one
more (\(X\))'

2024, Adv, math: This slope will equal the negative of the \emph{ratio}
of the rate at which utility increases in each good (partial
derivative).

Intuition: giving up a certain utility from one good must be balanced by
an increase in utility from the other good.

\begin{block}{Preference for variety/balance}

\includegraphics{picsfigs/indifcurvebalance.png}\\

Adv: this `preference for variety' is thought to hold for most
combinations of goods, most of the time, but perhaps not for all
pairings.

It tends to lead to easy-to-solve `interior solutions' where people may
consume some amount of each good, and have smooth reactions to price
changes.

Extreme of this is `necessity' goods.

LC: Adjust previous picture on visualiser/board

With an indifference curve with this shape (`convex')

any consumption bundle that represents a `mixture' between two equally
attractive extremes will be preferred to those extremes

E.g., if I like bundles A and D equally, I prefer a bundle of 1/3 of a
and 2/3 of D to either A or D.

Slope \(-Px/Py\): How much \(Y\) I must sacrifice to get another unit of
\(X\).

To get another \(X\) it costs me \(P_xX\), so the more costly is \(X\)
the more \(Y\) I must give up.

For each \(Y\) I give up I save \(P_Y\), so the more costly is \(Y\) the
more I can save by giving up 1 unit of it,

thus, the less I need to sacrifice of \(Y\) to get another unit of
\(X\).

Careful: it is very easy to get this slope ratio backwards!

However, I'll try not to make such errors too costly on the assessments.

If this didn't hold true and you were spending on both goods,

you would be paying `more per util' for one good than the other,

and thus should reallocate to that other good.

The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point

-- the higher is MU\_x -- the more Y I'm willing to give up to get it.

That is why MU\_x is in the numerator. The more valuable a bit more Y is
at that point -- the higher is MU\_y -- the less Y I am willing to give
up to get a bit more X.

That is why MU\_y is in the denominator

\begin{block}{Perfect substitutes, but not identical, e.g.,}

This may be confusing.

By `perfect substitutes' we mean pairs of goods for which \emph{some
amount} of one is always valued the same as \emph{some amount} of the
other,

and this proportion is always the same.

An easy example: I might always be indifferent between three pints of
mild ale and two pints of strong ale,

if they have the same total alcohol content and I only want to get
tipsy.

\[U(X,Y)=4X+3Y\]

Rates each increase utility per-unit (derivative) are constant:
\(MU_X = 4\), \(MU_Y = 3\)

So (for perfect substitutes) buy the one that increases it more
*per-\pounds*

\end{block}

\item
  Rearranging, if \(P_X < 4/3 P_Y\), buy X \ldots{} etc.

Lecture question: come up with an example

Mathematical function example:\\

\textcolor{red}{Warning:} this min function looks backwards, but it's

    determine cost of `1 bundle of the combo' at given prices
  \item

``Min'' function just takes the smaller of the arguments

to max this (not waste money), set the arguments to `min' equal, here
2X=Y

You should be able to do this without having taken economics.

Suppose you were given \pounds100 and asked to spend it to make as many
sausages-with-baps as possible.

No one can eat a sausage without a bap, nor vice-versa. Sausages come in
packs of 4, and baps come in packs of 8. How many packs of each will you
buy,

Supposing both types of packs cost \pounds1 each?

A Cobb-Douglas example

\[ U(X,Y)=\sqrt(XY) \]

LC: We are `allowed' to square the whole thing to simplify the problem.
Why?

\[MU_X = \frac{\partial}{\partial X} (XY)^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} (Y/X)^{1/2}\]

\[MU_Y =  \frac{1}{2} (X/Y)^{1/2}\]

General Cobb-Douglas: \(U(X,Y)=X^a Y^b\) for a, b positive constants

\bigskip

\emph{Here, amount of Y you'd give up to get a unit of X:}

\[MRS(X,Y)= MU_X/MU_Y = Y/X\]

MU\_X is the slope of U(X,Y) in X at a particular point, i.e., the
(partial) derivative with respect to X

The last equality comes from this \emph{particular} function; it is not
always Y/X.

\footnotesize\{Check reasonable: The more Y I've , the more Y I'd give
up to get another X :)\}

This slope is derived through calculus.

Adv, maths:

MU\_X is the slope of U(X,Y) in X at a particular point, i.e., the
(partial) derivative with respect to X

\(MU_X = \frac{\partial</aside>{\partial X} (XY)^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} (XY)^{-1/2}Y = \frac{1}{2} (Y/X)^{1/2}\)

Similarly, \(MU_Y = \frac{1}{2} (X/Y)^{1/2}\).\}

\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\emph{\ldots Cobb-Douglas ctd}

\[MRS(X,Y)= MU_X/MU_Y = Y/X\]

Here utility-maximization requires, at optimal choices of X and Y:
\[MRS(X,Y)= Y/X = P_X/P_Y\]

Check it makes sense.

As P\_X increases the right-hand-side (RHS) increases,

and so to increase the LHS I must increase the units of Y consumed,

and thus decrease the units of X consumed

I say `here' because we now have nice convex indifference curves with
`normal' slopes,

unlike for perfect complements or substitutes.

The more of one good you have the less you value it relative to the
other good (unlike perfect substitutes)

but you still value more of it somewhat (unlike for perfect complements)

For any price ratio, find ratio of Y \& X.

With prices and income, \(I\), find consumption of X \& Y.

Rearranging optimization condition:

\[Y P_Y = X P_X\]

Class question- What is weird about this? Ans: You always spend the same
\emph{amount} on each good, no matter the price

(Note, that doesn't mean the same number of units)

This `constant expenditure shares' are a characteristic of Cobb-Douglas
functions that limit their usefulness and realism

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

Optimization condition for \textcolor{red}{this particular} utility
function:

\[Y P_Y = X P_X\]

Combining this with the budget constraint \[P_X X + P_Y Y = I\]

solve for X \& Y, as fncns of prices \& income (see notes)
\(\rightarrow\)

\medskip

\[Y = I/(2P_Y)\] \[X = I/(2P_X)\]

Rearranging the optimization condition, \(Y = X P_X/P_Y\).\\
From the b.c., \(X = (I - P_Y Y)/P_X\).\\
Substituting in for \(Y\) yields
\(X = (I - P_Y(X P_X / P_Y))/P_X = I/P_X - X\)\\
\(\rightarrow 2X = I/P_X \rightarrow X = I/(2P_X)\)\\
\(X P_X = I / 2 \rightarrow\) always spend half your income on X.\\
Adv: You can solve for the optimal \(Y\) by `symmetry': as utility\\
and budget constraint are symmetric everything we said holds replacing X
with Y.\\
