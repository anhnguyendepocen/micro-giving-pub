### Lecture goals

(Topics in more detail)

1. What are monopolies and what are barriers to entry?
2. How do monopolies choose prices and quantities?
3. What are the social (welfare) consequences of monopoly?

. . .

4. What is 'price discrimination'?
5. what forms can price discrimination take, and how does it increase a monopoly's profits?
6. How does price discrimination affect social welfare, and whom does it help or hurt?
7. (Very brief mention: other forms of imperfect competition)

----


*Rem*: perfect competition

- free entry and exit
    - $\rightarrow$ zero long-run economic profit
- many many tiny firms
    - $\rightarrow$ firms are price takers
- $\rightarrow$ p=mc
    - And in the long run $p=ATC$ and firms produce at $min(AC)$


. . .

\

*these are extreme assumptions; theoretical ideal*

\


. . .


----

Opposite extreme: *monopoly*

- A single firm

. . .

<br> \bigskip


- Barriers to entry $\rightarrow$ No threat of entry


. . .


<br> \bigskip

- Can choose price, which becomes the 'market price'



. . .



Still, the more it charges the fewer units demanded. $\rightarrow$ Chooses a price (or quantity) where MR=MC (like all firms do)


. . .


$\rightarrow$ Produces 'less than socially optimal quantity' in order to charge a high price and increase its profit!

## Barriers to entry

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("midvale.png")
```

----

### Technical barriers to entry

- IRS/ Diminishing average cost over a broad range of output
    - $\rightarrow$ 'a natural monopoly'
    - (Here multiple firms producing separately are *less efficient producers*, cannot produce at the lowest cost)

. . .

- Debatable: Special knowledge of a low-cost method of production, or key resource

----

### Legal barriers to entry.

- Patents and copyrights

- Exclusive franchise or license (granted by government, by another firm, by a university)

- Government support for a dominant firm, discouraging/forbidding others

----

... from the 2016 Massachusetts ballot initiative?

## Monopoly profit-maximisation

- As always, set Q to maximize $QP(Q)-C(Q)$


<br> \bigskip

. . .


$\rightarrow$ optimization where $MR(Q) = MC(Q)$ (assuming $P>AC$)


. . .

<br> \bigskip

- Remember, the 'volume' benefit of increasing Q is countered by
    - Greater cost (producing more always costs more)
    - The need to reduce price (on all units) to get people to buy it

----

<aside class="notes">Rem: Firm's revenue is Price*Quantity.

Rectangle for a specific point on demand curve.

Firm' *profit* is this less average cost.

MR tells you how the 'revenue rectangle' will increase (or decrease) with another unit.

MC tells you the *cost* of this additional unit.
Where MR>MC, increasing quantity a little bit increases revenue more than costs, thus increasing profit.

```

<aside class="notes">Again, remember that revenue is $P^*Q^*$ but costs at $Q^*$ are $Q^* \times AC$

 so profit is $(P^*-AC)Q^*$.

## Skip: 'no supply curve for a monopoly'




## The deadweight loss of monopoly


*Criticisms of monopoly:*

1. Monopolies produce too little output: allocatively (top-level) inefficient.

- Less output, higher price than under perfect competition


. . .


- Some of the consumer surplus under perfect competition is transferred to the monopolist.

- There is also a *deadweight loss* under monopoly

2. Redistribution from consumers to owners?

<aside class="notes">There is a redistribution of wealth from consumers to owners.

 But this could be counterbalanced by government redistribution</aside>

### Second lecture/material on monopolies: goals



- What is 'price discrimination'?


. . .



<br> \bigskip

- What forms can price discrimination take, and how does it increase a monopoly's profits?

. . .


<br> \bigskip

-  How does price discrimination affect social welfare, and whom does it help or hurt?



<br> \bigskip


- `r format_with_col("Very briefly: other forms of imperfect competition","gray")`


<aside class="notes">You should care because this is both an important business practice,

increasingly relevant and interesting with online tracking/big data

it affects you as a consumer, and it's an important policy issue</aside>

## Price discrimination

Price Discrimination

:      The practice of firms offering different prices to different consumers for the same product,




. . .


<br> \bigskip

- or different prices for slightly different *products* or quantities,
    - where the price difference *doesn't* merely reflect a production cost difference,
    - aiming to distinguish consumers' *willingness to pay* (WTP).

<aside class="notes">This includes 'volume discounts', or offering an 'all you can eat' plan alongside a per-unit plan;

 it may also include time-of-day pricing and couponing.</aside>

----

### Why do firms price discriminate?


. . .



- To increase profit
    - by 'extracting more surplus' from consumers



. . .


<br> \bigskip

**In general...**


for a monopoly firm, the ability to identify consumers based on their WTP and charge distinct prices *will* increase profit.


. . .


<br> \bigskip


... but it may increase or decrease *social* (consumer+producer) surplus

<br> \bigskip

Consumer surplus itself may increase or decrease.


----

### The alternative to price discrimination (previous analysis)

'Uniform pricing': Offering a single price for a good for all consumers.

- This does not deal with differences amongst consumers.
- 'Forces you' to target a particular group (e.g., the wealthy) reducing total sales.
- Under monopoly, this leads to a deadweight loss


. . .

```

----

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='4.5in', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("ppd2.png")
```

----

Price discrimination may seem counter-intuitive: 'how can offering some consumers lower prices increase profit?'



. . .


<br> \bigskip

Higher prices $\rightarrow$ greater profit per unit; but also higher price $\rightarrow$ sell fewer units.

The more you charge the less you sell.


. . .


<br> \bigskip

- Groups of 'less keen' consumers are very sensitive to price; would buy little at high price $\rightarrow$ lower price more profitable here.

- Identifiable 'keen' consumers buy a lot even at a high price. 'Less price-sensitive':  higher price more profitable here.


----

### The three types of price discrimination

1. Individual-based (First degree; at best 'perfect')

\


<aside class="notes">Targeting a price at each consumer; may be done on the internet or on a discretionary basis by an individual seller.

 'Perfect' means the seller exactly predicts and charges each consumer her valuation.</aside>


. . .


2. Self-selection (Second degree)

\



<aside class="notes">2dpd: Here the firm doesn't know each consumer's valuations,

or is not allowed to 'discriminate' by charging different prices to different people

Instead, it sells different bundles, quantities,

  or qualities of products to get high and low-value consumers to separate themselves

 E.g., first-class seats.</aside>



. . .


3. Group-based (Third degree; 'market separation')


<aside class="notes">3dpd: Here the firm finds something identifiable and inherent about the consumer

 that is indicative of her likely valuations (and price-sensitivity).

It might be her age, nationality, student-status, or even perhaps her income.</aside>


----

### First-degree and/or 'perfect' price discrimination

The firm can offer each individual a different price for each unit they purchase.


. . .


<br> \bigskip


Assuming you know what the consumer is willing to pay, you can make the *highest possible profit*; that is called 'perfect' price discrimination.


----

Perfect price discrimination
:     Charging each consumer (for each unit) the *maximum* he/she would be willing to pay, i.e., her valuation


. . .


- Here, monopolist extracts *all available surplus*; no consumer surplus remains


. . .


<br> \bigskip

- Because monopolists extract *all* the possible surplus, this is efficient
    - Because max(total value of good - cost) $\rightarrow$ max(CS+PS)

----

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("mindreadcustomers.jpg")
```

----


<br> \bigskip

- Perfect PD is a rare/impossible extreme: requires mind reading
    - Close example: Website targets individualised price to each consumer, using clues like time-of-day, web clicks, cookie data, IP location.


<br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("Is this 'perfect' PD?","blue")`

<br> \bigskip


. . .


- No, it isn't (see note).

<aside class="notes">Web cookies etc: Here, the seller does not really know exactly what the consumer is willing to pay; he is using broad clues.

 Also, the ability to 'browse incognito' severely limits this </aside>


<aside class="notes">See Shiller, B. R. (2013, or updated version). First degree price discrimination using big data.</aside>

```


----

### Second-degree price discrimination (self-selection)

- Firm is unable to differentiate between consumers, uses quality/quantity so consumers self-select.
    - Quality- Transport- Different classes, Supermarkets- budget products
    - Quantity- Supermarkets- Larger quantities at lower prices per unit; i.e., 'nonlinear pricing'


. . .

\


- 8 oz coffee for \pounds1.60 vs. 16 oz. for \pounds2.00
- 20 p per oz vs. 12.5p per oz.
- (with linear pricing there would be the same price of 15p/oz.)
    - Result: with 2 prices monopoly can get 'high value' consumers to buy/get more in total without losing 'low-value' consumers


----

- Similar with quality: Don't know who high-valuation flyers are (wtp for travel *itself* varies)

. . .


<br> \bigskip

- But may know on *average* that flyers with higher wtp for travel *also* value comfort more
    - Make second-class seats very uncomfortable, first-class luxurious, and charge more for first-class seats
    - Can get consumers with higher values for travel *and* comfort to pay more
    - without losing lower-valuing customers


<aside class="notes">I am not going to cover the algebra nor graphical analysis of second-degree PD, nonlinear pricing, or two-part pricing</aside>

----

### The 'self-selection' problem

Train companies must price first and second class such that consumers will self-select.

- If first class is too expensive then the high valuing group will not choose first class


. . .

<br> \bigskip

- If second-class is too cheap, both the high and low groups will choose second class


. . .


<br> \bigskip

- But if second class is too expensive, the low groups will not buy a ticket.

### Third-degree price discrimination (3dpd)/ Group based/ Market separation

Third-degree (group-based) price discrimination
:    The practice of charging different prices to different groups that can be identified by the seller

. . .


\medskip


- The firm can differentiate *groups of consumers* or 'local markets', not individuals.
- Each group has a different willingness to pay *on average*
    -  $\rightarrow$ Offer lower prices to lower-valuing groups, higher prices to higher-valuing groups

. . .


\medskip

- Example: Students face lower prices for transport, food and other goods as they have a lower willingness to pay
    - Remember: this is *not* done out of charity but to boost profits

----

### Pricing under 3dpd/market separation

- Each group or market has it's own demand $\rightarrow$ marginal revenue curve
    - So set an optimising price quantity *separately* for each group
    - E.g., a discount for the elderly, higher price for the middle-aged
    - Or a lower price in Portugal than in Germany

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

```

 knitr::include_graphics("Price-discrimination-SNP2.png")
```

----


### Who benefits from 3DPD?

- Consumers *in identifiable group* with lower wtp face lower prices, thus they benefit


. . .


- Consumers *in identifiable group* with higher wtp face higher prices, thus they lose


. . .

<br> \bigskip


- Firms can charge higher prices to high-wtp group without losing low-wtp group $\rightarrow$ increase profit


. . .


Net welfare result: theoretically uncertain


----

For consumers:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pdwelfare.png")
```

----

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='4.5in', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pdwelfareoverall.png")
```


----


### Why uncertain?

- When groups can be identified as 'low and high valuation'

    - high-valuation groups get charged more, thus consume less

    - low-valuation groups charged less, thus consume more


. . .



- $\rightarrow$ Who eats it?:  *Given what is produced*, PD causes it to be consumed by people who value it relatively less!


<br> \bigskip

*This is bad, it reduces "exchange efficiency" but...*


----



- Production: On the other hand PD can lead more to be produced/consumed

<br> \bigskip


. . .


- E.g., if with a 'uniform price' only the wealthy went to a restaurant...
    - after PD (early-bird discounts, OAP discounts, benefits discounts) the low-income may also dine in the restaurant
    - $\rightarrow$ more value is produced

<aside class="notes">Here it comes closer to perfect PD</aside>

----


- Two effects trade off: negative 'exchange efficiency' impact, potentially positive impact on production

...of the otherwise underproduced good (rem DWL of monopoly) $\rightarrow$ top-level efficiency may increase (or decrease)


. . .


- Because of the negative 'exchange efficiency effect', \underline{quantity produced} (and consumed) \underline{must increase} after PD for it to outweigh this and be beneficial in net



<br> \bigskip

Quantity increase is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.

----


### But 'arbitrage' can foil price discrimination


. . .


- If, e.g., elderly who get discounts could sell products to middle-aged...
    - Middle-aged would ask them to do this, never pay high price
    - Firm could no longer profit from this
    - Similar issues with quantity discounts, or 'web cookie' personalised pricing


. . .


- So PD only 'works' for hard-to-trade goods like haircuts
    - Or where purchases are frequent & low-value, resale markets difficult

<aside class="notes">The above issues are sometimes referred to as 'transactions costs'</aside>


----

### David's idea: A new policy tool

- People with low-incomes tend to have lower-wtp for most goods
- Government can typically identify and verify incomes


. . .


- Governments could allow and encourage low-income consumers to get an ID indicating this
- Governments could allow and encourage firms to use this for price-discrimination


. . .

\


- Firms would increase profit
- Low-income households would benefit, reducing inequality

<br> \bigskip


. . .


- Net impact on efficiency uncertain; worth investigating


## Natural monopolies and regulation (very brief or skip)

- Where an industry involves a 'natural monopoly' (IRS) the most efficient production is a unified production process . . .
    - But if a monopoly reigns it overcharges and underprovides

. . .

<br> \bigskip

$\rightarrow$  Government may want to allow/enforce monopoly privileges but *regulate* price it can charge


- Difficulty: Government wants to regulate $p=AC$, but it doesn't know firms' actual cost function (asymmetric information)
    - Firm wants government to think it is high cost

<aside class="notes">This yields another mechanism design 'hidden information' 'principal-agent problem'</aside>

[comment]: <> (pre2018BB)

## Problem set

*See especially tutorial 5, 'Fifth problem set: Monopolies and price discrimination'*


<br> \bigskip



Two questions involving solving for monopoly quantity, etc., discussing the result.

This is likely to be relevant to the final.






Also relevant:

- N& S Review question 6: Figure 11.3 illustrates the 'deadweight loss' from the monopolization of a market. What is this a loss of?


- Suppose a monopolist had identical costs in two distinct markets; when (under what conditions) why will it charge should charge a higher price in one market than in the other market? (And in which market will it charge a higher price)?




[comment]: <> (pre2018EE)

#(We may skip): IMPERFECT COMPETITION

## Brief notes on imperfect competition


With multiple firms in the same market but not complete 'free entry', theory predicts a range of possible outcomes.

1. collusion: 'patient' firms may collude to establish monopoly price, or any price above competitive price

\


<aside class="notes">recall the indefinitely-repeated prisoner's dillemma here</aside>



. . .

2. 'Cournot' competition, firms choose quantities: predicts intermediate price, between competitive & monopoly prices


<aside class="notes">Some cool Cournot results like markups equal the inverse elasticity of demand divided by the number of firms</aside>

<aside class="notes">the related 'Stackleberg' model lets one firm choose first -- it will have a 'first-mover advantage' but still prices are intermediate</aside>

\


. . .


3. 'Bertrand' competition in prices: predicts firms compete price down to the competitive (mc) level

\


. . .


4. Product differentiation, monopolistic competition: may lead to zero long-run profits, with $p=AC>MC>$ for each firm.


<aside class="notes">When firms can differentiate their products from one another this may reduce competition.

 each firm acts as a 'local' monopoly over it's own unique product. with free entry, however, firms introduce new products which shift the demand curves inwards for the other products (substitutes), until no firm is making long run profits.</aside>
