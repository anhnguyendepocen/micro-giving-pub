# Market failure (One case: Public goods) (L8)

Given what we have learned, (how) will the market provide the goods in this picture? </center>

## Market failures - public goods, coverage

- NS: Ch 16 -- public goods section only <small> (skip Lindahl equiliibrium, median voter, single-peaked preferences optional) </small>

*Goals of this introduction*

-  How do economists define a public good? What fits into this category?

-  Better understand 'market failures'



## Market failures

... Occur when prices don't fully reflect the marginal social benefits or costs

- May provide scope for political intervention

- How does this happen?


. . .


- One potential source of market failure: Public Goods

## Public Goods (attributes, categories)

What are the characteristics of a public good?


----

*Def* -- A **Pure Public Good** is a good that is both


. . .


1. *Non-excludable*: Once the good is provided, it is impossible/costly to prevent any individual from using/benefiting from it.

<aside class="notes">Even individuals who have not paid for it</aside>

<aside class="notes">Opposite: Exclusive goods*: ... if it is relatively easy to bar people from benefitting from it once it has been produced</aside>



. . .

2. *Non-rival:* One person's consumption doesn't reduce the quantity available for others.



. . .


- The fact that some people use the good doesn't prevent others from using the *same* good.

- There is no 'crowding.'

- Provision/consumption to additional users at zero marginal (social) cost.


<aside class="notes">Q: think of some examples.</aside>

<aside class="notes">
<small> In market economies, private suppliers provide the majority of goods and services to consumers. However, certain goods are publicly provided. These include for example defense, education, and health. Why does the government instead of the market provide these goods?  Which characteristics differentiate goods that are privately provided from goods that are publicly provided? How do we define public goods? The terminology might induce the conclusion that '----public goods are good that are publicly provided as opposed to private goods which are privately provided.' This conclusion is simply WRONG! The public or private nature of the good is an intrinsic characteristic of goods that is not related to the provider of the good
Hence, it may well be that the state provides a private good or that
the market provides a public good. </small> </aside>

Excludable and rival (depleatable)? $\rightarrow$ *Private good*

. . .

\

*'Club goods':* excludable but non-rivalrous (at least up to a congestion point).

. . .

*"Common property"*: Nonexcludable but rivalrous

**What about?**

- Recorded music
- 'Information' goods (e.g., software)
- A national park
- A theatre performance
- Roads
- Clean air
- Education
- Aid to the needy

**What about?**

- Loud music coming from my window
- Disease control
- Economic research
- The justice system
- Fireworks in Disney World
- The 2012 Olympics in London

**The basic ideas**

If a good is *non-rival* then additional provision (of the units produced, to more consumers) is costless.

. . .

Thus,

- if exclusion is possible, and *any* positive price is charged, some are deterred from consuming it


<!-- \pause -->


- this is inefficient: people who could benefit from the good, at no cost to others, will not consume it :(


And...

----

(If non-rival)

Even if each person provided it for their *own* benefit (on the assumption that no one else would), they would typically choose *too little* from a social POV...


<br> \bigskip

Considering their own marginal benefits (and MRS) versus the price or cost, not the *social* marginal benefit (an 'externality' to them)



----

If a good is *non-excludable* it will be difficult to charge people for it

- many will prefer to wait for *others* to buy it, and then they enjoy it anyways (free-ride) `r format_with_col("(that's a 'coordination problem')","gray")`

. . .

But if firms cannot charge for its full value, they might not pay the fixed costs to develop/build/provide it

. . .

Who would pay to produce a film that is freely pirated/distributed?
Who would pay to develop a drug that must be priced at its marginal cost?
Why contribute to police protection for your village, if your neighbours will pay for it anyways?

<aside class="notes">Loosely, 'rivalryness' basically relates to whether market provision will be *efficient*,

 while 'excludability' tells you whether firms can make *significant amounts of revenue* from providing it, selling (access to) the same produced good to more than one person</aside>

### Motivation

**Policy:** 'Public goods argument' - justifies many government programmes (military, environmental cleanup, research, etc)


<br> \bigskip


. . .


**Management:** Companies/individuals can only profit (or even cover costs) from providing a public good through `r format_with_col("???","blue")`
