#  Utility and Choice

(Largely from NS Chapter 2)


# Motivation

Consider a decision you recently made?

<br> <br> \bigskip

- Define this decision clearly.

- How do you think you decided among these options?


. . .

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

<aside class="notes">What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the same decision?

If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same situation again. Do you think you'd make the same decision?</aside>

----

Suppose I asked you

'State a rule that governs (determines/characterizes) how people *do* make decisions'...

. . .

<br> <br> \bigskip

I want this rule to be...

1. Informative (it rules *out* at least some sets of choices)

2. Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule)

----

Similar question:

'State a rule that governs how people *should* make decisions'..

 <br> <br> \bigskip

By 'should' I mean that *they will not regret having made decisions in this way.*

<!-- <!-- \pause --> -->

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

----

\Huge If people *did* follow these rules, what would this imply and predict? \normalsize

<!-- <!-- \pause --> -->

Rules defined as 'axioms about preferences'





'Standard axioms'  $\rightarrow$ (imply that) choices can be expressed by 'individuals maximising *utility functions* subject to their *budget constraints*'


$\rightarrow$ yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc.

<aside class="notes">Economists and decision theorists have tried to come up with and defend such rules.

 They have started from these 'reasonable axioms' and follow their logical implications for

individual choices, individual responses to changes in prices and income,

market prices and quantities and their responses,

`welfare' and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc.</aside>

- Depict and interpret optimisation with indifference curves and budget constraints

<aside class="notes">Warn that this is somewhat abstract but it will make sense

 Part 2 (ch 2-3) involves building the demand curve from first principles,

<aside class="notes">
- Want to develop a model that can be used to show how we make choices or decisions.

-Your choices are determined by two things:

-Preferences: what goods do you like

# Utility

Utility
:     "The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity."

. . .

<br> <br> \bigskip

:     Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions

<aside class="notes">Adv: There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv: A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated,

  thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, 'utility', which is maximised</aside>

----

*How is this used?*

<br> <br> \bigskip

. . .


Utility will be expressed as a single number that arises from the combination of all goods and services consumed.

. . .


<br> <br> \bigskip


Essentially, economists assume that `when making a choice among all available and feasible options, an individual will choose the one that yields the greatest *utility*'


## Utility from two goods

$$Utility = U(X,Y; other)$$


\


. . .


- Leisure and 'goods consumption'
- Food and non-food
- Coffee and tea (holding all else constant)





----

$$Utility = U(X,Y)$$

<br> <br> \bigskip

 `r format_with_col("Maths revision","blue")`: $U(X,Y)$ expresses a *function* with two *arguments*, X and Y.

- $U(X,Y)$ must take *some* value for every positive value of X and Y.

<aside class="notes">In  *general* a function of X and Y might increase or decrease in either X or Y,

 or increase over some ranges and decrease over other ranges of these two arguments.</aside>

<aside class="notes">Consider the function `altitude of land in Britain as a function of degrees longitude and latitude'</aside>

. . .

This expresses a *general* function; I haven't specified *what* this function is

- E.g., it could be $U(X,Y)=\sqrt(XY)$

<aside class="notes">We can consider functions in general having certain properties without specifying exactly what these functions are.</aside>



## Measuring and comparing utilities

<aside class="notes">Adv: This is a difficult but well-studied issue, as it is important for methodology and welfare analysis.


 In more detailed discussions, we might speak of 'cardinal utility', 'ordinal utility', etc.,

 to indicate ways we can compare utility between individuals and in response to policy changes.</aside>

Utility is not 'observable and measurable in utils'

<!-- <!-- \pause --> -->

(Unlike midi-chlorians or thetans)


<br> <br> \bigskip

<!-- <!-- \pause --> -->

Utility is seen to govern an individual's *choices* and thus it's only inferred indirectly, from the *choices* people make

----

**Revealed preference:** if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a dog was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat

<aside class="notes">As we only get at utility through an *individual's* decisions, we have no reliable way to compare it across individuals</aside>




# Standard assumptions about preferences ('axioms')



1. Completeness

<aside class="notes">Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive.</aside>

<aside class="notes">The more formal and parsimonious definition (Autor readings, Jehle/Reny) develop this from a single relation 'weakly preferred to'.</aside>

2. Transitivity (internal consistency)

<aside class="notes">If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.</aside>


3. More is Better (*nonsatiation*)


<aside class="notes">Completeness and transitivity (and continuity)  are necessary for people's choices to be represented by (continuous) *utility functions*

Continuity is necessary for 'well behaved' (not-jumpy) demand curves

(Local) Nonsatiation will help us derive results</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv: this 'preference for variety' is thought to hold for most combinations of goods, most of the time, but perhaps not for all pairings.

It tends to lead to easy-to-solve 'interior solutions' where people may consume some amount of each good, and have smooth reactions to price changes.

Extreme of this is 'necessity' goods. </aside>

thus, the less I need to sacrifice of $Y$ to get another unit of $X$.

If I spend all my income `r format_with_col("(I will do over a 'relevant lifetime')","gray")`:

\

. . .



Expenditure on X + Expenditure on Y = Income (I)


$$P_X X + P_Y Y = I $$


. . .



To see how $Y$ trades off against $X$, rearrange this to:


. . .



$$Y = -\frac{P_X}{P_Y} X + \frac{I}{P_Y}$$


. . .


> - Intercept $\frac{I}{P_Y}$: amount of Y you can buy if you only buy Y
> - Slope $-\frac{P_X}{P_Y}$: how much Y you must give up to get another X

what they mean, and have intuition for why the slope has this formula. See 'micro quiz 2.3'.</aside>

### More insight (mathy: ignore if this freaks you out)



Recall $U=U(X,Y)$.

$$U_X(X,Y) := MU_X(X,Y)$$

\medskip


. . .


*Derivative w/ respect to X: rate utility increases if we add a little X, holding Y constant*

... Similarly for $MU_Y$.


. . .

\



MRS: 'how much Y would I be willing to give up to get a unit of X'?

. . .
\

Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each ... we can show $MRS(X,Y)=\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}$

<aside class="notes">Intuition: the more valuable a little more X is to me  -- the higher is MU_X --

  the more Y I am willing to give up to get it. That is why MU_X is in the numerator</aside>

<aside class="notes">See derivation in handout if interested</aside>


----


Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields more intuition:

$$P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y$$



(at each consumption point X,Y)


. . .

\medskip

\

$$\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$$


. . .


\

$\leftrightarrow$ Same 'bang for each buck' (`r format_with_col("if","red")` optimising)

<aside class="notes">If this didn't hold true and you were spending on both goods,

you would be paying 'more per util' for one good than the other,

and thus should reallocate to that other good.</aside>


<aside class="notes">The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point

 -- the higher is MU_x -- the more Y I'm willing to give up to get it.

```

----

If you are consuming both goods and optimising, $P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y$ must hold

\

. . .


But you might consume *none* of some good (say X)

\

. . .

-  if even with *no* X, $MU_X/P_X<MU_Y/P_Y$, the marginal utility of the first unit 'per £' is lower.

# Algebraic/numerical examples

----

Consider: are these 'perfect substitutes' for someone who wants caffeine, but has no taste buds?


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/amount-of-caffeine-in-drinks.jpg")
```

----

### Perfect substitutes, but not identical, e.g.,

<aside class="notes">This may be confusing.

By 'perfect substitutes' we mean pairs of goods for which *some amount* of one is always valued the same as *some amount* of the other,

  and this proportion is always the same.

An easy example:  I might always be indifferent between three pints of mild ale and two pints of strong ale,

 if they have the same total alcohol content and I only want to get tipsy.</aside>

$$U(X,Y)=4X+3Y$$


. . .

Rates each increase utility per-unit (derivative) are constant: $MU_X = 4$, $MU_Y = 3$


. . .


So (for perfect substitutes) buy the one that increases it more *per-£*

----

**With perfect substitutes: 'Bang for the buck' rule**

$$U(X,Y)=4X+3Y$$

<br> <br> \bigskip

. . .

- Compare $MU_X/P_X$ to $MU_Y/P_Y$

. . .

- Here, if $4/P_X > 3/P_Y$, then buy X

- if $4/P_X < 3/P_Y$, then buy Y;  `r format_with_col("(if equal, buy either)","gray")`

. . .


- Rearranging, if $P_X < 4/3 P_Y$, buy X ... etc.

<!-- <!-- \pause --> -->
`r format_with_col("Warning:","red")` If *not* perfect substitutes, MU ratios depend on consumption levels.

----

### Perfect complements

<aside class="notes">AKA 'Leontief preferences'</aside>
<aside class="notes">Lecture question: come up with an example</aside>

Mathematical function example:
\

$$U(X,Y)=min(2X,Y)$$

`r format_with_col("E.g., X: bicycle frames, Y: wheels.","gray")`


. . .


<small> <center> `r format_with_col("Warning:","red")` this min function looks backwards, but it's correct; see notes </small> </center>


. . .

Shortcut: figure out the proportions it will be consumed in

. . .

- determine cost of '1 bundle of the combo' at given prices

. . .

- ... then buy as many such bundles as you can afford

<aside class="notes">"Min" function just takes the smaller of the arguments

to max this (not waste money), set the arguments to 'min' equal, here 2X=Y</aside>

<aside class="notes">You should be able to do this without having taken economics.

 Suppose you were given \pounds100 and asked to spend it to make as many sausages-with-baps as possible.

 No one can eat a sausage without a bap, nor vice-versa.
   Sausages come in packs of 4, and baps come in packs of 8. How many packs of each will you buy,

  Supposing both types of packs cost \pounds1 each?</aside>

### Middle-ground (\*)

A Cobb-Douglas example

$$ U(X,Y)=\sqrt(XY) $$



<aside class="notes">LC: We are 'allowed' to square the whole thing to simplify the problem. Why?</aside>


. . .


$$MU_X = \frac{\partial}{\partial X} (XY)^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} (Y/X)^{1/2}$$


. . .


$$MU_Y =  \frac{1}{2} (X/Y)^{1/2}$$


<aside class="notes">General Cobb-Douglas: $U(X,Y)=X^a Y^b$ for a, b positive constants</aside>

<aside class="notes">\* If time is short, we may cover this in the class/tutorial instead)</aside>

<br> <br> \bigskip


*Here, amount of Y you'd give up to get a unit of X:*

$$MRS(X,Y)= MU_X/MU_Y = Y/X$$

<aside class="notes">MU_X is the slope of U(X,Y) in X at a particular point, i.e., the (partial) derivative with respect to X</aside>



<aside class="notes">The last equality comes from this *particular* function; it is not always Y/X.</aside>


. . .


\

<small> Check it's reasonable: The more Y I've, the more Y I'd give up to get another X :) </small>



<aside class="notes">This slope is derived through calculus.</aside>
<aside class="notes">Adv, maths:

MU_X is the slope of U(X,Y) in X at a particular point, i.e., the (partial) derivative with respect to X

$MU_X = \frac{\partial</aside>{\partial X} (XY)^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} (XY)^{-1/2}Y = \frac{1}{2} (Y/X)^{1/2}$

Similarly, $MU_Y =  \frac{1}{2} (X/Y)^{1/2}$.

</aside>

<!---
<aside class="notes">Adv: In doing theoretical (i.e., more pure mathematical) work,

economists typically like to find results under as general 'weak' conditions as possible,

making the fewest possible assumptions or restrictions.

Still, it can be helpful to use particular functional forms, both for estimation using data,

and for illustrating theoretical insights.

However, it is actually rather difficult to find simple functions that are easy to work with and have nice 'reasonable' properties.</aside>

*...Cobb-Douglas ctd*

$$MRS(X,Y)= MU_X/MU_Y = Y/X$$

. . .

\

Here utility-maximization requires, at optimal choices of X and Y:
$$MRS(X,Y)= Y/X = P_X/P_Y$$

<aside class="notes">Check it makes sense.

 As P_X increases the right-hand-side (RHS) increases,

  and so to increase the LHS I must increase the units of Y consumed,

  and thus decrease the units of X consumed</aside>

<aside class="notes">I say 'here' because we now have nice convex indifference curves with 'normal' slopes,

unlike for perfect complements or substitutes.

The more of one good you have the less you value it relative to the other good (unlike perfect substitutes)

but you still value more of it somewhat (unlike for perfect complements)</aside>

. . .

<small> For any price ratio, find ratio of Y & X. With prices and income, $I$, find consumption of X \& Y. </small>

. . .

Rearranging optimization condition:

$$Y P_Y = X P_X$$

<aside class="notes">Class question-  What is weird about this?
Ans: You always spend the same *amount* on each good, no matter the price

 (Note, that doesn't mean the same number of units)

 This 'constant expenditure shares' are a characteristic of Cobb-Douglas functions that limit their usefulness and realism</aside>

----

So optimization condition for `r format_with_col("this particular","red")` utility function:

$$Y P_Y = X P_X$$


. . .

\
Combining this with the budget constraint
$$P_X X + P_Y Y = I$$

solve for X & Y, as fncns of prices \& income (see notes) $\rightarrow$

. . .


\
\medskip

$$Y = I/(2P_Y)$$
$$X = I/(2P_X)$$

<aside class="notes">Rearranging the optimization condition, $Y = X P_X/P_Y$.
 \
From the b.c., $X = (I - P_Y Y)/P_X$.
 \
Substituting in for $Y$ yields $X = (I - P_Y(X P_X / P_Y))/P_X = I/P_X - X$
 \
$\rightarrow 2X = I/P_X \rightarrow X = I/(2P_X)$
 \
$X P_X = I / 2 \rightarrow$ always spend half your income on X.
 \
Adv: You can solve for the optimal $Y$ by 'symmetry': as utility
 \
and budget constraint are symmetric everything we said holds replacing X with Y.

- 2.3 Paul derives utility only from CDs and DVDs. His utility function is
    $$U=\sqrt(CD)$$
    - Parts a-c (*Note,there is a video solution to this on the Cengage web site*   )
    - a. Sketch Paul's indifference curves for U=5, U=10, and U=20
    - b. Suppose Paul has \$200 to spend and that CDs cost \$5 and DVDs cost \$20. Draw Paul's budget constraint on the same graph as his indifference curves.
    - c. Suppose Paul spends all of his income on DVDs. How many can he buy and what is his utility?
    - We extend this problem: Continuing this, note $MRS=MU_C/MU_D$ in general, and for this case:
        $$MRS=MU_C/MU_D=\frac{D\frac{1}{2}(CD)^{-1/2}]}{C\frac{1}{2}(CD)^{-1/2}}=D/C$$
    - I. With this information, determine how many CDs and DVD's Paul will buy, and what his utility will be.
    - II. Explain intuitively, graphically, and mathematically, why we know this allocation will maximise his utility.
