# Key goals


## Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study)

How do you derive an *individual's* demand curve from her utility function?

- What causes shifts in either?

. . .

\

What properties do demand curves have?

----

Understand the following concepts/outcomes (& how to derive them):

> Substitution and income effects (of a price change)

> Goods that are 'substitutes' or 'complements' (WARNING!)

. . .


> Consumer surplus (from a transaction)

> The lump-sum principle (and the distortion of taxation)


<aside class="notes">remember, this is not the same as 'perfect substitutes/complements' </aside>

----

- What is a *market* demand curve, and how do we derive it?


. . .

- Understand the concepts:

    - Price elasticity (of market demand for a product), and what it means to firms' pricing strategy

    - Income elasticity (...)

    - Cross-price elasticity (between two products)

. . .

\

- Be able to discuss real world examples and applications of the above


----

*[Second part](recap)*


**Understand real-world issues:**

1. A 'Fixed-basket' consumer price index (CPI) may overstate inflation

2. The lump-sum principle,  the distortion of taxation

\


**Fundamental concepts, useful for business & policy:**

1. Goods may be 'substitutes' or 'complements' for one another (not the same as 'perfect' substitutes/complements!)

2. How can we consider/compute the  *Consumer surplus* from a transaction?





# Demand functions

## Demand functions

- Previous: consumption choices determined by utility functions/indifference curves and budget constraints

. . .

$$Quantity \: of \: X \: demanded = d_x(P_X, P_Y, I; preferences)$$


<aside class="notes">LC: Write this on the board</aside>



## Homogeneity

Homogeneous (of degree zero) (demand) function
:      A function whose outcome value does not change when all arguments are changed proportionally


. . .


<br> \bigskip

$d_X(P_X,P_Y,I)$ is homogenous in its arguments


<br> \bigskip

- Multiply all prices and income by same amount $\rightarrow$ budget constraint unchanged $\rightarrow$ consumption choices the same


. . .

E.g., $P_X X + P_Y Y = I$ is the same as $2P_X X + 2P_Y Y = 2I$


<aside class="notes">Intuition: Graphically, the budget line and indifference curves are unchanged, so the point of tangency is the same.

 Consider, if your income, as well as prices, were stated in pennies rather than pounds (e.g., 5 million pennies rather than \pounds50,000), why would your choices change?</aside>

<aside class="notes">This relates to the puzzle of 'why should monetary policy and inflation have any real effect?'</aside>

----

## Response to income changes


$$d_x(P_X, P_Y, \mathbf{I}; preferences)$$

<br> \bigskip


- What happens to the quantity purchased of some good as your income increases?

<aside class="notes">LC: Ask this as class question</aside>


. . .


- Depends on whether the good is *normal* or *inferior*

<br> \bigskip

<aside class="notes">Whether it is normal or inferior depends on your preferences and the change in the slope of the indifference curves with higher income/utility, as we see below</aside>


---

$$d_x(P_X, P_Y, \mathbf{I}; preferences)$$

Normal good
:     A good that is bought in greater quantities as income increases.

Inferior good
:     A good that is bought in smaller quantities as income increases.

<aside class="notes">Two things going on here:

1. A wider set of consumption possibilities ... can afford more of X for any Y and v/v

<aside class="notes">More income, less expenditure on Z?

It's bc the shape of indifference curves differs at higher incomes here; shallower.

When people have a lot to spend, they want to spend it on Y and not on Z.

Substitution effect ('Hicksian')
:     The effect on consumption due to a change in price 'holding utility constant.'

`r format_with_col("Precisely: effect on the lowest-cost bundle yielding this utility","gray")`



. . .


Income effect (of a price change)
:     The remaining effect on consumption; price change $\rightarrow$ change in purchasing power/achievable utility.

<aside class="notes">This is conceptual: we never *actually* observe either of these effects alone;

 we always observe the net effect of both</aside>

<aside class="notes">Standard definition of the 'income effect' of a price change

combines both 'effects of an income change' we saw above

more consumption of each good is possible, but the MRS may differ at this higher utility</aside>

```{r  fig.cap = 'income and substitution effects', out.height='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/incomeandsubstfx.png")
```

<small> (ppt here... "Change in a good's price") </small>

<aside class="notes">Move to PPT slides to illustrate this,

 beginning with 'Change in A Good's Price'</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv: This topic is more nuanced and complicated than we will cover in the main content of this module.

To fully cover this, we would have to consider the theoretical concept of a 'compensated' aka 'Hicksian' demand curve,

where income is adjusted to hold utility constant while price ratios change.

This also allows us to consider 'net versus gross' substitution, and 'equivalent vs compensating variation'.

More advanced economics modules will cover this extensively and rigorously.</aside>

----

- Substitution effect: `r format_with_col("ALWAYS","blue")` opposite direction as price change

. . .

- Income effect
    - Normal good $\rightarrow$ `r format_with_col("Opposite direction as price change","blue")`
    - Inferior good: `r format_with_col("Same direction as price change","brown")`
. . .

<br> \bigskip
Thus

- Normal good: Substitution & income effects go in *same direction*

. . .

- Inferior good: Substitution & income effects go in opposite directions
    - $\rightarrow$ *Net* effect unknown
    - Usually substitution effect dominates `r format_with_col("but see Giffen goods","gray")`

----

**Read on your own, know:**

- Numerical example of response to price change
- The relative importance of substitution effects for most goods
- Substitution and income effects for inferior goods

## Different substitution effects

- Perfect complements: No substitution effect, only an income effect of a price change

- Perfect substitutes: Large substitution effect -- price change may cause a complete switch

- In between: depends on curvature of indifference curve

## Shifts in an individual's demand curve

What might cause an individual's demand curve for a product to shift (inward or outward)?


. . .



- *Not* 'a change in the price of that good'.
- *Not* a shift in the supply curve.


. . .


Yes:

- Change in price of complements or substitutes for that good
- Change in income
- Maybe: $\Delta$ consumer's info, preferences, weather, etc.

## Shifts in the Market Demand Curve

Similar things that cause individual demand curve shifts:

. . .

- Increases in overall income (for normal goods)

. . .

- Reduced prices of complements, increased price of substitutes



<aside class="notes">You can only express the demand curve as a function of aggregate income under restrictive assumptions.

  In general, it depends *who* gets this income. (See 'aggregation issues').</aside>

. . .


- i.e., the 'elasticity' of orange sales wrt price is about 2 . . .

    - But elasticities need not be constant; they may depend on starting point

    - E.g., linear demand $\rightarrow$ different price elasticity at each point

## Price elasticity of demand

Price elasticity of demand:
$$e_{Q_d,p} = \frac{percent \ change \ in \ Q_d}{percent \ change \ in \ p} $$
$$  = \frac{\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}/\frac{\Delta p}{p}$$

`r format_with_col("(actually, the limit of this as these changes converge to zero)","gray")`

. . .


- Should always be negative (except for Giffen goods)

- A unitless measure related to the slope of the demand curve

- *Very* important for price-setting firms (more on this later)

> The retailer does not expect any impact from the drop in sterling since the Brexit vote to kick in until at least the spring of 2017, as it had hedged some of its foreign-currency exposures in advance. Still, it expects expenses to rise by up to 5 per cent next year.
> `The last time we had to increase prices (which was in 2010 when cotton prices soared) we estimated that price elasticity was around 1.1.'

----

> If that remains the case today, a retail selling price increase of 5% would result in a fall in unit sales of -5.5% and a fall in like for like sales value of between -0.5% to -1.0%. In the scheme of things, we think that this drag on sales is manageable and less damaging than taking a significant hit to margin.'

Properties of price elasticity of demand:

- Goods w/ close substitutes at a close price $\rightarrow$  highly elastic
- ... with few substitutes ...  inelastic
- Typically: elasticity greater in *long run* than short run. `r format_with_col("Why?","blue")`

<aside class="notes">Ans: Over time, consumers can adjust to price changes by changing their consumption patterns.

 E.g., if petrol gets more expensive I can switch to a hybrid or electric car, or a bicycle.</aside>

- Total expenditure (revenue): price $\times$ quantity

. . .

- So percent *change* in total expenditure is:
    - pct change price $\times$ pct *change* quantity

. . .

As $e_{Q,p}$ tells you the pct change quantity for a small pct change in price:

<aside class="notes">Q: A price-setting firm should basically never want to set its price at a point where demand is inelastic. Why not?</aside>

<aside class="notes">Ans: If it were at such a point, it could raise its price and its revenue would increase and costs would decline

 (because it would be selling fewer products but for greater total revenue.)

 A caveat is that it might do this for a long term strategic advantage; e.g., to gain customer loyalty and market share, intending to take its profits later.</aside>

# Income elasticity of demand

## Income elasticity of demand

Income elasticity of demand
:      \% change in quantity demanded of a good in response to 1\% change in income.



$$e_{Q_d,I} = \frac{percent \ change \ in \ Q_d}{percent \ change \ in \  I} $$
$$  = \frac{\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}/\frac{\Delta I}{I}$$
\


. . .

Normal goods: $e_{Q,I} > 0$
\


Inferior goods: $e_{Q,I} < 0$

\


. . .



Luxury goods: $e_{Q,I} > 1$


<aside class="notes">E.g., cocaine is a luxury good, if, when I win /pounds1000 in the lottery, I will increase my consumption of cocaine by *more* than /pounds1000 ...

 (assuming, as in classical models, that I treat all sources of income the same</aside>

<aside class="notes">Q: Is a luxury good a normal good?</aside>
<aside class="notes">Ans: Yes, because $1>0$. However, a normal good may or may not be a luxury good.</aside>
<aside class="notes">Engel's 'law': As income increases, food becomes a smaller share of income.</aside>

<aside class="notes">Q (micro quiz): Why is it that not every good can have an income elasticity of demand greater than 1?

 Can every good have an income elasticity of demand less than 1?</aside>

[Prof. Muellbauer letter to FT](https://www.ft.com/content/4ea79d96-a4d6-11e5-a91e-162b86790c58)o

> Sir, Professor Gordon Gemmill (Letters, December 14), surprisingly for a trained economist, assumes an income elasticity of demand of zero for housing: that is, that people do not demand more and better housing as they become richer. Nowhere in the world is this the case! My own empirical work demonstrates that around two-thirds of the rise in UK house prices, corrected for general inflation, since 1980 is because supply is not keeping up with income and population growth.

----

> Other drivers do exist ... The price effects of extra supply take time to build up. I agree on that. But just imagine what would happen if we did nothing more than we are now doing: population and income growth would drive prices even higher even though we already hold the record for rises in house prices since 1970 among the group of seven leading high-income countries. We need to build far more housing, in the right locations. And we need to start now.
