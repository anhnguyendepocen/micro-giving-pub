1. Separating BEE2038, now BEE2038 and BEEM101
2. Cutting much stuff that is in the web book (formerly 'handout')... just focusing on 'core presentation'
3. Re-tooling to fit the new web book format
4. Make it reveal.js as possible; web host?
5. Possibly split into several files

- Roughly 8 problem sets-- about 1/week on each chunk of material; (unassessed); `r format_with_col("questions come from exams or build exam skills","blue")`

- Support classes/tutorials about each fortnight, covering key material from recent problem sets

- Extensive additional material (formative assesments, mock exams, tutorial videos, forums etc) to help you prepare for asessment, and for your interest

<aside class="notes">these are for your own benefit and not to be turned in.  I will try to make this material both interesting and highly relevant for assessment. The material will come from exams or will focus on building exam skills.</aside>

### What is Economics?

\

\note{DR: It has changed. There are different views.}

> 'Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.'

\

<!-- \pause -->

> 'Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.' Alfred Marshall

<aside class="notes">The first quote suggests an *approach*, the second suggests a *domain*.</aside>
<aside class="notes">'Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.' Ludwig von Mises</aside>
 <aside class="notes">Asked two economists and will probably get at least three answers</aside>

----

### What is Microeconomics?


\


The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets.

<!-- . . . -->


\

<br> \bigskip

> - Largely, using theoretical and mathematical 'models' that depend on strong assumptions.


<aside class="notes">Give some examples of economic choices: Consumer purchases, investments, life and family choices, taking a job,

starting a firm, entering a market, producing a product (type, quality, inputs), pricing it...</aside>

```

<aside class="notes">Are models 'fully realistic'? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications.

 A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and 'general';

 some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed.

 But even these more general models are simplifications</aside>

<!-- . . . -->


Assumptions $\rightarrow$ Results \


<!-- . . . -->

and sometimes $\rightarrow$ testable predictions (if the assumptions hold)

<br> \bigskip

<aside class="notes">Adv: You can critique only the assumptions;

the results are logically/mathematically proven

  although when the results contradict real-world evidence this hints that the assumptions may be substantially wrong.

Do these simplified models yield conclusions that are relevant to the more complicated real world?

Maybe, and sometimes. We will consider the evidence </aside>


----


**So why learn these models?**

- A starting point

- (Sometimes) make testable concrete predictions

- Building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking


<!-- \pause -->

- Discussion is framed around them; seen as a 'baseline'

- Understand to be able to critique/extend


<aside class="notes">Some critics of 'neoliberal economics' can be misinformed about what it is.

<aside class="notes">We will also return to these questions in more depth as we build up the demand and supply curves</aside>

<aside class="notes">LC: Ask students to draw for themselves, then draw standard supply and demand curves on the board here

 to jog their memory.</aside>

*To respect yourself in the morning, know*

- Which factors cause the supply and demand curves to shift?

- What causes 'movements along' the supply or demand curve?



<aside class="notes">Caveat, to avoid later confusion:

These models assume 'price-taking'; neither buyers nor sellers consider the impact of their choices on prices</aside>


#  Do US, EU, & Japanese farm subsidies help or hurt Africans in net?

- See NS APPLICATION 1.4: Economics According to Bono, discussion and references in handout

- Consider the effects on African *farmers* and African *producers*. How could we consider the 'net effect'?

Discussion question 6 from NS

> Gasoline sells for \$4.00 per *gallon* this year, and it sold for \$3.00 per gallon last year.
> But consumers bought more gasoline this year than they did last year. This is clear proof that the economic theory that people buy less when the price rises is incorrect.

> Do you agree? Explain.

**2018 Midterm question  (slightly changed)**

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("ppf_midterm_q_adj.png")
```

<aside class="notes">Solution: a combination of outputs such that no more food could be produced per
week without reducing the production of clothing per week. (However it is not the
âuniqueâ outcome where this is the case, anywhere on the PPF satisfies this)
AND  a combination of outputs that might or might not be socially optimal, depending on preferences.

**2018 Midterm question - again, slightly adjusted**


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("whats_micro_midterm_adj.png")
```

<aside class="notes">
Solution: (A)  Microeconomics is the study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets.

Note that there *may* be only one correct answer

## Next lecture:

- Math tools (some of these, will cover others 'as we go')

- Empirical analysis

- Introduction to Utility and choice (Time-permitting)

<!-- Last year first tutorial did 1.1-1.3, 1.7-1.8

<aside class="notes">Also recommended: Problems 1.5 and 1.9 with video accompaniment, for review</aside>

<!---

#  For next week's tutorial
- The tutors are myself and (TBD)
- Also do the problem posted below

- Also consider 'review questions' 6 and 8 from the NS text

-  will go over the key parts of these problems, and you can ask questions
