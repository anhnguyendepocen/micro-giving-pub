If someone has a decreasing marginal utility of income and they maximise expected utility then they will be risk averse.

This is something that takes a long time to fully explain, and I try to give an explanation in the web-book and in lecture (and again in tomorrow's lecture).



One simple intuition.: Risk averse essentially means "I will never take *any* fair gamble".

E.g., "I'll never accept a bet with an equal chance of losing or gaining some amount X."  How does diminishing MU of income explain this? If I have diminishing MU of income then my utility is increasing in income at a decreasing rate.

The first units of income (e.g., going from 0 income to 15k income) add more utility  than the later units of income (e.g., going from 15k income to 30k income) , which adds more than even later increments (e.g., going from 30k to 45k), etc.



So "an equal chance of losing or gaining X" would not be attractive to such a person. Why not? Because relative to any point "losing X" reduces my utility more than "gaining X" increases it.



E.g., in the above example, if you started at 15K income you wouldn't want to have an equal chance of losing or gaining 15K in income. Having 0 income would be terrible, while having 30k income would be better, but not 'that much' better.  As we said, the utility difference between 0 and 15K is much larger than
