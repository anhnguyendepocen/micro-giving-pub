*Goals of this lecture (and accompanying self-study)*

- Overview of (re)-aquaintance with maths tools we will use

- Flavour of what *empirical* microeconomics is, key issues in empirical work

<!-- . . . -->

*Covers:*

- Nicholson/Snyder Chapter 1a: Mathematics used in Microeconomics
<aside class="notes">Skimmed very briefly, you should know most of this,

    Here I give a 'calculus for dummies' to make this clearer</aside>



<aside class="notes">The math is here to help you, don't let it scare you,

and don't worry if you don't understand everything; we will cover it again in context</aside>




<aside class="notes">Do: Understand what the math is about and how to use it.

Don't worry about memorizing 'cookbook rules' that can be easily looked up.</aside>

##Simple stuff


(Univariate) Function
:     A 'map' from one or more *variables* $x$ to an outcome $y=f(x)$

- for each value of $x$ the function tells you a single value of $f(x)$; typically we assign $y=f(x)$

\

<aside class="notes">'Variables' are more formally called the 'arguments' of a function </aside>
<aside class="notes">LC: Put up and plot the function $f(x)=-10 +3x$ here.

e.g., if I fish for x hours in a day, how much money do I earn (consider a 10 pound license fee)</aside>


----

\

Linear function
:     A function of the form $y=a+bX$; e.g., $y = f(x) = -10 + 3x$

- Plotted as a straight line; intercept $a$, constant slope $b$

<aside class="notes">Adv, Maths: For linear functions $f(a X_1 + b X_2) = a f(X_1) + b f(X_2) $ for any values of $a$, $b$, $X_1$, and $X_2$

In particular 'the function of the average is the average of the functions'.

This does *not* hold in general for nonlinear functions</aside>


----


Slope of $y = f(x)$
:      The change in y for a given change in x.  'Rise over run' $(\Delta y / \Delta x)$.


<br> \bigskip

<!-- \pause -->

- Arc slope, point slopes

<aside class="notes">Arc slope is the slope over a range.

Point slope: slope of the tangent to a curve at a point

For linear functions these are the same</aside>

----

Nonlinear (univariate) function
            : A function $f(x)$ of a form other than $f(x) = y=a+bX$;


<!-- . . . -->


- E.g., a quadratic function $y = f(x) = a + bx + cx^2$
    - E,g, $y = f(x) = 10 - 2x + 3x^2$
- Or a logarithmic $y=ln(x)$ or exponential function $y = exp(x)$

<aside class="notes">I will try to limit things to linear and quadratic functions, and possibly exponential and log function</aside>
<aside class="notes">I will remind you of the rules for dealing with these whenever it is necessary.</aside>


----


\

For linear functions the slope is the same at any point. For nonlinear functions it may differ at each point.

but a different effect depending on where you start for a nonlinear function</aside>

Instantaneous rate of change (instantaneous slope)
:    The slope of the line *tangent* to the curve at a single point

<aside class="notes">Adv, Math: This is the limit of the 'rise over run' as the run goes to zero</aside>


<!-- . . . -->


- Convex function: Slope everywhere increasing, unique minimum where slope $=0$
- Concave function: Slope everywhere decreasing, unique *maximum* where slope $=0$

<aside class="notes">Quadratics are convex if the squared term has a positive sign ... dominates at large x</aside>


<aside class="notes">We will mainly deal with functions like these,

 with a single minimum or maximum that occurs at the unique point with slope zero. </aside>

<aside class="notes">Ex convex: Tiger's golf earnings per game as function of hours of golf retraining

Or cost per smoothie as function of employees behind smoothie counter.

Ex concave: how funny I am as function of beers I drink</aside>


----

Derivative of a function
:     A *derivative* of a function $f(x)$ is another function called $f'(x)$.
$f'(x)$ tells us the (point) *slope* of the function $f(x)$ at any point $x$.


<!-- . . . -->


- For example, the derivative of the function $f(x) = 2x + 3$ is $f'(x) = 2$
    - For this linear function the slope is a constant, 2

----

- E.g., the derivative of the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1$ is $f'(x) = 2x - 4$

<br> \bigskip

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("plotaquadfncnR.png")
```

----

- derivative of the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1$ is $f'(x) = 2x - 4$


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("plotaquadfncn_andderiv.png")
```



<!-- . . . -->


- E.g., the slope at $x=1$ is $f'(x;x=1) = 1*1 - 4 = -2

- The slope is zero where $f'(x)=2x-4=0$, or where $x=2$

    - *Is $x=2$ at a min, a max, or neither? How do we know?*

<!---
R code
fun1p <-function(x) 2*x -4
fun1 <-function(x)  x * x - 4*x+1
plot(fun1p,-.5,5,asp=1,xlim=c(-2,3),ylim=c(-3,4))
plot(fun1,-.5,5,asp=1,xlim=c(-2,3),ylim=c(-3,4),add=TRUE)
abline(h=-1:3, v=-3:3, col="gray", lty=3)

<aside class="notes">For some functions, there are simple rules for computing the derivative.
 You don't have to memorise the rules for this module; I will always tell you the derivative when you might need it.</aside>
<aside class="notes">LC: Plot 'slope of function' with same X-axis as function itself</aside>


## Minimum, maximum, or neither?

- $f'(x)$ is a function that tells us the slope of $f(x)$, or how $f(x)$ changes in $x$ at any point $x$
- In turn, the derivative of $f'(x)$ is called $f''(x)$.
    - Tells us how the *slope* changes as $x$ increases

Oversimplifying:

<aside class="notes">Adv, Math: Essentially, for a class of functions where the domain is not bounded</aside>

- slope always `r format_with_col("increasing","blue")` $\rightarrow$ $f''(x)>0$ everywhere $\rightarrow$ *convex* (u-shaped) function $\rightarrow$ single \textcolor{blue}{minimum} where $f'(x)=0$

<!-- \pause -->

- slope always `r format_with_col("decreasing","brown")` $\rightarrow$ $f''(x)<0$ everywhere  $\rightarrow$ *concave* (inverse-u) fncn  $\rightarrow$ single \textcolor{brown}{maximum} where $f'(x)=0$




## Functions of two or more variables (multivariate functions)

Utility, profit, cost, production, returns, etc.

- May depend on multiple variables/inputs
- Need to illustrate tradeoffs between these


<!-- . . . -->

$$y=f(x,z)$$

- $y$ may increase and/or decrease in $x$ and in $z$,

- The rate of increase of y in $x$ may depend on the values of $x$ and $z$

     - Similar for the rate of increase of y in z


<!-- . . . -->

E.g., $$y=\sqrt(xz) = x^{1/2}z^{1/2}, x \geq 0, z \geq 0$$

<aside class="notes">Examples: fun-ness of party = f(beer, snacks)

smoothies produced = f(labour hours, machines)</aside>


<aside class="notes">Note the outcome will increase in each argument at a decreasing rate

What does it look like? 3d: project up to y from a "map" of x and z coordinates on the desk

Hard to picture; 'contour lines' can help</aside>

----

Projecting a function up from X,Y space into the Z axis:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("doubledip.jpg")
```


## Contour lines (we will come back to this later!)

Contour lines
:     Level sets - depict combinations of variables that hold the function constant at a particular value
:     f(x,z) = A for some value $A$

Level sets: *E.g., indifference curves*, *isoquants* and *isocost* curves.


<aside class="notes">Don't worry if you find this discussion of level sets confusing

 We will come back to it later in the module for a more specific case</aside>

----

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("contourlines.jpeg")
```

<br> \bigskip

*Contour lines on a map*

<aside class="notes">It is difficult to depict more than 2 dimensions on a piece of paper.

So we find the values for the 2 variables that give us a particular value for the third.

Which tells us how these trade off.</aside>


----

Consider a production function:

$$Y = f(K,L) = \sqrt(KL)$$

<!-- . . . -->

Setting this equal to 1 we can map out 'all combinations of K and L that produce output $Y=1$':

<aside class="notes">By solving for the amount of K needed to produce 1 as a function of L

and then plotting this against a range of L</aside>

$$  Y = \sqrt(KL) = 1 \rightarrow KL = 1 $$

<!-- . . . -->

$$ \rightarrow K = 1/L $$

<!-- . . . -->

Setting this at Y = 2

$$  Y = \sqrt(KL) = 2 \rightarrow KL = 4 $$
$$ \rightarrow K = 4/L $$

## Simultaneous equations

![Simultaneous equations](simeqn.png)

<aside class="notes">Class: What does this 'cross' remind you of, that we have just seen?</aside>

----

E.g.,

$$ X + Y = 3 $$
$$ X - Y = 1 $$

\

Holds only where $X=2, Y=1$, the 'unique solution'

<aside class="notes">Be sure you know how to solve the above.</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv, math: Note, in general, we need as many equations as unknowns (above 2 of each) to *possibly* be able to find a solution.
 However, some sets of equations have *no* solution, and some may have *multiple* solutions. \textCR Consider plotting overlapping lines, or parrallel lines, and looking for the point(s) of intersection.</aside>

Meaningless to ask 'how does a change in X affect Y?' in the above context.

<aside class="notes">Equally meaningless: 'how does the price affect the quantity exchanged?' in a demand-supply Marshallian cross.</aside>



## Mini-lecture: Empirical microeconomics/econometrics {#empiricalmini}

\hypertarget{empiricalmini}{\beamerbutton{link}}




Empirical research

:     Uses evidence from the *real world*, i.e., observation, to answer questions

<aside class="notes">Evidence rather than introspection and theory</aside>


<!-- . . . -->

Econometrics
:     The 'science' of using data to answer economic questions. Uses statistical tools and often economic theory


<!-- . . . -->

Micro-data
:     Data where the unit of observation is an individual, household, firm, etc.

<aside class="notes">Contrasts from macro-data, data on aggregates like GDP, inflation, etc.</aside>

 <aside class="notes">Most of this module will cover economic theory and the application of this theory to the real world.

 We will refer to empirical *evidence* a bit; I want you to have some sense of how this is evidence is built.</aside>

<aside class="notes">LC: Give me an example of micro-data</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv: Econometrics often has a different focus and different methodology than 'regular statistics'.</aside>
<aside class="notes">Adv: Econometrics has taken on a larger role in economics over the past 40 years, because of greater data availability and computing power.
 Most published papers in economics now involve some econometric analysis.</aside>

## Empirical(ish) example

<aside class="notes">A bit advanced, don't worry if it goes above your head a little</aside>

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

Fit 'best' line (minimise error) through these points

- Estimate demand slope \& intercept, use to make inferences

- Never fits exactly. `r format_with_col("why not?","blue")`

<aside class="notes">Ans: unobserved differences, nonlinear demand, measurement error, randomness in behaviour</aside>



<aside class="notes">Advanced: Why is this *only* meaningful if we are observing shifts in the supply curve and not the demand curve?</aside>



----

### Ceteris paribus

> All [most] economic theories employ the assumption that 'other things are held constant.'

- Above, demand may differ between weeks/stores, weather changes,  etc.


<!-- . . . -->


> the points may lie on several different demand curves, and attempting to force them into a single curve would be a mistake.

$\rightarrow$ Carefully 'control' for other observable factors (a partial solution)


<aside class="notes">Can never control for everything or know 'true' functional form; sadly all *empirical* work involves imperfect compromises

But happily there are ways to test and validate the estimates, e.g., see how well they predict future outcomes</aside>


## Application 1A.3: ... Changing world oil prices (time-permitting)

<aside class="notes">This is a great example from perhaps the most important global market, with tremendous fluctuations that have huge impacts.

 It shows the power of empirical microeconomics.</aside>

$$ Q = 85 - 0.4P \: (D) $$
$$ Q = 55 + 0.6P \: (S) $$

Approximates 2000-2002 price


----

*Why did price rise to US\$130 in 2008 and fall to \$50 by March '09?*

<!-- . . . -->

- China \& India's economies grew $\rightarrow$ growth in the world economy by 3-4\% per year
    - (Various calculations) $\rightarrow$ Demand shifts out from  $Q_D = 85 - 0.4P$ to:

<aside class="notes">I think the 'new demand' curve comes from an approximation:

if the world economy grew at 4\% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it's previous size. ... thus the growth is $1.047^7=1.316$.

They assume oil's demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112.

Note that the NS text has a typo: equation 3 on page 40, the new demand, should read $Q=112-0.4P$.</aside>

$$Q_D = 112 - 0.4P$$
$$Q_S = 55 + 0.6P$$


$\rightarrow$ solves to $P=57, Q=87$

#Lecture2:  Utility and Choice [Chapter 2: 1-2 hours]


##Motivation

Consider a decision you recently made?

<br> \bigskip

- Define this decision clearly.

- How do you think you decided among these options?


<!-- \pause -->

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

<aside class="notes">What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the same decision?

If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same situation again. Do you think you'd make the same decision?</aside>

----

Suppose I asked you

'State a rule that governs (determines/characterizes) how people *do* make decisions'...

<!-- . . . -->

<br> \bigskip

I want this rule to be...

1. Informative (it rules *out* at least some sets of choices)

2. Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule)

----

Similar question:

'State a rule that governs how people *should* make decisions'..

 <br> \bigskip

By 'should' I mean that *they will not regret having made decisions in this way.*

<!-- \pause -->

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

----

\Huge If people *did* follow these rules, what would this imply and predict? \normalsize

<!-- \pause -->

Rules defined as 'axioms about preferences'


<!-- . . . -->


'Standard axioms'  $\rightarrow$ (imply that) choices can be expressed by 'individuals maximising *utility functions* subject to their *budget constraints*'


$\rightarrow$ yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc.

<aside class="notes">Economists and decision theorists have tried to come up with and defend such rules.

 They have started from these `reasonable axioms' and follow their logical implications for \textCR
individual choices, individual responses to changes in prices and income,

market prices and quantities and their responses,

`welfare' and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc.</aside>
