\textbf{Notes by instructor David Reinstein, largely based on
Nicholson/Snyder, Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application, 12th
edition (other editions OK too).}

This text forms the basis for roughly 80-90\% of this module. I
recommend you purchase, or find easy access to some edition of this book
(new editions should be £50, used editions should be cheaper). In future
I hope to rely completely on open-source (free) resources, but I'm not
there yet.

\section{Notes to students on how to read this set of lecture
notes2}\label{notes-to-students-on-how-to-read-this-set-of-lecture-notes2}}

Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics!

I hope that this module helps you see the world in a new way and gain
insights about business, government, and your everyday life. If you put
the time into this module, you can get a lot out of it, and you may gain
skills and access approaches that you will use throughout your career.
As students at a Russell group institution, I expect you to work hard
and engage intellectually to gain a serious and critical understanding
of key Economics concepts. Learn how and when these can be applied, what
their limitations are, and how these can these are misused and
misunderstood. I hope you learn these core ideas well enough that you
could explain them to others and apply them to unfamiliar situations.

This is not necessary to gain a good mark: I hope that you all will be
able to gain a good mark, and I will try to be lenient. But I would
suggest you aspire to get \emph{more} out of this than a mark.

You should aim not only to achieve a distinction mark, but to be able to
impress me with your understanding and insight, to gird your loins for
future courses applying this material, and to gain the acumen to
understand key research issues, and participate in business discussions
and policy debates.

I wrote these notes to outline all of the material you are responsible
for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the
short amount of time we have during lecture. I \emph{don't} mean you're
simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that
these notes will aim to \emph{refer to} everything that you are
responsible for.

These notes are meant to be a complement to the textbook (and to the
lectures, tutorials/problem sets, readings and other material on the
ELE) and to tie all of this together.

I am providing you these notes both as a complete file as well as
divided by lecture week (approximately). Use either version.

I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in these notes.
However, each year the module adjust slightly as we go and I will need
to make updates to these notes as we go along. I will try to keep you
informed of any changes via the VLE forums.

\bigskip

\emph{Notes versus slides?:}

These notes should include all of the slide material \emph{plus}
explanatory notes and enrichment material. I use some abbreviations
before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will
also try to make the slides themselves available after the lectures,
even though they are redundant-- these notes have everything.

\bigskip

\emph{Some `markers' and abbreviations:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  `NS' refers to the Nicholson and Snyder text (usually
  chapters/numbering from the 12th edition is referenced; if you're
  using an earlier edition, make sure the content corresponds)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textcolor{RawSienna}{'Adv'} indicates advanced material and
  discussion you are not required to know but may find interesting, and
  will help you in later courses/modules in Economics, and give you a
  hint at what is to come if you pursue this course further. Knowing
  this stuff might also help your mark and the impression you make when
  asking for letters of reference.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is also included to give you a more nuanced picture: when I
    took a similar module as an undergraduate I tended to believe `all
    the economics problems are solved and the solutions and implications
    are obvious.' These `Adv' comments are often caveats and
    \emph{critiques}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{RawSienna}{'Adv, math'} indicates advanced mathematical
material. (I've moved most of this to footnotes).

\textcolor{blue}{Text in blue usually  refers to questions you should  try to answer on your own (and I sometimes provide suggested answers in the footnotes. Try to answer it yourself first.)}

\textcolor{gray}{Some text is given in gray  to indicate that this is a side point or a discussion. (I'm moving most of this to footnotes.)}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  `LC' indicates a lecturer comment I may make in lecture that you don't
  need to worry about (I meant to cut these but I sometimes forget to)
\item
  `Comprehension Q:' A question you should be able to answer if you are
  following along.
\item
  `T numbers' (take these loosely please) refer to the weeks of term
  that intended to cover specific material.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For example `T1:03 - T1:04a' means `term 2 week three (both
    lectures) and term 2 week 4, first lecture only'
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Some quick notes on this module and how it fits into your course
structure}

This module is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Compulsory for BSc Business Economics and BA Business Economics
\item
  Also for PPE I believe
\end{itemize}

The prerequisites are BEE1029 (for most students) or BEE1034 or BEE1030
and BEE1031

The prerequisites are very different, the students in this module may
come from diverse \emph{backgrounds}.

We will try to focus on material:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  not covered in BEE1029 or
\item
  more rigorous and detailed versions of this, and
\item
  real world applications, especially in business.
\end{itemize}

Some of you may have already seen some of the material covered here. If
so, try to learn it in more detail, become better at explaining it to
others, and learn to apply it to real-world issues.

\bigskip

\emph{Note: From 2020 onwards, all students in this module will come
from the ``CORE ESPP''}

\url{https://www.core-econ.org/espp/}

You may also find this to be a useful resource, for revision,
motivation, and as a supplement to the Nicholson/Snyder text

(Also, see ``The Economy'' 1.0)
\url{https://www.core-econ.org/project/core-the-economy/} for more
straight Economics

\bigskip

\emph{A note on maths}:

As I will explain, this course will involve a certain level of maths;
things like simple algebra, understanding what functions are and how to
draw them, and understanding the very basic idea that `the derivative of
a function is a function telling you the slope of the original
function'. If you are math-phobic, you need to try to get over this and
make maths your friend and your horse. You can ride it for miles!

You will also come to notice that I emphasize logic, precise
definitions, and careful connected explanations. I \emph{don't} want you
to be saying/writing things that could be interpreted in multiple ways,
like ``the demand will go up''.

However, this is not the core \emph{Economics} module (bee2038:
Microeconomics II). If you want a more precise, theoretically complete
and mathematically rigorus treatment of this material, particularly if
you are studying Economics and/or want to go to postgraduate study in a
related field you probably should switch to that module.

Further suggested maths resources are given below, under
(\#Other-maths-resources).

\bigskip

\emph{2018: Note to students in Managerial economics who took the
BEE1034 `Economics for Management' last term}

I realise that you are facing a special challenge this year because of
the changes in this particular prerequisite module, with less
`conventional Economics' covere .

In 2018 I discussed with your student-staff liaison committee chair on
how to give you further support. One of the things she suggested was to
point you in the direction of the text Edexcel AS/A level Economics.
This should be accessible online. I have looked through this book and I
agree that it will be helpful both as a prerequisite and to give you a
more basic explanation (A-levels) of some of the things that we are
covering in this module.

In particular (note these chapters are very short):

\emph{From ``theme one: introduction to markets and market failure''}

Chapter one: Economics as a social science

Chapter 3: the economic problem

Chapter 4: production possibility frontiers

Chapter 7: rational decision-making

Chapter 8: Demand (super-important!) but please don't use their somewhat
imprecise language "fall/increase in demand/increase in demand)

(Chapters 9 and 10 are essentially re-covered from scratch in our
module, going beyond A-level material)

\bigskip

Chapter 11: Supply

Chapter 12: price determination

Chapter 13: the price mechanism (much of Chapters 14, 15, and 16 cover
material overlapping what we are covering, again at a more basic
`A-levels' level; you may find these helpful)

\emph{From `Theme 3: business behaviour and the labour market'}

Chapter 42: revenue

Chapter 43: Production

chapter 44: Costs (we don't get to all of this in this module)

chapter 45: profit

Chapter 46: market structure (just to get the basic idea)

Chapter 47: perfect competition

Chapter 50: monopoly (we re-cover much of this and go a bit further)

(Much of these chapters in theme 3, as well as chapter 54, overlaps what
we are covering, but at the A-level)

I also highly recommend the microeconomics material from the Khan
Academy; I will also give you an outline of which sections are most
relevant there.

Of course I am also very accessible if you have any questions or need
clarification, or just want to talk about some of the material you are
struggling with. As I always say, you should feel free to come by my
office hours or to make a special appointment outside of these hours I
think students who have come to my office hours will definitely agree
that they have found been helpful and not stressful. I also encourage
you to ask specific questions on the ELE student forum which I will
answer carefully. You can also ask questions directly on any of the
dropbox hosted files if you get a free dropbox account, and I will try
to respond to all of these.

\emph{From the handbook, here is the official outline of the module:}

\begin{quote}
Narrative: The module is also designed to equip students with the key
microeconomic principles necessary for the analysis of a range of basic
economic problems and policies. It seeks, in particular, to increase the
students' abilities to, independently, pose and solve economic
questions, especially those relating to policy issues. It emphasises the
fundamental conceptual foundations in microeconomics and provides
concrete examples of their applications.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lectures
\item
  Problem sets: There are eight problem sets, each covering a specific
  block of material. \emph{The material in these problem sets either
  comes from exams or builds exam skills.}
\end{itemize}

Representative answers for each problem set will be given a few days
after each problem set is released, or shortly before the relevant
support class.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Classes (AKA `tutorials' AKA `seminars') every fortnight (5 total)
\end{itemize}

Support classes will largely focus on covering (exploring, solving,
discussing) the problem sets. However, there will obviously not be time
to cover every question in the tutorial. Note there are only 5 tutorials
but 8 problem sets; thus, tutorials may cover problems from multiple
recent problem sets.

These classes are about \emph{applying} material you have learned, not
lecturing on it or learning it for the first time.

\bigskip

\emph{Come ready to ask questions and participate:}

The classes are a smaller group setting than the lectures;

we aim to make these highly interactive and participatory. To really be
helpful, we need to know what areas you might be struggling with and
where your logic might be breaking down; thus we will either do cold
calling or highly encourage all the students in these tutorials to ask
and answer questions. Think of these as (especially) `safe spaces'; you
will be judged or marked based on your performance in the support
classes, and there are no dumb questions. If you have a question many of
your peers probably have the same question, so asking it provides a
\emph{public good}.

\subsubsection{1. Economic basics (weeks
1-2)}\label{economic-basics-weeks-1-2}}

\underline{Economic models and basic maths tools, introduction (NS ch. 1)}
\underline{Preferences, utility, indifference curves, budget constraints (NS ch. 2)}

In weeks one and two we will go over some of the simple tools in the
economists' kit. I will try to explain to you what we mean by `economic
models' and give you some examples of these which may be familiar to
you. I will not go over the math tools in the lecture; you should
study/revise this on your own. We \emph{will} go over many of these
again briefly as we apply these math tools to our economic models
throughout the module.

We will also start thinking about, and formalisng individual
decisions---over nearly all spheres of life--- in a way you may not have
seen before, which may even strike you as weirdly hyper-rational.

Essentially, this (sometimes confusingly called `normative decision
theory') is the way economists typically conceive of and model people's
choices. Even though it seems to require precise optimization, perhaps
to a strange extent, there are various reasonable justifications for
this, and you might also see it as a benchmark\ldots{} `Let's understand
what optimization would look like, as a starting point'.

This framework is actually fairly general; it can allow all sorts of
preferences (e.g., embodying `risk aversion' and `altruism') and
wide-ranging choices. However it \emph{does} imply certain
`restrictions': it rules out some sort of behavior that is perhaps
obviously illogical.

We will discuss how `preferences' may define the `utility functions'.
The `uility function' is the thing that make choices in order to
maximize. In the classical framework, people make choices in order to
maximise the value of their utility function. Utility functions can also
be expressed in terms of `indifference curves' (but keep the distinction
in mind; the indifference curves are not themselves the utility
functions).

Under this framework individuals make the `optimal choices' \ldots{} by
making the choices that yield the maximum value of the utility functions
given their constraints \ldots{} in particular they have a `budget
constraint' that says they cannot spend more than they earn. You will
learn how to derive these budget constraints and plot these on a graph,
along with the indifference curves, and to interpret these diagrams.

\subsubsection{2. Building the model, putting it together, examining it
(weeks
3-5)}\label{building-the-model-putting-it-together-examining-it-weeks-3-5}}

`What determines the price and quantities exchanged in an unregulated
(or 'free') market?' `Do markets yield good outcomes?'

These questions have been at the backbone of Economics for millennia, at
least since Aristotle.

Classical economists such as Adam Smith built-up ideas of how seemingly
random and disorganized markets can yield predictable and efficient
outcomes, at least under appropriate conditions. Neoclassical and modern
economists (such as Alfred Marshall, David Ricardo, Leon Walras, and
Paul Samuelson) have formalized these, building models involving of
systems of demand and supply and general equilibrium, and have made the
case for the efficiency and desirability of the free market outcomes, at
least under specified conditions. \footnote{Much of this work has tried
  to specify more and more \emph{general} conditions for this, requiring
  less and less stringent assumptions.}

In the second (and largest) chunk of the course, we will learn some of
the essential building blocks of this model, and how they are justified
and put together to yield predictions for market outcomes and `welfare'.
In the process, we will get useful ideas and intuitions about the
working of markets.

\underline{Demand curves: Individual and market demand (NS ch. 3)}

We will learn how individual optimization implies a relationship between
the price of a good (and the consumer's income) and the amount a
consumer chooses to purchase of that good; her individual \emph{demand
curve}.

Adding up these individual demand curves yields the \emph{market demand
curve}, which describes the way the \emph{total} amount of a good
consumers wish to purchase depends on the market price of that good.

\underline{Production, costs, returns to scale, choice of inputs}

\textcolor{gray}{Note: This is covered NS ch. 6-7, but reading these sections is optional. You are only responsible for the brief 'sketch' of this that I provide in this handout and in a short lecture, and any problem sets related to this.}

Someone has to make this stuff, you know! We consider `production
functions' that map how inputs can be turned into outputs. If firms are
seeking to maximize profits, then whatever output they want to produce
\ldots{} they will try to produce it using the combination of inputs
(Capital, labor, etc.) that can do this at the lowest cost. If we know
production functions and input costs, we can describe a firm's cost of
producing every amount of a particular good.

\underline{Profit maximisation and supply, perfect competition in a single market (NS ch. 8-9)}

Economists typically assume that firms make choices to maximize profits.
(Mathematically, this `optimisation', i.e., maximisation, has some
things in common with the consumer optimisation of utility, so it may
look familiar).

Knowing their cost of production and the demand curve they will face,
firms will thus choose to produce the \emph{amount} that yields them the
highest profit; we will explain the conditions for this.

With `free entry/exit of firms' we have the (ideal) situation of
\emph{perfect competition}.

\underline{Supply curves, entry/exit, CS and PS, tax incidence, general equilibrium and welfare (brief)}

Each firm's supply curve is added up to generate the market supply
curve; we consider this in both the `short and long run'. We define the
concepts of `consumer surplus' and `producer surplus'; adding these
yields the total value in an economy or the total `social welfare'.

We will briefly and roughly consider the idea of an \emph{equilibrium}
in all markets; prices such that quantity demanded equals quantity
supplied for all outputs and inputs. We will get some sense of the idea
of what general `economic efficiency' means.

I will state and give you some intuition behind the `first and second
welfare theorems'; the conditions under which free markets yield `good
outcomes', defined in a particular sense.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{how-the-market-can-go-wrong-and-how-to-maybe-fix-it-weeks-6-7}{%
\subsubsection{3. How the market can go wrong (and how to maybe fix it)
(weeks
6-7)}\label{how-the-market-can-go-wrong-and-how-to-maybe-fix-it-weeks-6-7}}

Notice I kept saying ``under certain conditions'' free markets yield
good outcomes. These conditions may not hold, for various reasons. In
the third chunk, we discuss two of these reasons, which lead to `market
failures'. It is important to understand these. These (sometimes) offer
a justification for government intervention, and help us understand how
government can best respond. These also offer insights for business
models; which `goods' may be hard to provide without government
subsidies, and how can we use technological innovation to capture value
and reduce the extent of market failures? (Businesses may also be able
to take advantage of market failures in ways that are harmful to public
welfare, But I would hate to think I'm training you to do this.)

\underline{Market failures -- Public goods (NS, ch. 16, parts)}

Not all goods can easily be restricted to a single consumer. `Non-rival'
and `non-excludable' goods (e.g., a fireworks display) are called
\emph{public goods}: these will tend to be undersupplied by the free
market, as we will come to understand. We will also discuss the evidence
for the private provision of these, and consider government's ability to
provide them.

\underline{Monopolies; price discrimination as an imperfect remedy (NS ch. 11.2-4; supplemental readings)}

This is the polar opposite market structure to perfect competition; a
monopoly is a single firm that exclusively dominated a particular
industry. It will tend to produce less and charge more than would be
socially optimal, yielding a `deadweight loss' (aka `DWL').

`Price discrimination' is (more or less) when a firm charges different
prices to different consumers; this can reduce (or increase) the
`deadweight loss' of monopoly, as we will learn.

\hypertarget{extensions-to-the-model-and-applications-weeks-8-10}{%
\subsubsection{4. Extensions to the model and applications (weeks
8-10)}\label{extensions-to-the-model-and-applications-weeks-8-10}}

In the final chunk we extend the model to accommodate some important
aspects of the real world. We investigate the implication of these for
market outcomes.

\underline{Uncertainty (basic concepts, EU, risk aversion, investment choices) (NS ch. 4; supplements on finance)}

We make many decisions without knowing exactly what the consequence of
each choice will be. Economists typically model this using the
``expected utility'' framework. A warning: students often get this
concept wrong, so be careful. Expected utility is not the same as
`expected monetary value'; and this allows EU to embody risk aversion.

\underline{Game theory; experimental evidence on this (NS ch. 5, supplements)}

For many decisions we make the consequences depend on what \emph{others}
do; we have `strategic interaction'. Economist usually consider this
using the framework and tools of \emph{game theory}.

\underline{Limits to cognition, willpower, self-interest; applications and evidence (NS ch 16, supplements)}

People may not actually make decisions In the hyper-rational way we have
been assuming. Here we carefully consider the adaptation of some
insights from Psychology to Economics, yielding `behavioral economics'

\emph{Skills to hone and build.} Your success in this module will depend
in large part on building and applying basic maths skills and tools
(mainly at the GCSE level), and strong reading/writing/logic abilities.
You should build the ability to comprehend and respond carefully and
logically to nuanced questions (essay/short answer, solved problem, and
multiple choice). These problem will incorporate quantitative reasoning,
logic, and the ability to understand and clearly express ideas, to
correctly characterise and describe theories and evidence, and to apply
learned principles to new situations.

\textrm{Economists do not know everything: We know very little but we have thought through many arguments}

\emph{It may seem like we have the answers, but this is only where we
have asked the questions very carefully}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textrm{Most non-economists do not fully understand these arguments, and they make mistakes, and they worry.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  But sometimes ignorance is bliss.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Examples:} Sunk-cost fallacy, gains to trade/comparative
advantage, opportunity cost, free-riding/prisoners' dilemma,
double-marginalization,`raise price to raise profit', etc.

I've had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife.
Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textrm{Humans are not like billiard balls, universal rules are hard to come by.}

We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions,
usually assuming things like a `single representative consumer'. These
models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights.

However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or
testing these models, be careful; people may differ and they may change
and they may have multiple motives.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections
in existing markets \(\rightarrow\) opportunities.}\\

I don't want you to go away thinking that economists believe, `markets
solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds'. The
simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds,
but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most
economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe
that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many
cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these
market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of
fixing them, or ends up making things worse.

I'm not telling you what \emph{you} need to believe, I just don't want
you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics.

As I also mentioned, these apparent imperfections or market failures
actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things
that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new
frameworks.

Here are some possible examples.\\

\emph{Imperfection:} Inefficient monopoly markups for information
goods\\

\(\rightarrow\) `All you can eat' \(\rightarrow\)
\textcolor{blue}{Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited}\\
~\\

\textcolor{gray}{When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for 'all-you-can-eat' And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later.}

Free-riding on public goods\\

\(\rightarrow\) \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Disneyworld, resorts}\\

\textcolor{gray}{We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride.  They then charge an admission fee to 'be inside of Disney World' and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods.}

Imperfection: Lack of information about `experience goods', lack of
trust in one-shot-interactions\\

\(\rightarrow\) \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Uber, AirBnb}\\

Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we
won't cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a
product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no
one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not
trust its quality, the so-called `lemons problem' or `adverse
selection'. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet
sites like Uber and Air B\&B, can help reduce this problem and create
new markets (and profit for themselves).

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Shyness and fear of `losing face'\\

\(\rightarrow\) \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Tinder}

Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each
other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being
rejected. Even though both would like to be `partnered', neither will
make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high.

A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only
share information about `Mutual matches'. Once again, this will create
fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to
profit.

\textcolor{gray}{If you're interested, see my research on this}

\bigskip

Asymmetric information, adverse selection\\

\(\rightarrow\) \textcolor{ForestGreen}{NHS, 'Obamacare'}

This one \emph{is} a government intervention, obviously. However,
private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and
healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more
Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world,
there are private providers like BUPA.

Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of `adverse selection'.
A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to
those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health
insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization.
Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that
reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this,
healthier people may be `priced out of the market', i.e., prefer to not
obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy
people may be `risk-averse', and would benefit from purchasing
`actuarially fair insurance' (We will define these terms later).

There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance (
or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these
situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and
proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama
administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands' system as well.

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you 'outsource' And when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do?}

\textcolor{gray}{What sort of models are we talking about?
To refresh your memory... you have probably seen some of these models before in your first economics module. You should have some familiarity with the simple models of supply and demand curves yielding an equilibrium price and quantity. You may also have seen a models of trade, between two countries or two individuals, with only two goods, where for each good one has a 'comparative advantage'.
}

Consider: Are they `fully realistic'? No.~They are models, i.e.,
simplifications.

A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and
`general'; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or
reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications.

\hypertarget{why-learn-these-models}{%
\subsection{Why learn these models?}\label{why-learn-these-models}}

Consider the parable of the tortoise and the hare (Aesop)\ldots{}

\medskip

\includegraphics[height=2.3in]{picsfigs/tortoisehare.jpg}

\bigskip

\footnotesize

One might question the realism of this story:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Can hares really speak?
\item
  Is this a rabbit or a hare?
\item
  What other animals were racing?
\end{itemize}

Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important
message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above
questions?

The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models.
Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular
models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the
assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from
these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in
considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms
can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject
economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we
do not reject Aesop's fables because they involve talking animals. The
idea of `Ceteris paribus' (all other things being equal) can help us
here.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

What do models give us?

\emph{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{There are different views of this}}

Via logic and mathematics:

\textbf{Assumptions \(\rightarrow\) Results}\\

\bigskip

and sometimes these also yield testable predictions (if the assumptions
hold)

\bigskip

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: When considering and evaluating these models, you can critique only the assumptions;
the results are logically/mathematically proven although when the results contradict real-world evidence this hints that the assumptions may be substantially wrong.}

Do these simplified models yield conclusions that are relevant to the
more complicated real world? Maybe, and sometimes. We will consider the
evidence.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{So why learn these models?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A starting point
\item
  (Sometimes) make concrete predictions you can test
\item
  Building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking
\item

  or extend them

\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/PPF_text.png}

Above, we see a depiction of the ``production possibility frontier''
(PPF), explained in the figure's caption. You may be familiar with this
from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one
good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another
good being produced.

\textcolor{gray}{I'm not sure if I would call it a 'model', but it certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions. This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now.}

Note:
\textcolor{RawSienna}{For comprehension: *Draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means*. \ *See fig 1.1*  \ *Advanced: Consider ... what assumptions does the PPF (implicitly) make?*}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{PPF illustrates key principles}

Principle 1: Scarce Resources

Principle 2: Scarcity involves opportunity cost.\\

\emph{Notes:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses
  that are foregone producing it.
\item
  The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone `next best'
  opportunity from a choice.
\item
  I may just call this `cost'
\end{itemize}

\emph{Comprehension question (advanced):}
\textcolor{blue}{Think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the  'cost' and the economists' definition of an 'opportunity cost'}

On the PPF the opportunity cost of more clothing is less food.\\

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Principle 3: Opportunity costs are (often) increasing.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its
  opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases.
\end{itemize}

\emph{To produce more and more clothing you would have to give up
increasing amounts of food.}

\begin{itemize}

  Determined by the preferences, behaviour, and costs of potential
  buyers and sellers
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note: in 2019 we will not be covering the historical background to
the Marshallian cross (the demand and supply you may be familiar with).
However, I do expect you to understand this model itself.}

\hypertarget{marshalls-model-of-supply-and-demand}{%
\subsection{Marshall's Model of Supply and
Demand}\label{marshalls-model-of-supply-and-demand}}

Economists and philosophers have long sought to explain `what determines
the prices, and why do they change the way they do?'

In the 19th century UK prices were falling while quantities were
increasing; this was a puzzle.

Alfred Marshall argued that a good's price must equal \emph{both} the
cost to produce and the value (to consumers) of the last unit produced
and consumed.

He introduced the `demand curve'; \emph{with a downward slope}.

This slope was justified by `satiation': for an individual, additional
units of a good are usually valued less and less. For example, you might
be willing to pay thousands of pounds to be able to access 100 gallons
of water rather than no water at all, but if you already have access to
a thousand gallons of water, you will not be willing to pay very much
for an additional 100 gallons.

Furthermore, firms must cater to less and less keen consumers as they
wants to sell more and more units. We come back to this later in the
module.

\bigskip

`Willingness to pay' (wtp) becomes less and less for the next unit
purchased, so will buy more only at a lower price. Equivalently, at a
lower price more people find the value exceeds the price, and for
additional units.

\textcolor{gray}{Note that we will also return to these questions in more depth in later chapters as we build up the demand and supply curves.}

\bigskip

With `single crossing' (a fancy condition you can ignore in this module)
there is a unique price where \(Q^s(p)=Q^d(p)\), and a unique quantity
where the last unit's value to the consumer equals its cost to produce.

\textbf{Scissors analogy}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The equilibrium model is analogised to a pair of scissors; neither
  \emph{scis} cuts alone
\end{itemize}

So \emph{don't} ask `how does the price affect the quantity exchanged'?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textcolor{blue}{Understand why} `Just like neither scis cuts alone,
  neither the supply nor the demand curve determines the equilibrium
  price and quantity in isolation'?
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: Consider: What does it mean to be at equilibrium, and how do we get there?}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\emph{Draw: the famous Marshallian cross} \emph{Can you explain?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The inefficiency of any price other than where \(Q^D(p)=Q^S(p)\)?
\item
  If the price was set at a different value, what forces might push it
  to the equilibrium?
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\emph{Suggested ans:}

To economists, a `shortage' is where, at the prevailing or imposed
price, consumers are willing to buy more than is available. Some
consumers get value from the good in excess of the price.\\

In such a case, firms might offer a higher price, or sellers might ask
for a higher price. The price rise would reduce quantity demanded (not
`reduce demand') ~and increase quantity supplied (not `reduce supply').

\item

\emph{`Verifying' economic models} by examining validity of

\emph{DR: `Verifying' is a bit too black and white'; all models have
limitations.}

\bigskip

\emph{Note:} \textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv:}
\textcolor{gray}{The text is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions.  However, there are many cases in which the *predictions* of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms.  On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as 'constant relative risk aversion' or 'geometric discounting' can be very credibly tested.  We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure 'how close' behavior is to the assumption.}

well in one particular case but not in general.}

Q6. ``Gasoline sells for \$4.00 per \emph{gallon} this year, and it sold
for \$3.00 per gallon last year. But consumers bought more gasoline this
year than they did last year. This is clear proof that the economic
theory that people buy less when the price rises is incorrect.'' Do you
agree? Explain.

Q8. (This one is conceptual and somewhat tricky!) `'Housing advocates
often claim that ``the demand for affordable housing vastly exceeds the
supply. Use a supply-demand diagram to show whether you can make any
sense out of this statement. In particular, show how a proper

\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\emph{Covers:}

I am `curating' some materials to help you revise the maths if you are
having some difficulties there.

Firstly, note that the Nicholson and Snyder text has a very relevant and
useful appendix 2 chapter 1 specifically covering the most important
maths; I have also echoed these in the handout. I covered it in some
previous years (can you view the recap HERE? I covered it from minute
31, about), but it didn't seem so helpful to try to cram all of this
into a lecture, so I stopped doing it.

Warwick maths notes

The University of Warwick put up some decent `refresher notes' for
incoming economic students. I've re-hosted these on my Dropbox, with
some comments on which parts are more relevant. (And remember, with a
free dropbox account you can add comments and questions directly on
these files which I will try to respond to).

\textbf{Khan} A \emph{very} good resource for maths learning/revision:

The Khan academy has really great well-designed course materials
including videos and all sorts of interactive resources.really, I think
this is the best place to learn this stuff!

Khan academy: \url{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/}, e.g., see their
introduction to differential calculus.

Some Khan courses/sections I would recommend in particular

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pre-algebra (you should know all of this)
\item
  Algebra basics (all of this)
\item
  Algebra I (nearly all of this is relevant, accepting a few things like
  irrational numbers)
\item
  Algebra II (`Functions' and possibly a few other parts)
\item
  Statistics (mainly just `discrete random variables'; especially the
  `mean')
\item
  Helpful: Calculus as `rates of change'; just the basic concept of a
  derivative
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[(Univariate) Function]
A `map' from one or more \emph{variables} (\(x\)) (or `variables') to an
outcome (\(y=f(x)\))
\end{description}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  for each value of \(x\) the function tells you a single value of
  \(f(x)\); typically we assign \(y=f(x)\)
\end{itemize}

Note: `Variables' are more formally called the `arguments' of a function

\bigskip

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Linear function]
A function of the form \(y=a+bX\); e.g., \(y = f(x) = -10 + 3x\)
\end{description}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Plotted as a straight line; intercept \(a\), constant slope \(b\)
\end{itemize}

(Technically this is an `affine' function; a linear function doesn't
have an intercept)

Adv, Maths: For strictly linear functions (not including functions with
constants)

\(f(a X_1 + b X_2) = a f(X_1) + b f(X_2)\)

for any values of \(a\), \(b\), \(X_1\) and \(X_2\)

In particular `the function of the average is the average of the
functions' (this also holds for affine functions). This does \emph{not}
hold in general for nonlinear functions.

\bigskip

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Slope of \(y = f(x)\)]
The change in y for a given change in x. `Rise over run'.
\end{description}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Arc slope: slope over a range
\item
  Point slope: slope of the tangent to a curve at a point
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Nonlinear (univariate) function : A function \(f(x)\) of a form other
than \(f(x) = y=a+bX\);

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  E.g., a quadratic function \(y = f(x) = a + bx + cx^2\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    E,g, \(y = f(x) = 10 - 2x + 3x^2\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Or a logarithmic \(y=ln(x)\) or exponential function \(y = exp(x)\)
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} I will try to limit things to linear and quadratic
functions, and possibly exponential and log functions. I will remind you
of the rules for dealing with these whenever it is necessary.

\bigskip

For linear functions the slope is the same at any point. For nonlinear
functions it may differ at each point.

\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{picsfigs/linearslope.jpg}
\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{picsfigs/nonlinearslope.jpg}

Think of the slope of a mountain versus the slope of a wheelchair ramp.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{picsfigs/linearquadratic.png}

The point here is that increasing X by 1 has the same effect on Y
wherever you start, for a linear function but a different effect
depending on where you start for a nonlinear function

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\includegraphics[height=2in]{picsfigs/concaveconvexquadratics.jpg}

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Instantaneous rate of change (instantaneous slope)]
The slope of the line \emph{tangent} to the curve at a single point
\end{description}

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv, Math: This is the limit of the 'rise over run' as the run goes to zero}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Convex function: Slope everywhere increasing, unique minimum where
  slope \(=0\)
\item
  Concave function: Slope everywhere decreasing, unique maximum where
  slope \(=0\)
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{gray}{Note: we are referring to the signed value of the slope here, not the absolute value. E.g., for the convex case depicted, it goes from a negative slope to a zero slope to a positive slope}

\bigskip

For \emph{these} functions the slope is different at each point.

Note: We will mainly deal with functions like these, with a single
minimum or maximum that occurs at the unique point with slope zero.

Quadratic function are convex if the \(x^2\) term has a positive sign
and concave if it has a negative sign. That's because at extreme values
of x the term with the largest exponent will dominate all other terms.

Example of a convex function: Tiger's golf earnings per game as function
of hours of golf retraining\ldots{} he had to get worse before he could
get better, they say.

Or cost per smoothie as function of employees behind smoothie counter.

One example of a concave function: how funny I am as function of beers I
drink (on the other hand, how funny I \emph{think} I am may be an
everywhere increasing function.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Derivative of a function]
A \emph{derivative} of a function \(f(x)\) is another function called
\(f'(x)\). \(f'(x)\) tells us the \emph{slope} of the function \(f(x)\)
at any point \(x\).
\end{description}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For example, the derivative of the function \(f(x) = 2x + 3\) is
  \(f'(x) = 2\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For this linear function the slope is a constant, 2
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textcolor{gray}{We will come back to the following examples later.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  E.g., the derivative of the quadratic function \(f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1\)
  is \(f'(x) = 2x - 4\)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{picsfigs/plotaquadfncnR.png}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  derivative of the quadratic function \(f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1\) is
  \(f'(x) = 2x - 4\)
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{picsfigs/plotaquadfncn_andderiv.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  E.g., the slope at \(x=1\) is \(f'(x;x=1) = 1*1 - 4 = -2\)
\item
  The slope is zero where \(f'(x)=2x-4=0\), or where \(x=2\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Is \(x=2\) at a min, a max, or neither? How do we know?}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{minimum-maximum-or-neither}{%
\subsection{Minimum, maximum, or
neither?}\label{minimum-maximum-or-neither}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(f'(x)\) is a function that tells us the slope of \(f(x)\), or how
  \(f(x)\) changes in \(x\) at any point \(x\)
\item
  In turn, the derivative of \(f'(x)\) is called \(f''(x)\). This tells
  us how the \emph{slope} changes as \(x\) increases
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Oversimplifying a bit:

\textcolor{RawSienna}{(Adv, Math: Essentially, for a class of functions where the domain is not bounded)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if the slope is always increasing, i.e., if \(f''(x)>0\) everywhere,
  the function is \emph{convex} (u-shaped), and has a single minimum
  where \(f'(x)=0\)
\item
  if the slope is always decreasing, i.e., if \(f''(x)<0\) everywhere,
  the function is \emph{concave} (inverse-u-shaped), and has a single
  maximum where \(f'(x)=0\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{multivar-functions}{%
\subsection{Functions of two or more variables (multivariate
functions)}\label{multivar-functions}}

Utility, profit, cost, production, returns, etc.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\item
  Need to illustrate tradeoffs between these
\end{itemize}

\[y=f(x,z)\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(y\) may increase and/or decrease in \(x\) and in \(z\)
\item
  The rate of increase of y in \(x\) may depend on the values of \(x\)
  and \(z\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Similar for the rate of increase of y in z
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

E.g., \[y=\sqrt(xz) = x^{1/2}z^{1/2}, x \geq 0, z \geq 0\]

Note the outcome will increase in each argument at a decreasing rate.

What does it look like? 3d: project up to y from a ``map'' of x and z
coordinates on the desk.

This is hard to picture; `contour lines' can help.

Level sets: \emph{E.g., indifference curves}, \emph{isoquants} and
\emph{isocost} curves.

\textcolor{gray}{Don't worry if you find this discussion of level sets confusing. We will come back to it later in the module for a more specific case.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\includegraphics[height=2.2in]{picsfigs/contourlines.jpeg}

Note: It is difficult to depict more than 2 dimensions on a piece of
paper. So we find the values for the 2 variables that give us a
particular value for the third \ldots{} which tells us how these trade
off.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Consider a production function:

\[Y = f(K,L) = \sqrt(KL)\]

\bigskip

Setting this equal to 1 we can map out `all combinations of K and L that
produce output \(Y=1\)'.

We do this by solving for the amount of K needed to produce 1 as a
function of L and then plotting this against a range of L

\bigskip

\[  Y = \sqrt(KL) = 1 \rightarrow KL = 1 \]

\bigskip

\[ \rightarrow K = 1/L \]

\bigskip

Setting this at Y = 2

\[  Y = \sqrt(KL) = 2 \rightarrow KL = 4 \] \[ \rightarrow K = 4/L \]

\emph{Note}: Be sure you know how to solve the above.

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv math: Note, in general, we need as many equations as unknowns (above 2 of each) to \emph{possibly} be able to find a solution.  However, some sets of equations have *no* solution, and some may have \emph{multiple} solutions.  Consider plotting overlapping lines, or parrallel lines, and looking for the point(s) of intersection.}

\bigskip

Meaningless to ask `how does a change in X affect Y?' in the above
context. Equally meaningless: `how does the price affect the quantity
exchanged?' in a demand-supply Marshallian cross.

\subsection{Empirical meta-example}\label{empirical-meta-example}}

\textcolor{gray}{(A bit advanced)}

Suppose we are trying to estimate the market demand curve; suppose we
hypothesize that this demand curve is a linear function. (I.e., suppose
we assume that quantity demanded is a linear function of price).

\[Q_d = a-bp\]

Suppose we know that price is changing because of cost changes, shifts
in supply curve, or the firm experimenting

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: Otherwise the problem is poorly identified, as demand and supply will jointly determine price}

We observe price and quantity data for a period where \emph{ceteris
paribus} is reasonable

\includegraphics[height=2in]{picsfigs/demanddata.png}

We try to fit the `best' line through these points (minimizing the
distances between the line and the points, or minimizing the `error' of
this predicted quantity)

We estimate the demand curve's slope and intercept. We can use this to
make inferences.

This line will never fit exactly, because of unobserved differences,
nonlinear demand, measurement error, randomness in behaviour.

But this fitted line is \emph{only} meaningful if we are observing
shifts in the \emph{supply curve and not the demand curve}!
\textcolor{blue}{(Can you explain why?)}

We can never control for everything or know `true' functional form.
Sadly, all \emph{empirical} work involves imperfect compromises.

But happily there are ways to test and validate the estimates, e.g., see
how well they predict future outcomes.

\textcolor{brown}{This will be probably skipped in lecture, but please read it. This will be referred to in problem sets/tutorials.}

This is a great example from perhaps the most important unified global
market, with tremendous fluctuations that have huge impacts. It shows
the power of empirical microeconomics. (Note edition 12 updates.)

Henceforth we will refer to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the \emph{market demand} curve, as a function of price (P) and other
  things, as \(Q_D(P,...)\) and
\item
  the \emph{market supply} curve, as a function of price (P) and other
  things, as \(Q_S(P,...)\).
\end{itemize}

The quantity (units of a good) that firms in the market are willing to
supply is a function of the price and other `background' things. The
total quantity that consumers in the market or willing to demand is a
different function of the price of other things. We typically these
`supply curve', and `demand curve', respectively, but I want to to think
of these as functions that can shift. I don't want you to write `demand
went down'; that is ambiguous.

The price where these quantities are equal is the `prevailing price in
the market'. We build this up throughout the next sections in more
detail.

Getting back to the example\ldots{}

Empirical work has estimated the equations below, the estimated supply
and demand curves expressed in dollars and millions of \emph{barrels},
from an earlier period:

\[ Q_D = 85 - 0.4P \: (D) \] \[ Q_S = 55 + 0.6P \: (S) \]

Setting \(Q_S=Q_D\) and solving this yields:
\(85 - 0.4P=55+0.6P \rightarrow P = 30, Q = 73\)

\textcolor{gray}{Note: This is the sort of simultaneous equation you should be able to solve.}

This approximates the 2000-2002 price

\bigskip

\emph{So what accounted for price rise in 2008 to about US\$130, and
then fall to US\$50 by March 2009?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  China and India's economy grew, implying a growth in the world economy
  by 3-4\% per year
\item
  Various calculations imply that this represents a shifting out in the
  Demand curve from \(Q_D = 85 - 0.4P\) to:
\end{itemize}

\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\]

\textcolor{gray}{\emph{Side note:} I think the 'new demand' curve comes from an approximation:  if the world economy grew at 4\% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it's previous size. ... thus the growth is $1.047^7=1.316$.
They assume oil's demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112.
Note that the text has a typo: equation 3 on page 40, the new demand, should read $Q=112-0.4P$.}

With the same supply curve and the new demand curve we have

\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\] \[Q_S = 55 + 0.6P\]

This \(\rightarrow\) solves to \(P=57, Q=87\)

Furthermore, overall price inflation, US\$ devaluation \(\rightarrow\)
accounts for about a price of US\$94

\bigskip

So why was did the price move to \$130?

Other changes included: Speculation, other disruptions. \emph{Supply}
may have also shifted (political turmoil, new sources of energy, etc.)

decision?

\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/mortys-mind-blower.png}

Suppose I asked you

`State a rule that governs how people \emph{do} make decisions'\ldots{}

I want this rule to be both

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Informative (it rules \emph{out} at least some sets of choices) and
\item
  Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule).
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Suppose I asked an apparently similar question:

`State a rule that governs how people \emph{should} make decisions'..

By `should' I mean that \emph{they will not regret having made decisions
in this way.}

\bigskip

If people \emph{did} follow these rules, what would this imply and
predict?

Economists (and decision theorists/decision scientists) have specificall
defined such rules in terms of `axioms about preferences'

They have started from these `reasonable axioms' and followed their
logical implications for individual choices, individual responses to
changes in prices and income, market prices and quantities and their
responses, `welfare' and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc.

The `Standard axioms' (imply that) choices can be expressed by
`individuals maximising \emph{utility functions} subject to their
\emph{budget constraints}'.

This yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc.

Make sure you are following along.

Can you answer the questions mentioned above and in the lecture?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  E.g., can you explain why (supply) demand curves slope (upwards)
  downwards?
\item
  Can you solve a system of two equations (supply, demand) for an
  equilibrium price and quantity?
\item
  What causes shifts versus movements along the demand curve?
\end{itemize}

At this point, you should be able to do problem set 1. Please do at
least get a start on it.

After week 1, before week 2 lectures, be sure you have read/understood
all of the `handout' and corresponding material up to this point.

To prepare for the week 2 lectures, you should look ahead at the
readings and handout material (below).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In particular, read and consider the material on `preference axioms',
  `utility functions', and how the latter are depicted using
  indifference curves. These are difficult and somewhat abstract
  concepts; try to test your understanding and bring questions (or ask
  these on the VLE)!
\item
  If you have time, please also start considering the budget constraints
  and conditions for consumer optimisation. In particular, the `bang for
  the buck' condition is something you will want to look at closely to
  get your head around it.

\emph{Notes:} We want to develop a model that can be used to show how we
make choices or decisions.

In the (neo) classical economics framework, your (optimising) choices
are determined by two things:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Preferences: what goods do you like?
\item
  Constraints: how much money do you have, what are the prices of the
  goods you buy?

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Utility]
``The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic
activity.''

Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions
\end{description}

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature }

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated, thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, 'utility', which is maximised.}

\hypertarget{utility-from-two-goods}{%
\subsection{Utility from two goods}\label{utility-from-two-goods}}

We may specify a ``utility function'' of two goods (or aggregations of
goods) \(X\) and \(Y\):

\[Utility = U(X,Y; other)\]

We can get a lot of insight from considering models Of an individual's
preferences over only two goods. These two `goods' could represent, for
example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Leisure and `goods consumption'
\item
  Food and non-food
\item
  Coffee and tea (holding all else constant)
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{blue}{Maths revision}: \(U(X,Y)\) expresses a \emph{function}
with two \emph{arguments}, X and Y.

\textcolor{gray}{At this point, you may want to return to the revision material covering functions of two or more variables.}
\protect\hyperlink{multivar-functions}{Math-multivariate functions}

\(U(X,Y)\) must take \emph{some} value for every positive value of X and
Y.

In \emph{general} a function of X and Y might increase or decrease in
either X or Y, or increase over some ranges and decrease over other
ranges of these two arguments.

For example, consider the function `altitude of land in Britain as a
function of degrees longitude and latitude'.

\(U(X,Y)\) expresses a \emph{general} function; I haven't specified
\emph{what} this function is.

E.g., it could be \(U(X,Y)=\sqrt(XY)\).

\hypertarget{measuring-and-comparing-utilities}{%
\subsection{Measuring and comparing
utilities}\label{measuring-and-comparing-utilities}}

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: This is a difficult but well-studied issue, as it is important for methodology and welfare analysis. In more detailed discussions, we might speak of 'cardinal utility', 'ordinal utility', etc.,  to indicate the ways we can or cannot compare utility between individuals and in response to policy changes.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Utility is not `observable and measurable in utils'
\end{itemize}

Utility is seen to govern an individual's \emph{choices} and thus it's
only inferred indirectly, from the \emph{choices} people make

\bigskip

\underline{Interpersonal comparisons are difficult}

Who gets `more' utility? We don't know.

Also, considering a transfer from Al to Betty: Is the reduction in Al's
utility more or less than the increase in Betty's?

\emph{Revealed preference:} if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a dog
was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat.

As we only get at utility through an \emph{individual's} decisions, we
have no reliable way to compare it across individuals.

\textcolor{gray}{However, there is work done in the field of public choice trying either to build this up from *axioms* (e.g., the veil of ignorance),
or by eliciting people's preferences over distributions through interesting surveys, experiments, and voting behavior.}

The following is \textcolor{red}{forbidden}: ``I cannot choose between a

these.''

\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{picsfigs/donkeybales.jpeg}

\textcolor{gray}{Why *wouldn't* I be able to express a preference? In the case above that seems strange, but for other cases it may be extremely difficult or painful to make a choice, or very hard to compare two things. Imagine if you were asked to choose between never seeing your mother or never seeing your father. In general, economists' standard approach assumes we have a consistent preference ranking over all possibilities, and choose accordingly.  Other social sciences see this differently/}

\textcolor{gray}{Also 'forbidden' in the classical model: the \emph{time} or \emph{frame} in which I make the *decisions* must not affect my choices. This will be relaxed when we discuss behavioral economics.}

Fancy notation: Either A preferred to B, B preferred to A, or A

\item
  If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer
  an Apple to a Cherry.
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{gray}{A similar idea holds if I am indifferent between one pair of these. If this seems confusing it may be because it is \emph{too} obvious (although behavioral and experimental economists claim to find violations).}

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: If you found someone who stricly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple,  you could make a lot of money out of them!}

\bigskip

In more detail\ldots{}

Intuitively: Transitive preferences are `internally consistent': If I
prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.

\bigskip

Loosely, I might expect this if I think that a person has preferences
that can be ranked in a normal way. The standard `utility framework'
takes this for granted. If we have any rule over preference such as
`more is better' or `tastier is better', this should hold. Also, someone
whose makes choices following preferences that are not transitive may
quickly be impoverished by a shrewd trader. We do not see this happening
in general.

\bigskip

If you found someone who strictly preferred a apple to a bananas, a
banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of
money out of them. This is easiest to illustrate if we allow these goods
to be non-discrete and assume `more is always better.'

\bigskip

It works as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\item
  Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry.
\item
  Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a
  tiny little extra small unit of banana (or `money').
\item
  Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra.
\item
  Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra.
\end{enumerate}

\ldots{} Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you've drained all of their
resources.

\textcolor{gray}{(Final) Exam question: What are 'transitive preferences'? Give an example of a person making choices that seem to reflect preferences that are \textit{not} transitive, and explain how you could 'pump money' from this person.}\footnote{Transitivity
  (internal consistency): If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I
  must prefer A to C. If `Intransitive Eddy' is offered 1 apple and 1
  banana and 1p, he chooses the apple. If he is offered 1 banana versus
  1 cherry and 1p, he chooses the banana. If he is offered 1 cherry
  versus 1 apple and 1p, he chooses the cherJjji Pump money from him:
  Buy an apple, a banana, and a cherry. Get him to buy a banana from
  you. Get him pay you 1p to trade his banana for your apple. Then get
  him to pay 1p to trade his apple for your cherry. Then get him to pay
  1p to trade his cherry for your banana. Then get him to pay 1p to
  trade his banana for your apple. Repeat ad nauseum.}

\#\#\#~3. More is better (`global nonsatiation')

\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{picsfigs/moreisbetter.png}

Perhaps this seems unreasonable? One way you might justify it: If the
product is a `bad' (e.g., pollution), redefine the product as the
\emph{absence} of the product.

The darkly shaded area above represents those combinations of X and Y
that are unambiguously preferred to the combination X*, Y*. This is why
goods are called `goods'; individuals prefer having more of any good
rather than less. Combinations of X and Y in the lightly shaded area are
inferior to the combination \(X^{\ast}, Y^{\ast}\), whereas those in the
questionable areas may or may not be superior to \(X^{\ast}, Y^{\ast}\).

\hypertarget{who-cares}{%
\subsubsection{Who cares?}\label{who-cares}}

\textbf{If people obey the first two above assumptions/axioms, the
completeness and transitivity\(\ast\), they will make choices in a way
consistent with maximising a (continuous) \emph{utility} function.}
(\ldots{} OK, maybe you still don''t care, but economists do.)

\textcolor{gray}{($\ast$technically, we also require something called 'continuity', which also yields continuous utility and demand curves that don't have jumps,  but we won't discuss this).}

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Strictly, most results only require 'local nonsatiation'; starting from any consumption point, increasing the amount of \emph{some} good by a tiny $\epsilon$ amount will yield a preferred point. This will yield results like 'people will spend all of their wealth' and '(roughly) people will never buy a more expensive bundle when a cheaper bundle is preferred.'}

We are not saying people \emph{actually} consult a utility function.
That would be a dumb thing to say. We are considering that `people
behave as if they are maximizing utility functions'; this is (basically)
equivalent to saying "people choose based on preferences that satisfy
the above assumptions.

These axioms stand directly behind `revealed preference' methods for
measuring how much people value nonmarket goods, like clean air and
national parks. It also gives us a vocabulary and a way to test for
violations of this consistency, and make alternate predictions.

  assumption 2.}

\bigskip

Even though these concepts are rather abstract, we can already apply
this to an interesting question that has been central to economics
throughout history.

\textbf{Why is there `voluntary trade' (between individuals)?}

This gives us insight into why people trade with one another.

Considering figure 2.2 (above and in the NS text), an individual is ok
with giving up soda for hamburgers or vice/versa \emph{along} her
indifference curve. A trade that put her \emph{above} the IC makes her
`strictly' better off.

\emph{So consider if one individual had allocation D and another
allocation A, and they had the same preferences.}
\textcolor{blue}{What trade could they make to make each of them better off?}

\textcolor{gray}{Note that a straight line between these two points describes the combinations of \
'shares of bundles A and D adding up to 1' (e.g., 1/3 of D and 2/3 of A)
or \
'trading a fraction of bundle D for the same fraction of bundle A, and vice versa.'
E.g., a 50-50 split of each bundle yields, in this case, (6+2)/2 = 4 hamburgers and (2+6)/2=4 soft drinks.}

\hypertarget{marginal-rate-of-substitution-mrs-absolute-value-of-slope-of-indifference-curve}{%
\subsection{Marginal rate of substitution (MRS): Absolute value of slope
of indifference
curve}\label{marginal-rate-of-substitution-mrs-absolute-value-of-slope-of-indifference-curve}}

The MRS measures the maximum amount of one good (\(Y\)) that you would
be willing to give up in order to gain one more unit of another good
(\(X\)). I.e., this would be the amount you could give up of \(Y\) when
you gain one unit of \(X\) and be no worse or better off. You are
`indifferent' to making this change.\footnote{\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv, math: This slope will equal the negative of the *ratio* of the rate at which utility increases in each good (partial derivative).
  Intuition: giving up a certain utility from one good must be balanced by an increase in utility from the other good.
  So the MRS is the ratio itself, because it's the absolute value.) Formally, the MRS at point $X,Y$, where $U(X,Y)=U_1$ is:
  $MRS(X,Y)=-\frac{dY}{dX}|U(X,Y)=U_1$}, the absolute value of the total
  derivative of Y with respect to X, holding utility constant.}

\bigskip

\emph{Returning to fig 2.2:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Moving from A to B: She is willing to give up 2 burgers to get 1 more
  soda.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(\rightarrow\) Here the slope \(-2\), implying a \(MRS=2\)
    \footnote{Because we take the absolute value, i.e., the magnitude of
      the slope expressed as a positive number.}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  From B to C? (think about it)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1 more soda
    \(\rightarrow MRS =1\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  C to D?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(MRS = \frac{1}{2}\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

(Here this refers to `arc slopes', not precisely the slope at points
tangent to the curve.)\footnote{However, for continuous functions this
  gets closer and closer to the point slope the smaller the arc.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note the decline in the MRS as she gets more hamburgers (and fewer
  sodas): this `diminishing MRS' is a common assumption\ldots{} this may
  reflect \emph{satiation}; as she gets more and more hamburgers each
  one adds incrementally less to her utility (because she grows tired of
  them.)
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{Careful: it is very easy to get the numerator and denominator wrong in computing the MRS. Find a way to remember this for yourself.}

\hypertarget{preference-for-varietybalance}{%
\subsubsection{Preference for
variety/balance}\label{preference-for-varietybalance}}

\includegraphics[height=2.4in]{picsfigs/indifcurvebalance.png}

This `preference for variety' is thought to hold for most combinations
of goods, most of the time, but probably not for all pairings\footnote{\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: This  assumption generally makes it easier to find solutions where people consume both goods, and will imply smooth reactions to price changes.
  An extreme case is where each good is an 'absolute necessity', so as its consumption goes to zero its marginal utility goes to infinity; here people must consume some of *each* good no matter the price.}}

With an indifference curve with this shape (`convex') any consumption
bundle that represents a `mixture' between two equally attractive
extremes will be preferred to those extremes.\footnote{Economists
  pretentiously call these `convex combinations', which essentially
  means `combining a positive share of each bundle, where the shares add
  up to 1.'} E.g., if I like bundles A and D equally, I prefer a bundle
of 1/3 of A and 2/3 of D to either A or D.\footnote{How do I know the
  line connecting these points describes such mixtures? You can see by
  defining these formally and plotting this line\ldots{} in multiple
  dimensions this is a plane or `hyperplane'.\\
  More inuitively, consider that the slope of this line represents the
  slope of the difference in these bundles: `the reduction in hamburgers
  divided by the increase in soft drinks'. (Equivalently, in giving up a
  share of the upper left bundle to gain the lower right bundle, the
  number of soft drinks one gains for each hamburger sacrificed.) In
  giving up a certain share of one bundle to gain a share of the other
  bundle I am reducing my consumption of one good to gain another good
  at a \emph{constant linear} rate. Here, I need to move from 6 to 2
  hamburgers and from 2 to 6 soft drinks. The slope of this is just one
  (6-2/6-2) in this case, as seen in the dashed line.}

To get another unit of \(X\) it costs me \(P_xX\), so the more costly is
\(X\) the \emph{more} \(Y\) I must give up.

For each unit of \(Y\) I give up I save \(P_Y\), so the more costly is
\(Y\) the more I can save by giving up 1 unit of it, thus, the less I
need to sacrifice of \(Y\) to get another unit of \(X\).

\hypertarget{utility-maximization}{%
\subsection{Utility maximization}\label{utility-maximization}}

We started with an individual's preferences, one of the baseline
elements of the neoclassical model. Under some conditions these can be
described by utility functions, which we depicted graphically as
`mountains' with levels sets depicted by indifference curves.

So, we have a way of depicting what people prefer, but this doesn't tell
us what people will \emph{choose} to consume (and firms to produce).

We next introduced the second fundamental element of the neoclassical
model, constraints, in particular, the budget constraint.

We put these together to describe the consumer's problem: maximizing her
utility subject to her budget constraints. this is depicted in figure
2.7 below for the two good case.

\includegraphics[height=2.4in]{picsfigs/utilmax.png}

Imagine that you are this consumer with these preferences and this
budget constraint. You can choose any point in the shaded area, as it is
on or below your budget constraint. You want to get to the highest
indifference curve.

\textcolor{blue}{Consider:} How do we know A is suboptimal (i.e., NOT
optimal(? What about B? Points between B and C?

\bigskip

We can demonstrate that you will choose point C, yielding utility
\(U_2\).

What is special about point C?

It's the point of \emph{tangency} between the budget constraint and an
indifference \emph{curve}.

It's also (not a coincidence) the point where the slopes are equal.

\bigskip

Slope of budget constraint = slope of indifference curve
\(\rightleftarrows\)\footnote{The \(\rightleftarrow\) symbol means `if
  and only if', i.e., the object on the right-hand side implies the
  object on the left-hand side, and vice versa. In some context this
  means a `necessary and sufficient condition', but here it is just
  basically a definition.}

\[P_X/P_Y = MRS\]

\emph{Note} that both slopes are negative, so both negative signs cancel
out, leaving this condition.

\textcolor{red}{Warning:} The above is shorthand; recall that the
marginal rate of substitution may vary everywhere along an indifference
curve (remember the idea of satiation and diminishing MRS). It is a
function of the \emph{point} it is evaluated, i.e., \(MRS = MRS(X,Y)\).
It is only at the \emph{point where the consumer is optimizing} that
these slopes must be equal.\footnote{They can also be equal at some
  other suboptimal points, where she is not spending all of her income,
  or if the indifference curves have a shape very different from the one
  above (more or less, where they are not `convex'). Where she is
  consuming some of every good, this is a \emph{necessary} condition for
  such a point to represent an optimal consumption choice, but it may
  not be a sufficient condition. May also be optimal for her to consume
  \emph{none} of certain goods, in which case this condition will not
  hold. We return to this later.}

  Consume all of income (locate \emph{on} budget line; follows from
  `more is better')
\item

\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Intuition: If I can give up X for Y in the market (buy less X, get more
Y) at a certain rate, and the \emph{benefit} I get from doing this is at
a different rate, I can make myself better off.

Thus the original point could not have been optimal!

\includegraphics[height=.7in]{picsfigs/glasses.png}

\emph{Think about this carefully; it is a key method of proving things
in economic theory called `proof by contradiction'.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{Example, for intuition}

Suppose that at the consumption bundle you choose your MRS = 1. To
remain indifferent, you would be willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1
soda.

Suppose the price of soda is £1 and the price of a burger is £2.
\(\rightarrow\) Price ratio: \(P_S/P_B = 1/2\)

Thus if you buy one less burger you can buy two more sodas. Thus if you
give up one burger, you can get one more soda to keep you indifferent
\emph{plus} an additional soda. This means you would be better off; thus
the original bundle \emph{wasn't} optimal.

\textcolor{blue}{Practice question: in which direction would you adjust this bundle if the price of a soda was £2 and a hamburger was £1? Explain.}

\hypertarget{more-insight-skip-if-you-like}{%
\subsubsection{More insight: Skip if you
like}\label{more-insight-skip-if-you-like}}

This next bit is fairly mathy. It should be helpful but you can skip
over it if you don't find it so.

Recall \(U=U(X,Y)\).

\[U_X(X,Y) := MU_X(X,Y)\]

\medskip

\emph{Derivative with respect to X: rate that utility increases if we
add a little X, holding Y constant}

Similarly for \(MU_Y\).

\bigskip

It turns out the MRS at a point is the ratio of these marginal
utilities.

MRS: `how much Y would I be willing to give up to get a unit of X'?

\bigskip

Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each \ldots{} we can show
\(MRS(X,Y)=\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\)

\emph{Note:} The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point --
the higher is \(MU_X\) -- the more Y I am willing to give up to get it.
That is why \(MU_X\) is in the numerator.

The more valuable a bit more Y is at that point -- the higher is
\(MU_Y\) -- the less Y I am willing to give up to get a bit more X. That
is why \(MU_Y\) is in the denominator.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Advanced maths: The derivation of the MRS is optional material.}

The `first order change in utility' (or `total differential') is:

\[ dU  = \frac{\partial U}{\partial X}dX + \frac{\partial U}{\partial Y}dY\]
\[ = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Where \(\frac{\partial U}{\partial X}\) refers to the partial
  derivative of U(X,Y) with respect to X, and similarly for Y, i.e., the
  marginal utility.
\end{itemize}

Essentially, this approximates the total change in utility for very
small changes in X and Y. Setting it equal to zero and rearranging it
yields the rate, at the margin, one is willing to give up Y for X:

\[dU  = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY = 0 \]

\[\frac{dY}{dX}=-\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\]

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: This is a simple case of the implicit function theorem, essentially $U(X,Y)=c$ defines an implicit function $Y(X)$, whose slope is the negative of the ratio of the derivatives.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields more intuition:

\[P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y\]

(at each consumption point X,Y)

\[\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}.\]

\bigskip

I.e., the same `bang for each buck'.

\emph{Note:} If this didn't hold true and you were spending on both
goods, you would be paying `more per util' for one good than the other,
and thus should reallocate to that other good.

Suppose tickets are rationed: one per customer.

This constraint (which is \emph{additional} to the budget constraint)
implies lower utility; the individual depicted above would choose A if
unconstrained.

Here the budget line is not tangent to indifference curve; the slopes
are not equal. The individual would be better off buying more tickets,
but she cannot.

She would be willing to buy an additional ticket at full price (move to
point C). Actually, she would be willing to pay \emph{more} than full
price for a second ticket.
\textcolor{gray}{(See previous final exams and textbook questions asking, e.g., 'how much would she be willing to pay?'}

She could give up up to an additional C-D of goods for ticket 2 and
still be as well off.

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv: Tough questions (final exam-worthy):} Why

\subsubsection{Perfect substitutes, but not

\textcolor{red}{Warning:} Thinking caps on. This may be confusing.

Consider: are the following `perfect substitutes' for someone who wants
caffeine, but has no taste buds?

\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{picsfigs/amount-of-caffeine-in-drinks.jpg}

Yes, they are!

Recall the \protect\hyperlink{perfect-sub-comp}{definition of perfect
substitutes}.

By `perfect substitutes' we mean pairs of goods for which \emph{some
amount} of one is always valued the same as \emph{some amount} of the
other, and this proportion is always the same.

An easy example: I might always be indifferent between three pints of
mild ale and two pints of strong ale, if they have the same total
alcohol content and I only want to get tipsy.

So (for perfect substitutes) buy the one that increases it more
\emph{per-\pounds.}

\textcolor{red}{Warning:} On the other hand, if goods are \emph{not}
perfect substitutes, margunal utility ratios (thus, marginal rates of
substitution) generally depend on consumption levels.

\bigskip

Numerical example:\\

\[U(X,Y)=4X+3Y\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rate at which each good (X and Y) increases utility per-unit
  (derivative) is constant

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(MU_X = 4\), so every additional unit of X will add four units of
    utility in this example, no matter what the starting point is.
  \item
    \(MU_Y = 3\), \ldots{} so every unit of Y will add 3 units\ldots{}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  So \textcolor{red}{(for perfect substitutes)} the consumer will buy
  the one that increases utility more \emph{per-£}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Compare \(MU_X/P_X\) to \(MU_Y/P_Y\)
  \item
    Here, if \(4/P_X > 3/P_Y\), then buy X.
  \item
    if \(4/P_X < 3/P_Y\), then buy Y

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      (if equal, buy either)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Rearranging, if \(P_X < 4/3 P_Y\), buy X \ldots{} etc.

\textcolor{gray}{AKA 'Leontief preferences'}

\[U(X,Y)=min(2X,Y)\]

E.g., where X is bicycle frames and Y bicycle wheels.
\textcolor{red}{Warning:} this min function seems backwards, but it's
correct. I've answered this question many times in office hours and on
the forum (have a look). No one believes me at first but in the end they
realize that this is the case.

However, I will not ask you specifically to get this `min' functional
form for perfect complements on an exam.

You should be able to do this without having taken economics. Suppose
you were given £100 and asked to spend it to make as many
sausages-with-baps as possible. No one can eat a sausage without a bap,
nor vice-versa. Sausages come in packs of 4, and baps come in packs of
8.

£1 each?

\hypertarget{middle-ground}{%
\subsubsection{Middle-ground}\label{middle-ground}}

A Cobb-Douglas \textbf{example}

Recall, as I noted above, that for the ``general'' rather than extreme
cases the marginal rate of substitution at a particular point may vary
everywhere, and depends on the amount of each good consumed. Below the
``Cobb-Douglas'' functional form is one example of such a `middle
ground' utility function, expressing neither perfect substitutes and are
perfect complements. A simple case of this Cobb-Douglas utility
is:\footnote{The General Cobb-Douglas function is : \(U(X,Y)=X^a Y^b\)
  where a and b arepositive constants.}

\[ U(X,Y)=\sqrt(XY) \]

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv note}, may help save you
computations:\footnote{We are `allowed' to square the whole thing to
  simplify the problem. Why? Utility is only ``identified up to a
  monotonic transformation''. In general you can transform the utility
  function in any way that preserves the ordering of preferences over
  the combinations of X and Y. (E.g., multiply/divide it by any positive
  amount, add any constant, take it to any power, put it into an
  exponential or large transformation\ldots{} Doing this, replacing
  utility function with this ``new'' utility function will have no
  impact on the choices the person makes. The only thing that will
  change is the realized level utility, which is not a meaningful
  concept. However, this will no longer hold later in the module when we
  talk about uncertainty and expected utility.}

\emph{Amount of Y you'd give up to get a unit of X:}

\[MRS(X,Y)= MU_X/MU_Y = Y/X\]

Note: The last equality comes from this \emph{particular} function; it
is not always Y/X.

Note also that this is the same as 'the amount of Y you'd need to give
up a unit of X

\bigskip

Checking your work: is this solution reasonable?

The more Y I have, the more I am willing to give up to get a unit of X.
This seems reasonable, as it reflects satiation.

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv, maths: This slope is derived through calculus. }\footnote{\(MU_X\)
  is the slope of \(U(X,Y)\) in X at a particular point, i.e., the
  (partial) derivative with respect to X
  \(MU_X = \frac{\partial}{\partial X} (XY)^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} (XY)^{-1/2}Y = \frac{1}{2} (Y/X)^{1/2}\)
  Similarly, \(MU_Y = \frac{1}{2}(X/Y)^{1/2}\).}

In general, the marginal rate of substitution (at a point) is the ratio
of the marginal utilities at that point.\footnote{This is helpful and
  intuitive, but I am not requiring you to remember this, although it
  may help you do your calculations.}

Here\footnote{I say `here' both because the MRS comes specifically from
  this Cobb-Douglas utility function. Also, because we now have nice
  convex indifference curves with `normal' slopes, unlike for perfect
  complements or substitutes. The more of one good you have the less you
  value it relative to the other good (unlike perfect substitutes) but
  you still value more of it somewhat (unlike for perfect complements)}
(for this Cobb-Douglas), utility-maximization requires, at optimal
choices of X and Y:

\[MRS(X,Y)= Y/X = P_X/P_Y\]

Check that it makes sense:

As \(P_X\) increases, the right-hand-side (RHS) increases, and so to
increase the left-hand-side (LHS) I must increase the units of Y
consumed, and thus decrease the units of X consumed. Thus as \(P_X\)
increases I consume more units of X and less Y, which is what you might
expect for a standard case.

\bigskip

For any price ratio, you can find the ratio of units of Y \& X consumed.
Then, if you know the prices and total income \(I\), you can calculate
the consumption and spending on X and Y

\bigskip

Rearranging the optimization condition:

\[Y P_Y = X P_X\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textcolor{blue}{Question (adv.:} What is weird about this condition,
  for this example?\footnote{You always spend the same \emph{amount} on
    each good, no matter the price (Note, that doesn't mean the same
    number of units). This `constant expenditure shares' are a
    characteristic of Cobb-Douglas functions that limit their usefulness
    and realism. But we still use them all the time in teaching.}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Combining this with the budget constraint

\[P_X X + P_Y Y = I\]

we can now solve for amounts of X and Y purchased, as functions of
prices and income.

\emph{Calculations:} Rearranging the optimization condition,
\(Y = X P_X/P_Y\).\\

\smallskip

From the budget constraint, \(X = (I - P_Y Y)/P_X\).\\

\smallskip

Substituting in for Y yields
\(X = (I - P_Y(X P_X / P_Y))/P_X = I/P_X - X\) \o

\smallskip

\(\rightarrow 2X = I/P_X \rightarrow X = I/(2P_X)\)\\
\(X P_X = I / 2 \rightarrow\) this person always spends half her income
on X.\footnote{To repeat, this is not a general result, it is a result
  coming from this particular version of the Cobb-Douglas utility
  function. Obviously, Economics does not predict that everyone spent
  equal shares of their income on each good!}

\medskip

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Advanced shortcut tip:}\footnote{You can solve for
  the optimal \(Y\) by `symmetry': as utility and budget constraint are
  symmetric everything we said holds replacing X with Y.\\
  Thus \(Y = I/(2P_Y)\) etc.}

Previously, we considered how consumption choices determined by utility
functions/indifference curves and budget constraints. We can now
consider how an individual's choice of a good varies with each element
of her budget constraint: for income and the price of each good.

We will refer to her `quantity demanded of good X' function (or more
simply, her `demand function') as follows:

\bigskip

\[Quantity \: of \: X \: demanded = d_x(P_X, P_Y, I; preferences)\]

\item[Homogenous (of degree zero) (demand) function]
A function whose outcome value does not change when \emph{all} arguments
are changed \emph{proportionally} is \emph{homogenous of degree zero}
\end{description}

\bigskip

\(d_X(P_X,P_Y,I)\) is homogenous of degree zero in its arguments.

\bigskip

Multiply all prices and income by the same amount, and the \emph{budget
constraint is unchanged.} Thus ( as preferences have not changed)
consumption choices should not change either.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  E.g., the budget constraint \(P_X X + P_Y Y = I\) is the same as the
  budget constraint \(2P_X X + 2P_Y Y = 2I\)
\end{itemize}

\emph{Intuition for this:} Graphically, the budget line and indifference
curves are unchanged, so her optimization problem is identical to the
optimization problem before. The point of tangency between an
indifference curve and her budget line is the same as before.

Consider, if your income, as well as prices, were stated in pennies
rather than pounds (e.g., 5 million pennies rather than £50,000), would
your choices change?\footnote{Of course not! At least they `should' not
  change; your optimal choices would not change. Perhaps in some
  specific context the way the problem is framed may affect people's
  choices, but that is not what is being asked here. Furthermore, we are
  considering `normative' economics in the sense of `what would rational
  optimizing agents do'?}

Q: What happens to the quantity purchased of some good as your income
increases?

A: Depends on whether the good is normal or inferior.

(Whether it is normal or inferior depends on your preferences and the
change in the slope of the indifference curves with higher
income/utility, as we see below.)

\bigskip

\begin{description}

\emph{Consider:} Here we see more income \(\rightarrow\) less
expenditure on Z! (Not just `a lesser share' but actually \emph{less}.)

This is because the \emph{shape} of the indifference curves changes at
higher incomes in this example. When people have a lot to spend, they
want to spend it on Y and not on Z. (Again \emph{in this example}, not
in general.) Consider, if you won the lottery how much pot noodle would
you buy? Pot noodle may be like good Z in this example.

\emph{Notes:} Adv: To be precise, this is \emph{not} about wealthy
people being different than poor people nor that their taste `changes'
when they become wealthy. We are considering the same person with higher
income, and thus the potential to choose a different bundle of goods.
Empirically, these are hard to distinguish, however.

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv:}

\textcolor{blue}{Consider: all goods cannot be inferior. Why not?}\footnote{There
  are `adding up' conditions. You always spend all of your income. Thus,
  if as your income increases, you spend less on some subset of goods,
  you \emph{must} spend more on the remaining goods.}

What happens to the quantity purchased of some good when the price of
the good falls or rises?

\emph{This changes both an intercept and a slope.}\\

The new utility-maximizing choice is on \emph{another} indifference
curve and it is a point on that curve with a different MRS.

\tightlist
\item[Income effect (of a price change)]
The remaining effect on consumption; due to the change in purchasing
power and achievable utility caused by a change in price.
\end{description}

Note that this is \emph{conceptual}: we never \emph{actually} observe
either of these effects alone; we always observe the net effect of both.

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Advanced footnote}\footnote{This standard
  definition of the `income effect' of a price change combines both of
  the effects we saw when looking at the impact of an income change on
  consumption of X. More consumption of each good is possible, but the
  MRS may differ at this higher consumption and utility level.}

  nuanced and complicated than we will cover in the main content of this
  module.\\
  To fully cover this, we would have to consider the theoretical concept
  of a `compensated' aka `Hicksian' demand curve,\\
  where income is adjusted to hold utility constant while price ratios
  change.\\
  This also allows us to consider `net versus gross' substitution, and
  `equivalent vs compensating variation'.\\
  More advanced economics modules will cover this extensively and

Some things to remember and `remember why':

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \underline{substitution effect} \emph{always} goes in the opposite
  direction as the price change
\item
  The \underline{income effect} goes in the opposite direction as the
  price change for a normal good
\item
  \ldots{} But the income effect goes in the \emph{same} direction as
  the price change for an inferior good

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Thus the substitution and income effects go in the same direction
    for a normal good,
  \item
    \ldots{} and they go in different directions for an inferior good.
  \item
    For an inferior good the net effect is unknown, but usually the
    substitution effect dominates (but see Giffen goods below)

function, i.e., on the curvature of the indifference curves at the
relevant point.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Perfect complements: There is no substitution effect, only an income
  effect of a price change.
\item
  Perfect substitutes: There may be a large substitution effect -- a
  price change may cause a complete switch from one good (or set of
  goods) to another. On the other hand there may be no substitution
  effect for a `small' change in price\ldots{} see examples.
\item
  In-between utility functions: depends on curvature of indifference

\hypertarget{app-3.2-the-cpi-and-its-biases}{%
\subsection{App 3.2: The CPI and its
biases}\label{app-3.2-the-cpi-and-its-biases}}

The government (and many others) want to know `how much less (or more)
is a pound this year than a pound in the past?' One of the most
prominent measures of this is the ``consumer price index (CPI).''

The is a \emph{very} important number: It is used for monetary policy
(`inflation targeting') and for targeting many salaries and benefits.
For example, my union is always raising the complaint that salaries have
not risen in line with inflation. (But don't worry, student fees have.)

Getting this number substantially and consistently wrong can lead to
huge problems; people may be let into poverty or the government may be
led into default. However, it is hard to get this measure right. Using
the classical economics framework, we can consider what this means.

The UK uses a similar CPI measure to the USA (a change from the `RPI' in
2003, although RPI is still used for some things). The Bank of England
targets a 2\% increase in the CPI per year.\^{}{[}Something to know:
what has been the inflation rate in recent years? This is an example of
`market and industry knowledge' that employers value. True, you can look
this stuff up, but having a general sense of these things rolling around
in your brain will ground your thinking. As an analogy, suppose you were
a mariner navigating the seven seas and you had to go online every time
to remember which direction was North or South.\}

\emph{But does the CPI overstate the rate of inflation?}

It is based on a `typical market basket' (UK: of 700 different goods and
services, excluding housing, updated yearly).

\textbf{1982 vs 2019 two-good example}

We can consider this with a minimal example, using only our two
favourite goods, x and y.

Suppose in 1982 the ``average household'' consumed \(x_{82}\) units of
good x and \(y_{82}\) units of good y. The prices were \(p^x_{82}\) and
\(p^y_{82}\) for each of these, respectively.

Now in 2019 the average household consume \(x_{19}\) units of good x and
\(y_{19}\) units of good y. The prices are \(p^x_{19}\) and \(p^y_{18}\)
for each of these, respectively.

The expenditure (in pounds) in 1982 was thus \(b_{82}\):

\[b_{82}=p^x_{82}x_{82}+p^y_{82}y_{82}\]

How much would it cost to consume the ``average 1982'' basket today
(2019), with today's prices? \ldots{} This is defined as \(b_{19}\):

\[b_{19}=p^x_{19}x_{82}+p^y_{19}y_{82}\]

The ``regular'' CPI will simply take the ratio of these two numbers:

\[cpi_{19}=\frac{b_{19}}{b_{82}}\]

An unadjusted (Fixed-basket) CPI `claims' you need \(I'\) to be as well
off in 2019. I.e., to buy \emph{the exact same basket}, including vinyl
records.~But, as seen in the figure below, by substituting you could be
as well off with the lower level of income \(I''\)~(And income \(I'\)
would actually make you \emph{better} off).

\includegraphics[height=2.7in]{picsfigs/cpi_bias.png}

\bigskip

In fact, in setting policy, the basket \emph{is} adjusted yearly, based
on a survey of consumers' spending.~But even this is not necessarily the
\emph{right} adjustment,~as consumers may be attaining higher or lower
utility from these changes.~The right adjustment depends on the
consumers' utility functions, which are unobservable.

Consider the `least efficient tax': Suppose the UK government imposes a
tax on all windows above 4 per house.\\

\emph{Suppose all UK residents put bricks over their excess windows.}
The government raises no revenue but people are certainly worse off.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

What's going on here?

\includegraphics[height=2.6in]{picsfigs/tudoroverhang.jpg}

\footnote{Note: `Taxes based on ground-floor area' are mentioned
  throughout the web, but I couldn't find an authoritative reference to
  this. If anyone finds one, please let me know!}

The social cost (deadweight loss, i.e., `DWL') of taxation is greater
the more taxes change `compensated' behaviour (via the substitution
effect)\footnote{Why `compensated' behavior? Essentially, because taxes
  in general will always leave people with less effective income,
  causing them to change their consumption choices to reflect the new,
  lower indifference curves. What matters for the deadweight loss is how
  the taxes change their behavior at this new lower-income state. This
  is a fundamental issue in Public Finance/taxation.}

The most efficient tax:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  raises the most revenue for a given utility loss
\item
  reduces utility the least for a given revenue
\item
  \ldots{} is a `lump-sum tax': same tax no matter what you do
  (including work/leisure!)
\end{itemize}

This is a rationale for the poll tax, the proposed tax that brought down
Margaret Thatcher's government

A common measure of the burden: `amount a person would be willing to pay
to avoid tax', for a given revenue raised

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\includegraphics[height=2.8in]{picsfigs/lumpsum1.png}

*A step-by-step illustration of this is given in the
\href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/qhsl6qey0wjcfe5/utility_demand_supplement.pptx?dl=0}{PowerPoint
file} under `Lump sum principle'.

Key to understanding the above example illustration: how do we see that
the blue and red dot both \emph{raise the same revenue}?

You could also compute these tax revenues algebraically and see they are
the same (see footnote in NS textbook), but it is better to gain
intuitive insight.

The revenue can be seen as the distance on the vertical axis,
representing the value in terms of Y at the pre-tax price ratio.

This holds whether we measure it in terms of either commodity -- you
just have to pick one.

The tax revenue is the difference between the individual's income and
the amount he consumes; both measured in terms of one commodity only,
according to the \emph{actual opportunity cost} of that commodity, not
measured with the `after tax price'.

Note\ldots{}\footnote{This illustration is a single example; to see that
  this holds generally, take Public Economics. There are some
  interesting and surprising results. A caveat: If you \emph{can't} tax
  one good (e.g., leisure)\\
  you \emph{don't} want to tax all other goods equally.\\
  In general, you want to tax goods that distort behaviour less overall.}

\textcolor{gray}{Note:  In the previous 2-good diagrams the impact of the change in $P_X$ on $Y$ was mechanical.
With a new budget constraint and a new $X$ $\rightarrow$, the individual needed to spend the remainder on $Y$. If expenditure on one good went up, expenditure on the other good must have gone down, and vice/versa.  With 3 or more goods, this need not hold.}

\begin{description}

\item[Complements]
If a rise in \(P_X\) leads the quantity demanded of Y, \(d_Y\), to
decrease (and vice-versa), then goods Y and X are (gross)
\emph{complements} to one another.
\end{description}

\emph{How to remember:} `complements' go together, so the
quantity-demanded response to a price change is the same for both goods
-- the opposite direction as the price change (unless Giffen).

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Substitutes]
If a rise in \(P_X\) leads \(d_Y\) to increase (and vice versa), then

A tip on how to remember this:

`Substitutes' are competing to meet the same desires, so when you buy
more of one, you tend to buy less of the other.\\
Thus the quantity demanded response to a price change go in opposite
directions for the two goods\\
Thus, as quantity-demanded for good A typically goes in the
\emph{opposite} direction as the price of A\\
\ldots{} quantity demanded for a substitute good B will go in the
\emph{same} direction as the price of A.\footnote{\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv:}
  These `cross-price effects' include both \emph{substitution} and
  \emph{income} effects. (See micro quiz 3.3).}

to add more space despite retail sales `moving backwards'}

\begin{quote}
The retailer does not expect any impact from the drop in sterling since
the Brexit vote to kick in until at least the Spring of 2017, as it had
hedged some of its foreign-currency exposures in advance. Still, it
expects expenses to rise by up to 5 per cent next year. `The last time
we had to increase prices (which was in 2010 when cotton prices soared)
we estimated that price elasticity was around 1.1. If that remains the
case today, a retail selling price increase of 5\% would result in a
fall in unit sales of -5.5\% and a fall in like for like sales value of
between -0.5\% to -1.0\%. In the scheme of things, we think that this
drag on sales is manageable and less damaging than taking a significant
hit to margin.'

Properties of price elasticity of demand:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Goods with many close substitutes at a similar price will be highly
  elastic
\item
  \ldots{} with few substitutes \ldots{} inelastic
\item
  Typically: more elastic in the \emph{long run} than the short run.
  \textcolor{blue}{Q : why?}\footnote{Ans: Over time, consumers can
    adjust to price changes by changing their consumption patterns.
    E.g., if petrol gets more expensive I can switch to a hybrid or
    electric car, or a bicycle.}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

We refer to price elasticities with the following terminology:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\(e_{Q,p}\) & \(abs(e_{Q,p})\) & Term\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\(< -1\) & \(>1\) & Elastic\tabularnewline
\(= -1\) & \(=1\) & Unit Elastic\tabularnewline
\(> -1\) & \(<1\) & Inelastic\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textcolor{gray}{Note that sometimes elasticities are expressed in absolute value terms (a positive number). It should be clear from the context.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Consider an individual's expenditure on a product.

The total expenditure (the firm's revenue from this): price \(\times\)
quantity

By taking the \emph{total differential} of this (you don't need to), and
recalling the `multiplication rule' of derivatives\ldots{}

We have that for \emph{small changes} in price, the percent
\emph{change} in total expenditure is:

\begin{verbatim}
- pct change price $+$ pct *change* quantity
\end{verbatim}

As \(e_{Q,P}\) tells you the percent change in quantity for each (small)
percentage change in price, we can use this to determine the change in
expenditure for a small change in price.

\emph{Considering very small increases in a good's price:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the (individual's) demand is \emph{price-elastic}, quantity will
  decrease by a \emph{larger} percentage than price increased. Thus her
  expenditure (on this good) will \emph{decline}.
\item
  If the (individual's) demand is \emph{price-inelastic}, quantity will
  decrease by a \emph{smaller} percentage than price increased. Thus her
  expenditure (on this good) will \emph{increase }.
\item
  If the (individual's) demand is \emph{unit-elastic} (with respect to
  price), quantity will decrease by a \emph{the same} percentage as
  price increased. Thus her expenditure (on this good) will \emph{be
  unchanged}.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\hypertarget{example-and-slightly-more-advanced-algebra}{%
\paragraph{Example and (slightly more advanced)
algebra\ldots{}}\label{example-and-slightly-more-advanced-algebra}}

If price rises by 20\% and quantity demanded falls by 20\% what happens
to revenue? Suppose p=10 and q=10 so TR=100. Then when p=12 and q=8
TR=96. Huh? Price increased by 20\% and quantity decreased by 20\% so
shouldn't TR be unchanged? No! This only works for small changes.

TR is unchanged when p*q stays the same. With a change in each
\(\delta p\) and \(\delta q\), the new revenue is

\((p+\delta p)(q+\delta q) = pq+\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q\).

This is the same as before if
\(pq=pq+\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q\), i.e., if

\(\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q=0\), i.e., if

\(\delta p q + \delta p \delta q =-\delta q p\), i.e., if

\(\delta p q/p + \delta p \delta q/p =-\delta q\), i.e., if

\(\delta p/ \delta q (q/p) + \delta p /p =-1\), i.e., if

\(-e_p + \delta p /p = -1\)

In the limit, as \(\delta p\) goes to zero, this gives us that `unit
elasticity means a small change in quantity leads to no change in
revenue.'

\textcolor{blue}{Q: Suppose a firm is setting its price and selling to only one individual , and facing no  competitors. It should basically never want to set its price at a point where demand is inelastic. Why not?}\footnote{Ans:
  If it were at such a point, it could raise its price and its revenue
  would increase and costs would decline\\
  (because it would be selling fewer products but for greater total
  revenue.)\\
  A caveat is that it might do this for a long term strategic advantage;
  e.g., to gain customer loyalty and market share, intending to take its
  profits later. we come back to a related point later in the context of
  monopoly pricing.}

\begin{quote}
Sir, Professor Gordon Gemmill (Letters, December 14), surprisingly for a
trained economist, assumes an income elasticity of demand of zero for
housing: that is, that people do not demand more and better housing as
they become richer. Nowhere in the world is this the case! My own
empirical work demonstrates that around two-thirds of the rise in UK
house prices, corrected for general inflation, since 1980 is because
supply is not keeping up with income and population growth. Other
drivers do exist \ldots{} The price effects of extra supply take time to
build up. I agree on that. But just imagine what would happen if we did
nothing more than we are now doing: population and income growth would
drive prices even higher even though we already hold the record for
rises in house prices since 1970 among the group of seven leading
high-income countries. We need to build far more housing, in the right
locations. And we need to start now. - Prof John Muellbauer Nuffield

\textcolor{red}{This year} we only briefly cover the production
function, inputs, and the firm's cost structure.

\bigskip

Key issues are highlighted on the next slides, and in the handouts.

I'm giving you the `basic idea' so we can continue the \emph{story.}

\bigskip

\item
  Production function (basic idea; you can skip isoquant maps and RTS if
  you like)
\item
  Returns to scale (!)
\item
  Basic cost concepts (!)
\item

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{the-firms-production-function}{%
\subsection{The Firm's Production
function}\label{the-firms-production-function}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A production function is a mathematical relationship between inputs
  (capital, labour, materials, etc.) and outputs.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\[q = f( K, L, M, ...)\]

\[q = f(K, L)\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  e.g., \(q =2L^{1/3}K^{2/3}\)
\item
  Given its production choice, the firm tries to produce it at the
  minimum cost

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This resembles a consumer maximizing utility subject to budget
    constraints\footnote{A major difference: a firm \emph{also} chooses
      the \emph{level} of output, while the consumer has a fixed budget
      constraint \ldots{} we return to the firm in later sections.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Typically, a particular quantity (\(q\)) could be produced with several
different combinations of inputs.

\emph{Which combination will the firm choose?}

\[q = f(k,l,...)\]

\textbf{Main point}: Whatever \(q\) it wants to produce, the firm uses
the \emph{minimum cost combination of inputs}!

It chooses inputs to get the best `bang for the buck';

\(\rightarrow\) where the input mix is optimal, each input yields the
same *marginal product per \pounds*

\bigskip

\textcolor{gray}{This is very similar to the consumer optimization we discussed. For a given total input cost, the firm wants to produce as much as possible. A better way of thinking about this is that for a given production, the firm wants to incur as low a cost as possible. However, there is no 'hard budget constraint' as in the consumer optimisation case. The firm's output choice will be chosen to maximise it's profit, with no constraints other than 'non-negativity. }

\textcolor{gray}{ I'm not expecting you to know this input-choice optimisation in detail. I just wanted you to have a general sense of it as it helps us see how the model fits together.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Optimisation (given a production function and input prices)\ldots{}

yields a (minimum) cost for every output \(q\) a firm chooses to produce

\bigskip

Total cost function: \(c(q)\) or \(TC(q)\).

\textbf{Total costs} are fixed costs plus variable costs

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Fixed costs:} must incur to produce even the first unit (e.g.,
  hire factory space)
\item
  \textbf{Variable costs:} increase as one produces more units
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{Marginal cost} \(MC(q)=c'(q)\): rate that costs increase in
quantity; derivative of cost function

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  cost of producing one additional unit (given you already produced q
  units)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{IRS}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fixed costs (incorporation, buildings, management, planning, R\&D)
  spread over more units
\item
  Should always be able to at least `double everything' and produce
  twice as much? (so at least CRS)
\item
  Scale allows specialisation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{DRS}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Limited resources in whole (or local) economy; costs begin to rise
\item
  Managerial issues and coordination problems, bigger `centre' to lobby
  for favours

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    (See `theories of the firm')
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Harder to give incentives to top manager/CEO?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Larger firm \(\rightarrow\) harder to make CEO liable for losses
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Adv: I think the first point is valid, but it doesn't suggest that 2
firms would be more efficient than 1; these DRS would set in as a
function of \emph{total} output, not a single firm's output. The second
and third arguments are complicated and perhaps harder to justify. The
case for DRS is unproven, IMHO

NOTE: See example in table 1 in text

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Single price (assume) \(\rightarrow\) sell more only by reducing price
  on \emph{all units}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    E.g., sell 51 units rather than 50 by reducing price from £1 to
    £0.99
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Marginal revenue is less than market price here \emph{because}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Get (new) market price for additional unit \(\rightarrow\) + £0.99
  \item
    But lose £0.01 on all previous 50 units \(\rightarrow\) - £0.50
  \item
    So MR is £0.49

\includegraphics[height=4in]{picsfigs/mrcurve.png}

\textcolor{blue}{Q: Why might MR curves typically decrease in Q?}

Ans: Demand curves slope down, so less revenue for each additional
unit.\\
Also, the \emph{impact} of the reduced price is greater because the more
we sell the more units this affects

\subsubsection{MR for a price-taking
firm}\label{mr-for-a-price-taking-firm}}

A price-taking firm (perfect competition):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  gets market price P for each additional unit
\item
  the firm is small, so its output has (virtually) no impact on P

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    (More on this later)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

NOTE: The text gives a good illustration and examples of why it is fine
to assume that\\
a small producer's output has no impact on price

\bigskip

\emph{Thus its marginal revenue is constant at \(P\)}

\emph{NOTE:} Total revenue curve will be a straight line \ldots{} double
quantity, double revenue

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If operating, set optimal output \(q^*\)
\item
  Under standard assumed conditions
\end{itemize}

\emph{Notes:} Conditions for a `unique maximum', e.g.~everywhere
decreasing marginal revenue and increasing or nondecreasing marginal
costs

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \ldots{} profits are maximised at the unique \(q^*\) such that
  \(MR=MC\)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

This holds \emph{for all types of firms}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For firms with market power (`price-setters') the MR takes into
  account the downward sloping demand curve.
\item
  For a price-taker, setting \(MR(q)=MC(q)\) means setting \(P=MC(q)\),
  because \(P=MR(q)\)
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{blue}{Q:  Why? Suppose actual output was greater or less than q*.}
Explain what is true about marginal profits as output increases or
decreases.

\emph{Notes:} Ans: if q\textgreater q*, MR, which is decreasing in q,
will be below MC. Firm can do better if it reduces q somewhat-- cost
decrease will be larger than revenue decrease. If \(q<q^{\ast}\),
\(MR<MC\) -- better to increase q and revenue increases more than costs

\textbf{For a firm with market power:}

\includegraphics[height=7.8in]{picsfigs/fig8-1.png}

Firm wants to make the vertical distance between the revenue and cost
curves as large as possible.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{For a firm with market power:}

\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{picsfigs/monopmcmr.png}

Firm wants to make the vertical distance between the revenue and cost
curves as large as possible.\\
If the curves had differing slopes, profits could be increased by
adjusting output in the direction in which the curves diverged.

intuition}\label{inverse-elasticity-markup-rule-intuition}}

(Advanced material)

Price elasticity of demand for single firm's output (q):

\(e_{q,p}\) = abs(\% change in q) / (\% change in P))

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\includegraphics[height=2.1in]{picsfigs/elast_vs_mr.png}

\bigskip

Rearranging the MR (derivative of revenue wrt price) yields:

\[MR= P(1-\frac{1}{e_{q,p}})\]

Intuition: Sell another unit, gain `P' on that unit but lose `P
\(\times\) \% reduction in P needed for a \% increase in Q' on other
units the last term is the inverse of price elasticity

\[MR= P(1-\frac{1}{e_{q,p}})\]

Setting MR=MC \(\rightarrow\) `markup as \% of price'
\(\frac{P-MC}{P}=\frac{1}{e_{q,p}}\)

\emph{(You don't have to memorise this formula)}

\begin{itemize}

\hypertarget{motivating-questions}{%
\subsubsection{Motivating questions}\label{motivating-questions}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  With many `price taking firms', how does \emph{aggregate} supply
  respond to changes in demand?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Can such firms make a profit in the short run? In the long run?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If demand for a good increases (demand curve shifts out), because
  preferences change, or population increase

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \ldots{} should we expect the price of the good to rise in the short
    or long run?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{Deeper:}

Should we expect `competition' to lead to the most efficient outcomes,
and if so, when and under what conditions?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Would it be better to restrict the entry of firms, or have a single
  firm with a guaranteed monopoly?
\item
  Would it be better to restrict or regulate prices?
\end{itemize}

These questions are at the core of political and economic debates
throughout the 19th and 20th century. Mercantilists vs physiocrats
(classical liberals), Socialists vs laissez-faire debates over
`industrial policy' and `trust-busting', etc

Trade with Europe may default to WTO terms

\(\rightarrow\) Very large tariffs on some goods, `non-tariff barriers'
on others

\bigskip

UK (and EU) firms: Unknown impact on input prices, demand curves,

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Can `GE models' help predict these and help firms plan and reoptimise?
\item
  How long will it take to return to some `equilibrium'

\begin{itemize}

  Fewer firms in UK markets \(\rightarrow\) less competition

  Which are `pro-competitive' or redress market failures and which

\textcolor{gray}{You should have all seen this before in previous study, so we will go quickly}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Number of firms in the market is fixed: no entry/exit
\item
  Existing firms will respond to demand shifts by changing their
  quantity supplied
\item
  Market supply curve: sum of each firm's supply curve
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Recall (from earlier study): Under perfect competition each firm

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  must charge market price \(P^*\)
\item
  produces q so that \(mc(q)=P^*\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    as long as there is some output q where \(AVC \leq P*\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Thus, for every price \(P^{*}\), it produces the \(q\) where
\(mc(q)=P^{*}\).

\bigskip

This implies that its mc curve \emph{is} its supply curve!\\

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  (except where \(AVC(q)>P^*\) for all q; where it produces zero)
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} Where the minimum AVC exceeds P*, the firm has no way to
produce profitably, so it will produce nothing.

\emph{Note}:
\textcolor{gray}{slide 19 states 'The firm considers its sunk costs when deciding to exit, but ignores them when deciding whether to shut down.' This is not stated precisely. They are referring to those 'fixed costs' which must be incurred at regular intervals (e.g., a license fee every year)... from the pov of midyear, this years' license fee is sunk, but next year's is not.}

  Sum individual demand curves to get \emph{market} demand curve
\item
  At what point do these intersect?

    run.)
  \end{itemize}

To avoid confusion, recall that firms are producing where their
\emph{marginal} costs equal the market price.\\
MC are often assumed to \emph{increase} as quantity increases; this
means that only the cost of the \emph{last} unit produced equals
P\emph{.\\

\hypertarget{price-signal}{%
\subsubsection{Price signal}\label{price-signal}}

The price acts as a signal (leading to efficient choices):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  to firms, telling them `how much to produce'
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} Don't produce past the point where your marginal cost
exceeds the price you can get in the market,\\
at the price where the market `clears' \(Q_d=Q_s\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  to consumers, how much to purchase

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    and `which consumers should obtain the units produced'?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} By the definition of the market-clearing price P\emph{,\\
consumers can buy all they desire at P},\\
i.e., buy units until the last unit they buy gives them a marginal
utility of P*.

\emph{Note:} Adv, foreshadowing equilibrium efficiency:\\
This means that each consumer values the last unit they consume at the
same amount\\
thus, we \emph{never} have that the `wrong' consumer obtains the good;\\
no further gains from `exchange among consumers'.\\
If prices were too low (e.g., because of a price ceiling), \(Q_d>Q_s\)\\
demand would have to be rationed, and consumers who valued the product
more than other consumers might not get as much.

\subsection{The Long run}\label{the-long-run}}

Here we assume `free entry and exit' of firms, and a large number of
firms have access to the same production process.

Suppose \emph{positive economic profits} in industry (for efficient
producers)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I.e., \(P^*>AC(q)\) for some q

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(\rightarrow\) Firms enter
  \item
    \(\rightarrow\) Supply curve shifts out
  \item
    \(\rightarrow\) equilibrium price declines
  \item
    \(\rightarrow\) profits decline
  \item
    repeat until economic profit falls to zero
  \item
    i.e., until \(P^*=AC(q)\) for the minimum AC q
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} Positive economic profits are sometimes called `supernormal
profits.'\\
Remember, economic profits are profits \emph{after} subtracting the
(opportunity) cost of capital, management, and other inputs

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Now suppose \emph{negative economic profits} in industry (for
  efficient producers)
\item
  I.e., \(P^*<AC(q)\) for any q

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(\rightarrow\) Firms exit
  \item
    \(\rightarrow\) Supply curve shifts inwards
  \item
    \(\rightarrow\) equilibrium price rises
  \item
    \(\rightarrow\) profits rise
  \item
    repeat until economic profit rises to zero

(This is specifically referred to beginning on slide 39; use

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{Long Run Equilibrium}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Firms choose output to max profit

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Profit max: \(P^* = MC(q)\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

No firms in the market want to exit, and no firms out of the market want
to enter

Zero economic profits:

\(P^* = AC(q)\)

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\emph{Also:}

With free entry and exit (and no limits on production)\ldots{}

all firms in the market must produce the quantity that \emph{minimizes}
their average cost,

and all must have the same average cost

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I.e., \(P* = min AC(q) = MC(q)\) for any firm in the market
\item
  I.e., the MC curve intersects the AC curve at its minimum point.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    And this is the same average cost for all firms
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

all firms (in) produce \(q\) that \emph{minimizes} their AC, and all
\emph{same} average cost

Why?

Why \(P* = min [AC(q)] = MC(q)\) ?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  No profit in equilibrium and firms produce at P=MC.
\item
  Thus \(P*=AC(q)=MC(q)\) for all firms in the market.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Suppose here that a firm were producing at a point \emph{above} it's
  minimum AC,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    i.e., if \(AC(q)> min [AC(q)]\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  it could instead produce at the q that minimised its AC, and make a
  profit (contradicting the above)
\item
  \ldots{} (and so would other firms, who'd be induced to enter)
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} We assume a large number of firms have access to this
efficient technology.\\
As previously mentioned, entry shifts the supply curve out, equilibrium
price falls,\\
until the point where \(P^*=AC(q)\) for firms producing at this lowest
AC point.

\hypertarget{long-run-lr-supply}{%
\subsection{Long Run (LR) Supply}\label{long-run-lr-supply}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We have the SR supply curve (upward sloping)
\item
  But we know that in the LR this will shift out in response to a price
  change
\item
  Taking this shift into account gives us the \emph{Long Run Supply
  Curve}
\end{itemize}

Avoid confusion:\\
In the SR there are movements \emph{along} this curve in response to
price changes.\\
In the longer run, it does shift in response to price changes, as firms
enter.\\
The LR supply curve, which we will now define, does \emph{not} shift in
response to price changes\\
But other things may cause it to shift, like changes in input costs

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{What will the LR supply curve look like?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If demand shifts out, do more enter and produce at the same efficient
  minimum AC?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Depends on whether entry and higher aggregate production
    \emph{change} the firms' cost functions
  \item
    \emph{Input costs} may rise; increased demand for scarce inputs,
    skilled workers and public resources
  \item
    (Also, other potential `externalities' between firms, consumers,
    e.g., network externalities)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} DR opinion: For a variety of reasons, we shouldn't always
expect the LR curve to be upward sloping. It might also be flat or
downward sloping. Thus, if the demand curve for, e.g., microchips or
personalised software shifts out, we may see that equilibrium price
\emph{declines} in the long run.

\bigskip

\emph{Relevant to impact of long run population and economic growth}

\emph{Note:} Economic and population growth leads to increased demands
for most products (especially natural resources and other primary
products). The shape of the LR supply curve tells us whether real
resource prices will increase rapidly over time.\\
The relative slope for different products tells us which prices will
rise \emph{relative} to prices for other goods. E.g., will housing
become relatively more or less expensive?

In the SR you cannot shut down and avoid the fixed costs, whether or not
you sell any units.\\
Since you are already incurring these, they don't count against the
benefit you would get from selling at the market price.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the LR, profits are zero, and all costs are variable, so producer
  surplus is zero
\end{itemize}

Adv: When a firm owns a unique resource it can arguably make a LR profit
called a `Ricardian rent'. However this could be seen as the return to
an asset which should be `charged against' these profits.

Economically efficient allocation of resources: maximizes the sum of
consumer and producer surplus. - At market equilibrium there are no more
mutually beneficial exchanges

\bigskip

Basically, a \emph{competitive} market \emph{in equilibrium} maximizes
the sum of producer and consumer surplus.

\emph{Note:} Q* maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus.\\
Any other quantity yields a lower sum.\\
E.g., at Q1 we `lose' the triangle FEG\\
\ldots{} this is called a `deadweight loss' (`DWL') as it is a loss to
society, it just disappears.

\textcolor{blue}{Consider:} Should price-taking firms and perfect
competition be our `baseline' dominant model?

\textcolor{blue}{Is it reasonable to assume?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Free entry of firms/no `barriers'?
\item
  Homogenous products?
\item
  Descreasing returns to scale at some point?
\end{itemize}

These conditions will indeed lead to perfect competition/MC pricing.

But many markets have large entry costs, first-mover advantages, and
perhaps continuously increasing returns to scale. This will lead to
monopoly or oligopoly in the absence of regulation.

Perhaps even more crucially, Most products are also `differentiated'; if
one firm charges slightly more than another firm, it will still capture
the demand from those people whose are `close' to it. People will pay a
little extra to not travel as far. They will also pay a little extra to
get the product that most suits their preferences. In this case, with
free entry, we have something known as `monopolistic competition', which
has some of the characteristics of monopoly (e.g., pricing above
marginal cost) and some characteristics of perfect competition (e.g.,
zero long-run profits). This model is another candidate for bring the
dominant model; there is an active debate about this!

\textcolor{gray}{Note: Basic argument for productive efficiency of competitive equilibrium:
Firms hire more of each input until its 'bang for buck' is the same as all other inputs,
and a single market price for the input will ensure this is the same across firms.
This 'equilibrium' input price must reflect its marginal productivity
in producing the 'last unit' for each and every firm.}

Basic argument for top-level efficiency of competitive equilibrium:
Equilibrium prices from exchange reflect each consumer's marginal rates
of substitution for their last unit This signals to firms the rate at
which \emph{all} consumers would be willing to trade off A for B at the
margin In equilibrium firms produce at a point where the cost tradeoffs
between A and B (slope of PPF) reflects these prices.

What are the characteristics of a public good?

\emph{Def} -- A \textbf{Pure Public Good} is a good that is both

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Non-excludable}: Once the good is provided, it is
  impossible/costly to prevent any individual from using/benefiting from
  it.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Note:} This even includes individuals who have not paid for it

\bigskip

Opposite (and alt definition) \emph{Exclusive goods}: \ldots{} a good is
exclusive if it is relatively easy to bar people from benefitting from
it once it has been produced

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Non-rival:} One person's consumption doesn't reduce the quantity
  available for others.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The fact that some people use the good doesn't prevent others from
  using the \emph{same} good.
\item
  There is no ``crowding.''
\end{itemize}

Alt (equivalent def):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Providable to additional users at zero marginal (social) cost.
\item
  Consumption of additional units of the good involves zero marginal
  social cost of production. (E.g., if we had produced a film but
  restricted it to subscribers, the marginal social cost of letting the
  whole world download it is essentially zero; the exclusion would take
  us away from the `utility frontier')
\end{itemize}

Q: think of some examples.

\emph{Note:} In market economies, private suppliers provide the majority
of goods and services to consumers. However, certain goods are publicly
provided. These include for example defense, education, and health. Why
does the government instead of the market provide these goods? Which
characteristics differentiate goods that are privately provided from
goods that are publicly provided? How do we define public goods? The
terminology might induce the conclusion that `public goods are good that
are publicly provided as opposed to private goods which are privately
provided.' This conclusion is simply WRONG! The public or private nature
of the good is an intrinsic characteristic of goods that is not related
to the provider of the good Hence, it may well be that the state
provides a private good or that the market provides a public good.

\textbf{The basic idea}

If a good is \emph{non-rival} then additional provision is costless.
Thus,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if exclusion is possible, and \emph{any} positive price is charged,
  some are deterred from consuming it
\item
  this is inefficient: people who could benefit from the good, at no
  cost to others, will not consume it :(
\end{itemize}

If a good is \emph{non-excludable} it will be difficult to charge people
for it

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  many might prefer to wait for \emph{others} to buy it, and then they
  enjoy it anyways (free-ride), which could lead to coordination
  problems
\end{itemize}

and\ldots{}

\bigskip

Even if each person provided it for their \emph{own} benefit (on the
assumption that no one else would), they would typically choose
\emph{too little} from a social POV\ldots{}

\bigskip

Considering their own marginal benefits (and MRS) versus the price or
cost, not the \emph{social} marginal benefit (essentially, a positive
externality)

\bigskip

But if firms cannot charge for its full value, they might not pay the
fixed costs to develop/build/provide it

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Who would pay to produce a film that is freely pirated/distributed?
\item
  Who would pay to develop a drug that must be priced at its marginal
  cost?
\item
  Why contribute to police protection for your village, if your
  neighbours will pay for it anyways?
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} Loosely, `rivalryness' basically relates to whether market
provision will be \emph{efficient}; `excludability' tells you whether
firms can make \emph{some revenue} from providing it, selling the same
prooduced good to more than one person (or to a `club' of people)

  \item
    \(\rightarrow\) No incentive to develop drugs without patent

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Possible solution: Government \emph{awards} and subsidies for drug
  development.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} In fact, governments do fund and subsidise R\&D. But there
are difficulties here too. Governments may free-ride off of other
governments. It is also for government to know whom to fund, hard to
quantify the benefits to potential drugs, and offering `prizes' to
developers offers its own challenges: how to asses if the drug is good
enough to deserve the prize? And too many firms working on the same drug
may be wasteful.

However, he will still purchase less than the \emph{socially optimal}
amount, \(Q^*\)

\textbf{Basic results}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On average, subjects contribute halfway between everything and nothing
\item
  Contributions decline with repetition, but not to zero
\item
  Face to face communication improves the rate of contribution

Adv: More recent evidence finds that this decline seems to be related to
issues of reciprocity, fairness and conditional cooperation.\\
When conditional cooperators are separated (or can self segregate) a
higher level of cooperation is maintained.

\emph{Criticisms of monopoly:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Monopolies produce too little output: allocatively inefficient.
\item
  There is a redistribution of wealth from consumers to owners.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  But this could be counterbalanced by government redistribution
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Compared to perfect competition, a monopoly typically produces less
  output and charges a higher price
\item
  Some of the consumer surplus under perfect competition is transferred
  to the monopolist.
\item
  There is also a deadweight loss under monopoly

\emph{Other criticisms:} Some argue the deadweight loss (DWL) above
\emph{understates} the true harm of monopoly

\begin{itemize}
\item
  `Secure' monopolies don't innovate as much, and spend wastefully?
\item
  Monopolies may expend wasteful resources (lobbying, threats,
  lawsuits\ldots) to preserve barriers to entry

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Thus the above monopoly profits may turn into further deadweight
    losses!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  On the other side, some argue monopolies tend not to persist in the
  long run, are disciplined by \emph{potential} entry, and have
  \emph{greater} incentives to innovate
\item
  Empirically, the magnitude of the social cost of monopoly is an open
  question

The standard framework for this involves maximising `expected utility'.

\textbf{Example: two possible outcomes}

\emph{Q: What is an example of such an investment with only two
outcomes?}

Ans: perhaps making a loan to someone to start a business; they will
either pay back the loan with a high interest, or go bankrupt and pay
none of it back.

Suppose there is a simple investment. It will either pay a low (or zero
or negative amount) or a high amount.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It pays X where either \(X =x_1\) or \(X=x_2\), where \(x_1<x_2\)
\end{itemize}

Probability it pays \(x_2\) is \(p\); thus probability it pays \(x_1\)
is\ldots? \(Pr(X=x_1)= 1-p\)

The expected monetary value sums the values weighted by the
probabilities, i.e.,

\(EV(X)=(1-p) x_1 + p x_2\)

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Consider

\textbf{Example: two possible outcomes}

It pays X where either \(X =x_1\) or \(X=x_2\), where \(x_1< x_2\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Specifically, pays \pounds1020 w/ prob. 1\% \& pays \pounds10 w/ prob.
  99\%
\end{itemize}

Thus
\(EV(X) = 0.01 \times 1020 + 0.99 \times 10 = 10.20 + 9.90 = 20.10\)

\hypertarget{example-experimental-measures-of-risk-attitudes}{%
\subsection{Example: experimental measures of risk
attitudes}\label{example-experimental-measures-of-risk-attitudes}}

Economists try to measure people's level of risk aversion in various
ways.

We try to measure `revealed preferences' from real-world choices. E.g.,
what premium are people willing to pay to buy insurance for various
things, how much premium do they demand for taking on risky investments
(with the same expected monetary values), and how much more do they have
to be paid (on average) in jobs with variable compensation?

\bigskip

We also run \emph{experiments} with real or hypothetical payoffs to
measure this.

One technique is the Holt and Laury (2002) risk elicitation task:

\includegraphics[height=2.2in]{picsfigs/holtlaurie.png}

\textcolor{gray}{Asked to choose one in each row (A or B)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider, when would you choose A and when would you choose B?
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/holtlauriedetail.png}

At what point do people switch from choosing the safe to choosing the
risky lottery?

This is a measure of their risk-aversion. A risk-neutral person would
switch to B on the fifth choice. The later you switch, the more risk
averse you reveal yourself to be.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/holtlauryresults.png}

Above: Results for different `stake sizes'. Most people are risk-averse.
People switch to the risky option later when stakes are higher.

\hypertarget{expected-utility}{%
\subsection{Expected utility}\label{expected-utility}}

\textbf{Note: this concept is only covered \emph{indirectly} in the
text}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Previous utility functions: predict choices under certainty

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No predictions for choices with uncertain probabilistic outcomes!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  People don't maximise expected monetary value; tend to be risk-averse
\end{itemize}

An \emph{Expected Utility} (EU) framework allows for risk-aversion

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Assume each individual has a single `utility function over
  \emph{outcomes}' \(u(Y)\) over outcomes Y, (with similar properties as
  our regular utility function)
\end{itemize}

This `little u' function is similar to `regular' utility, but here
`curvature matters'

When making choices involving uncertainty, she does \textbf{not}
(necessarily) maximise expected monetary value.

Instead, she maximises `Expected Utility' (EU): the sum of her (VNM)
valuations `\(u(\cdot)\)' under each outcome weighted by the
\emph{probability} of each outcome

\ldots{} I.e., she chooses to maximise the value of her \(u(Y)\)
function under each outcome \(Y\) weighted by the probability of each
outcome \(p_Y\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  By varying the \(u(Y)\) function we can vary the risk preference;
  \ldots Risk-loving, risk neutral and risk averse individuals can all
  be seen as maximizing EU
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Consider the choice between two gambles and one `certainty':

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Earn £1,000,000 with probability 0.1 \& zero with prob. 0.9
\item
  Earn £100,000 with probability 1/2 \& £50,000 with prob. 1/2
\item
  Earn £75,000 for certain
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Imagine the realised utility \(u(y)\) arises from the consumption chosen
with income \(y\)
\textcolor{gray}{(btw, the utility arising from maximisation under a particular set of income and prices is called 'Indirect Utility')}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This should be increasing (because of nonsatiation), thus
  \(u^\prime (y)>0\)
\item
  But it mays increase at a \emph{decreasing} rate, implying
  \(u^{\prime \prime}(y)< 0\)
\end{itemize}

This second assumption, called \emph{diminishing marginal utility}, will
imply `risk aversion'!

Or, if the person is risk-neutral, it may be linear, thus
\(u(y) = a + by\), thus \(u^{\prime \prime}(y)=0\)

\bigskip

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv:}
\textcolor{gray}{Note that when we were choosing between two goods under certainty,
the *level* of total utility didn't really matter, only the relative utilities. Now that we are considering gambles, the overall utility level matters, because we need to consider the extent of the tradeoff between 'rich and poor' states.}

\bigskip

Coming back to the choice between two gambles and one `certainty':

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(Y_1\): \pounds1,000,000 with probability 0.1 and zero with prob. 0.9
\item
  \(Y_2\): \pounds100,000 with probability 0.5 and \pounds50,000 with
  prob. 0.5
\item
  \(Y_3\): \pounds75,000 for certain
\end{enumerate}

Considering each \emph{outcome} from any of these\ldots{}

we know
\(u(1,000,000) > u(100,000) > u(75,000)> u(50,000) > u(0)\)\ldots{}

but now the \emph{size of the difference} in these utilities matters for
your decision!

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Consider Y1 vs Y3: Is 1 million `more than ten times as good
  (utility-wise) as 75k?'
\item
  Y2 v Y3: Relative to 75k, does an additional 25k yield a utility gain
  worth the (equally probable) loss of 25k?
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{Illustration:} Why the `size of the difference in u(y) matters'
when dealing with uncertainty.

Suppose there is open-enrollment in Oxford, Bristol, Plymouth.

\(\rightarrow\) Here I only need to know the \emph{ranking} of utilities
of each to know your choices.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you choose Oxford over Bristol, even though Oxford costs more, I
  can infer that for you \(U(Oxford)>U(Bristol)\)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Now, in contrast suppose the policy is

\begin{quote}
A. Rank Oxford over Bristol and you have a 25\% chance of getting into
either, and a 50\% chance of Plymouth.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
B. Rank Bristol highest and you have a 100\% chance of getting into
Bristol.
\end{quote}

Now even if your preferences are Oxford \(\succ\) Bristol \(\succ\)
Plymouth, I don't know if you will choose A or B; I would need to know
the \emph{strength} of your preferences.

\bigskip

This means that if I observe you choose `option A' I have learned
\emph{more} about your utility than I learned under open enrollment. I
have learned that your preference for Oxford over Bristol is
``stronger'' than your preference for Bristol over Plymouth.

\bigskip

The EU framework predicts that she chooses the option that maximizes the
sum of `probabilities \(\times\) realised utilities \(u(Y)\) of each
outcome \(Y\)'. For a two-outcome case:

\[EU = (1-p) u(Y_\ell) + p u(Y_h)\]

\ldots{} where \(p\) is the probability of the higher income \(Y_h\) and
\(Y_\ell\) is the lower income.

\bigskip

\textcolor{RawSienna}{Adv:}
\textcolor{gray}{This framework is justified by certain 'reasonable axioms' we might expect choices under uncertainty to follow,
although these are perhaps not as readily acceptable as the main axioms of regular utility theory (like transitivity).
... e.g., the choices made under EU converge to the choices made under certainty as probabilities tend to 1.
The EU framework yields nice consistent behavior and can be reconciled with general equilibrium theory, preserving the basic welfare theorems}

\hypertarget{risk-aversion-graphical-depiction}{%
\subsection{Risk aversion: graphical
depiction}\label{risk-aversion-graphical-depiction}}

\textbf{How to illustrate this:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Show:
  \(EU(gamble) = (1-p)u(x_{low}) + pu(x_{high}) < u(EV(x)) = u((1-p)x_{low} + px_{high})\)
\end{itemize}

Draw a diagonal line between \(u(x_{low})\) and \(u(x_{high})\); the
Expected Utility is in between these.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Horizontal distance \(p\) of the way between \(x_{low}\) and
  \(x_{high}\)
\item
  Project up to diagonal for average of functions (EU)
\item
  Compare this to the vertical height of utililty function at same point
  \((1-p)x_{low} + px_{high}\)
\end{itemize}

This is a mathematical/graphical property.

Intuition: The slope of a line tells me `rise for a given run', the
`expectation' calculation is a linear function, so the slope is constant
and the `share of the rise' simply projects up from the `share of the
run'

distribution}\label{illustration-binomial-distribution}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Suppose I have \pounds 1000, and I can bet on fair coin flips. My
  returns will then have what we call a ``binomial distribution''.
\end{itemize}

There is a nice illustration of binomial distributions

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If I bet all \pounds 1000 in a single flip, there is a 50\% chance I
  will lose my entire investment.
\item
  If I bet \pounds 500 on two flips, there is only a 25\% chance I will
  lose my entire investment (also reduces chance of doubling by 25\%).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The expected value is the same (0); thus this is better if you are
    risk averse.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

``Less risky'': B and A overlap with 0.5 probability; the remaining 50\%
of time A's outcomes are more extreme. So it is less risky in a very
general sense.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If I bet \pounds 100 each in ten flips, there is a 38\% chance that I
  will lose 20\% or more of my investment.
\item
  If instead, I bet it on 1000 coin flips, betting \pounds 1 on each,
  there is only 6.00\% chance I will lose 5\% of my investment or more,
  and only 1/10th of 1\% chance that I will lose 10\% of my investment
  or more.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\emph{Result}: The more I can do this ``diversification'', the less risk
I face.

\bigskip

\emph{Note}: For simplicity, these examples have a `fair coin flip',
zero expected-return investment.

\bigskip

But you might be wondering: `why invest at all? Answer: Because this
principle also applies to 'unfair coin flips'.

\bigskip

E.g., investments in the stock market are more profitable on average
than money under the mattress

Each £1 invested in shares has a higher expected return, but also a
higher risk. However by spreading across \emph{many different} assets we
can reduce this risk, as seen above

The pilot could buy put options (rights to sell at a price) in the

theory says chess has a pre-determined outcome and is a bit boring (ok,
you may agree about the latter).

\textcolor{gray}{Adv: But there are complicating issues making it difficult to asses the predictions of game theory.
Particularly because monetary payoff may not be the same as utility payoffs ... this can make real-world predictions unclear.
Particularly if there are social preferences or fairness preferences.\
We also see failures to coordinate,
failure to take higher-order cognitive steps

A set of \emph{strategies}, one for each player, that are best responses

Note this is the same `prediction' as dominant strategies, but the
interpretations are different; This is not by accident, there is a

  will do in each of his two possible `decision nodes'
\end{itemize}

\emph{Notes:} Here we see there is a `first-mover advantage'.\\

We see a very similar strategic concern in other contexts, including
`which firm enters a market first'. Suppose that if two firms are in a
market there will be a price war with consumers as well as a bidding up
of input prices and salaries, and both will lose money. Perhaps by being
the first firm to enter I `scare off the other firm' and I can keep the
profits. The other firm may `threaten to enter' but that would seem to
be a non-credible threat! On the other hand, suppose that I know that if
I enter first the other firm can `learn from my mistakes' and free-ride
off my innovation. Here we would have a `second-mover advantage'; but in
such a game a BWI may lead to the outcome `neither firm enters'!

These concerns also apply to politics, and the games can of course
include multiple players

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cameron's decision to allow a referendum, followed by politician's
  (Boris etc) decisions to choose a side?
\item
  May's negotiations with the EU (Barnier), followed by the parliament's
  `meaningful vote', followed by ??
\item
  US Supreme court fight over Brett Kavanaugh, the sequential decisions
  of the last `swing' senators

\item
  Motives like `fairness' may transform monetary payoffs into `real'
  payoffs in a straightforward way

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    E.g., in the ultimatum game, suppose player 1's real payoffs are:
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\[U_1(Y_1,Y_2) = Y_1 - |Y_1-Y_2|\]

\bigskip

Where \(Y_1\) is the amount 1 earns from the ultimatum game, and \(Y_2\)
is 2's income from this game.

\bigskip

Similarly for player 2:

\[U_2(Y_2,Y_1) = Y_2 - |Y_1-Y_2|\]

\bigskip

\emph{Here each player gains 1 unit of utility for each pound they earn,
but loses a unit of utility for every pound of difference between the
payoffs.}

\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{picsfigs/ultimatumgametree.png}

\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{picsfigs/ultimatumfairness.png}

\emph{Notes:} Here if earnings are equal, real payoffs are the same as
earnings; 0,0 or 5,5\\
Where earnings are unequal, player-1 gets 9 and player-2 gets 1 from
material payoffs.\\
But because of a difference of 8 in earnings, both players lose 8 in
psychological payoffs\\
so the net real payoffs if player-1 offered 1 and 2 accepted would be
9-8=1 for player-1 and 1-8=-7 for player-2.\\
Using BWI here we see the subgame perfect NE will be that player-1
offers 5 and player-2 accepts.

`Envy payoffs'

\includegraphics[height=3.5in]{picsfigs/ultimatumenvy.png}

\emph{Notes:} Here we assume because of `envy', real payoffs equal
material payoffs minus the difference in payoffs \emph{for the player
with lower payoffs only.}\\
For the outcomes considered, only player-2's payoffs are adjusted from
the material payoffs;\\
she gets 1-8 = -7 from accepting an offer of 1; her payoff is 1 but she
loses 7 in envy.\\
Because of this she will not accept such an offer. Knowing this,
player-1 will offer 5.

\hypertarget{supplemental-reading-evidence-on-the-ultimatum-game}{%
\subsection{Supplemental (reading): Evidence on the Ultimatum
Game}\label{supplemental-reading-evidence-on-the-ultimatum-game}}

Guth et al.~(1982) presented the first experimental test of the
ultimatum game.

\bigskip

2 players: Proposer and Responder

\bigskip

Proposer has a pie of size 1. She must propose a split of the pie
between the two players \((1-s, s)\)

The Responder may:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  accept (in which case the split is executed)
\item
  reject (in which case both players get zero
\end{itemize}

This is a `take it or leave it offer' in bargaining. What do you think
he/she will offer? Do you think he/she will accept? Why or why not?

\hypertarget{ultimatum-game-theoretical-predictions}{%
\subsection{Ultimatum game: theoretical
predictions}\label{ultimatum-game-theoretical-predictions}}

Allowing `non-credible threats', this game has as many Nash equilibria
as there are possible splits of the pie

In each of them, the Responder's strategy is to `accept only if offered
X (or more)' for some \(X\geq0\), and the Proposer's strategy is to
offer exactly X.

But maybe these equilibria don't seem like reasonable predictions (why?)

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Q: What does SPNE predict (use backwards induction)?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the split is \((1,0)\), the Responder is indifferent between
  accepting and rejecting
\item
  That still means the Proposer offering \((1,0)\) and the Responder
  accepting is a NE
\end{itemize}

The subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is found by solving the game
backwards:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Proposer (correctly) anticipates the Responder will accept any
  offer

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Thus she offers zero, which is accepted `in equilibrium'
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A `near zero' offer would lead to a similar result, and might seem
  more intuitive
\end{itemize}

  be if I win the bonus

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    Let \(c\) be own consumption, \(Y\) income pre-bonus, \(w\) the
    bonus amount, and \(g_b\) the committed donation `if you win \(w\)'
  \item
    Choose \(g_b\) to maximize utility \(u(c, g)\) s.t. budget
    constraint \(c+g \leq Y+w\)
  \item
    If asked to pre-commit `if I win', I commit to that choice, so
    \(g_b=g^*\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

  \(u(c, g)\) s.t. budget constraint \(c+g \leq Y+w\)

  \textbf{Reputation:} If I give to benefit my reputation or
  self-esteem, \emph{unrealised} donations may matter, not just donation
  outcomes

  \begin{itemize}

    May be an incentive to commit \emph{more} the less likely a donation
    needs to be paid
  \item
    `If I win the lottery megabucks, I will give it all away'
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Loss aversion:} If I am `loss averse' over my own consumption,
  it may seem `cheaper' to commit before I win the bonus than after

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Why? Because my \emph{reference point} may change.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Suppose I've \pounds50k income and a potential \pounds50k bonus with
  50\% probability

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Before winning my reference consumption may be the EV, \pounds75k
  \item
    So a conditional donation to donate \pounds10k if I have a total
    income+bonus of \pounds100k may not seem like a loss
  \item
    But after I win the bonus, my new reference consumption may be
    \pounds100k
  \item
    So each pound donated might feel like a loss

\textbf{(25 marks) In this module we discussed \textit{four} major ways
in which behavioural economists argue that people diverge from classical
assumptions. Briefly explain each of these four ways, citing some
evidence (academic or anecdotal) for each.}

There are four general ways people diverge from classical assumptions

\textbf{1. Limited cognitive ability \(\rightarrow\) difficult and
costly to make complex decisions}

It may be very costly and difficult to do the calculations that we
assume are part of standard maximization. Rather than strictly finding
the optimal consumption bundles, choosing the optimal number of hours to
work per day, calculating the optimal investment portfolio, etc. people
may use heuristics and `rules of thumb'.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\underline{Evidence for Limited Cognitive Ability:}
\textcolor{gray}{This is too long an answer, I'm just giving you some ideas}

Systematically incorrect answers to simple financial literacy questions;
and responses correlate with holding an extremely high interest loans.

Many people state they have keep separate fixed budgets for different
categories of expenditure (food, vacations, charity etc).

In marketing/behavioral experiments adding more choices has sometimes
been found to reduce purchases within a category.

Also, adding an (unchosen) `largest size' choice seen to increase
consumption of the second largest choice (heuristic: `choose the middle
option')

See also `taxi driver's heuristic'

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\underline{2. Limited willpower $\rightarrow$  self control problems}

People struggle to make choices that they know are in their best
long-term interest. (Evidence: see next part)

\underline{3. Limited self interest $\rightarrow$  care about others (fairness, altruism), issues beyond income/consumption}

\textit{Evidence:} Significant charitable giving (1\% of UK GDP), large
part of income spent on family and gifts. Rejection of positive offers
in ultimatum game experiments (in various lab and naturalistic
contexts). Contribution to linear public goods, cooperation in prisoners
dilemmas, even in 1-shot games \ldots{}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\underline{4. Inconsistent, changing, and 'non-outcome-based' preferences}

\small

People seem to act to maximise targets and avoid losses relative to
reference points. For example several papers report evidence consistent
with people (e.g., taxi drivers) setting `earnings targets' and thus
working \textit{fewer hours} on days when their per-hour earnings are
higher (and they should know this). It can be shown that if drivers were
to work fewer hours on `bad' and more hours on `good' days they could
more money working the same number of hours, and even have less variance
in a number of hours they work. This cannot be reconciled with a model
maximising an unchanging utility function.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{(25 marks) For \textit{TWO} of the major departures above, give
a \textit{specific example} of such behaviour, and briefly describe the
nature of the evidence for this, and present one behavioural economics
model explaining this behaviour.}

\textbf{First departure I am discussing: 'Inconsistent, changing, and 'non-outcome-based' preferences'}

\bigskip

\textbf{`Specific example of behaviour'}

The Allais paradox offers evidence against Expected Utility maximisation
(over outcomes) and in line with Loss Aversion and Prospect Theory.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Scenario such as

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Gamble A: 89\% chance win \pounds 1 mln, 10\% chance win \pounds 5
  mln, \& 1\% chance win 0.
\item
  Gamble B: \pounds1 million with certainty.
\end{itemize}

\textit{vs.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Gamble C: 89\% chance of winning 0 and an 11\% chance of winning
  \pounds1 million
\item
  Gamble D: a 90\% chance of win 0 and 10\% chance of winning \pounds5
  million.
\end{itemize}

Consistently in hypothetical and incentivised experiments people tend to
choose B over A and also choose D over C.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textit{This contradicts Expected Utility theory}:

If \(B \succ A\) then \(EU(A) > EU(B)\)

\(\rightarrow U(1m) > 0.89 \: U(1m) + 0.1 \: U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0)\)

\(\rightarrow\) \(0.11 \: U(1m) > 0.1 U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0)\)

\medskip

\bigskip

However, if \(D \succ C\) then \(EU(D)>EU(C)\)

\(\rightarrow 0.9 \: U(0) + 0.1 U(5m) > 0.89 \: U(0) + 0.11 \: U(1m)\)

Implying \(0.1 \: U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0) > 0.11 \: U(1m)\)

Contradicting the above!

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\small

\textbf{`Describe the nature of evidence for this'}

\underline{Evidence:} In hypothetical experiments by Kahneman and
Tversky, as well in experiments with real incentives (e.g., Huck and
Muller), people tend to choose B over A, and also to choose D over C.
(Sometimes the same people will make of these apparently inconsistent
choices but in general the differences in proportions are large enough
that we can show the general pattern even if we're only asking people to
make a single choice.)

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\textbf{`\ldots and present one behavioural economics model'}

\textit{Why do many people choose B over A and D over C?}

\bigskip

\underline{One theory: Loss aversion/Prospect theory}

\footnotesize

Theory: People evaluate outcomes relative to \textit{reference points}.
Falling below these reference points is particular costly to utility;
the usual specification models utility as the some of a standard
risk-averse utility function and a ' gain-loss' utility function. The
latter is negative where some outcome (e.g., earnings) falls below a
reference point; it's slope is assumed to be greatest for `small losses'
and then more gradual for larger losses. In net this can make people
risk seekers over a range of losses, willing to increase the risk of a
large loss to reduce the risk of a small loss. The reference points
themselves may change depending on the framing of the decision, on
previous expectation, on unrealised states, and in general on things
that are not relevant to future material outcomes of the decision.

\textit{Applying this to the example above ... (Allais Paradox)}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Considering A \& B, the ref. point may be close to \pounds1000, as
  this can be had with certainty.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A seems to `risk a costly loss of \pounds1000', thus may choose
    `safer' \(B>A\), notwithstanding its far lower EV (\pounds1000 vs
    \pounds1390)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Considering D \& C, ref. point may be close to 0, as EV's of each are
  low, \& 0 is likeliest outcome

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    So `don't worry about losses', choose D over C because higher EV
    (\pounds500 vs.~\pounds110)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{gray}{This could also be shown with a diagram of EU in income, and a  shifting reference point ; see notes and text}

\emph{By the way, here are some more behavioural econ problems to
practice \ldots{} from Nicholson and Snyder chapter 17 (12th ed, 11th
similar)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  17.2: this will be especially helpful for understanding the EU basis
  of the Allais Paradox
\item
  17.3
\item
  (17.5)
\item
  17.7: pretty good setup for time inconsistent behaviour
\item
  (17.8) - also a good setup for time inconsistency, has video solution
  on CourseMate
\item
  17.9 - decent for understanding loss aversion. Should say `would his
  choice change \emph{if} his reference point' (`if' is missing)
