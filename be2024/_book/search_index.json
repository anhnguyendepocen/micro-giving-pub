I hope that this module helps you see the world in a new way and gain insights about business, government, and your everyday life. If you put the time into this module, you can get a lot out of it, and you may gain skills and access approaches that you will use throughout your career. As students at a Russell group institution, I expect you to work hard and engage intellectually to gain a serious and critical understanding of key Economics concepts. Learn how and when these can be applied, what their limitations are, and how these can these are misused and misunderstood. I hope you learn these core ideas well enough that you could explain them to others and apply them to unfamiliar situations. This is not necessary to gain a good mark: I hope that you all will be able to gain a good mark, and I will try to be lenient. But I would suggest you aspire to get more out of this than a mark. You should aim not only to achieve a distinction mark, but to be able to impress me with your understanding and insight, to gird your loins for future courses applying this material, and to gain the acumen to understand key research issues, and participate in business discussions and policy debates. I wrote these notes to outline all of the material you are responsible for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short amount of time we have during lecture. I don’t mean you’re simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that these notes will aim to refer to everything that you are responsible for. These notes are meant to be a complement to the textbook (and to the lectures, tutorials/problem sets, readings and other material on the ELE) and to tie all of this together. I am providing you these notes both as a complete file as well as divided by lecture week (approximately). Use either version. I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in these notes. However, each year the module adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to these notes as we go along. I will try to keep you informed of any changes via the VLE forums. Notes versus slides?: These notes should include all of the slide material plus explanatory notes and enrichment material. I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will also try to make the slides themselves available after the lectures, even though they are redundant– these notes have everything. Some ‘markers’ and abbreviations: ‘NS’ refers to the Nicholson and Snyder text (usually chapters/numbering from the 12th edition is referenced; if you’re using an earlier edition, make sure the content corresponds) indicates advanced material and discussion you are not required to know but may find interesting, and will help you in later courses/modules in Economics, and give you a hint at what is to come if you pursue this course further. Knowing this stuff might also help your mark and the impression you make when asking for letters of reference. This is also included to give you a more nuanced picture: when I took a similar module as an undergraduate I tended to believe ‘all the economics problems are solved and the solutions and implications are obvious.’ These ‘Adv’ comments are often caveats and critiques. indicates advanced mathematical material. ‘LC’ indicates a lecturer comment I may make in lecture that you don’t need to worry about (I meant to cut these but I sometimes forget to) ‘Comprehension Q:’ A question you should be able to answer if you are following along. ‘T numbers’ refer to the weeks of term that intended to cover specific material. For example ‘T1:03 - T1:04a’ means ‘term 2 week three (both lectures) and term 2 week 4, first lecture only’ "],

["course-information.html", "3.1 Course Information", " 3.1 Course Information Some quick notes on this module and how it fits into your course structure This module is: Compulsory for BSc Business Economics and BA Business Economics Also for PPE I believe The prerequisites are BEE1029 (for most students) or BEE1034 or BEE1030 and BEE1031 The prerequisites are very different, the students in this module may come from diverse backgrounds. We will try to focus on material: not covered in BEE1029 or more rigorous and detailed versions of this, and real world applications, especially in business. Some of you may have already seen some of the material covered here. If so, try to learn it in more detail, become better at explaining it to others, and learn to apply it to real-world issues. Note: From 2020 onwards, all students in this module will come from the “CORE ESPP” You may also find this to be a useful resource, for revision, motivation, and as a supplement to the Nicholson/Snyder text (Also, see “The Economy” 1.0) for more straight Economics A note on maths: As I will explain, this course will involve a certain level of maths; things like simple algebra, understanding what functions are and how to draw them, and understanding the very basic idea that ‘the derivative of a function is a function telling you the slope of the original function’. If you are math-phobic, you need to try to get over this and make maths your friend and your horse. You can ride it for miles! You will also come to notice that I emphasize logic, precise definitions, and careful connected explanations. I don’t want you to be saying/writing things that could be interpreted in multiple ways, like “the demand will go up”. However, this is not the core Economics module (bee2038: Microeconomics II). If you want a more precise, theoretically complete and mathematically rigorus treatment of this material, particularly if you are studying Economics and/or want to go to postgraduate study in a related field you probably should switch to that module. Further suggested maths resources are given below, under (#Other-maths-resources). 2018: Note to students in Managerial economics who took the BEE1034 ‘Economics for Management’ last term I realise that you are facing a special challenge this year because of the changes in this particular prerequisite module, with less ‘conventional Economics’ covere . In 2018 I discussed with your student-staff liaison committee chair on how to give you further support. One of the things she suggested was to point you in the direction of the text Edexcel AS/A level Economics. This should be accessible online. I have looked through this book and I agree that it will be helpful both as a prerequisite and to give you a more basic explanation (A-levels) of some of the things that we are covering in this module. In particular (note these chapters are very short): From “theme one: introduction to markets and market failure” Chapter one: Economics as a social science Chapter 3: the economic problem Chapter 4: production possibility frontiers Chapter 7: rational decision-making Chapter 8: Demand (super-important!) but please don’t use their somewhat imprecise language \"fall/increase in demand/increase in demand) (Chapters 9 and 10 are essentially re-covered from scratch in our module, going beyond A-level material) Chapter 11: Supply Chapter 12: price determination Chapter 13: the price mechanism (much of Chapters 14, 15, and 16 cover material overlapping what we are covering, again at a more basic ‘A-levels’ level; you may find these helpful) From ‘Theme 3: business behaviour and the labour market’ Chapter 42: revenue Chapter 43: Production chapter 44: Costs (we don’t get to all of this in this module) chapter 45: profit Chapter 46: market structure (just to get the basic idea) Chapter 47: perfect competition Chapter 50: monopoly (we re-cover much of this and go a bit further) (Much of these chapters in theme 3, as well as chapter 54, overlaps what we are covering, but at the A-level) I also highly recommend the microeconomics material from the Khan Academy; I will also give you an outline of which sections are most relevant there. Of course I am also very accessible if you have any questions or need clarification, or just want to talk about some of the material you are struggling with. As I always say, you should feel free to come by my office hours or to make a special appointment outside of these hours I think students who have come to my office hours will definitely agree that they have found been helpful and not stressful. I also encourage you to ask specific questions on the ELE student forum which I will answer carefully. You can also ask questions directly on any of the dropbox hosted files if you get a free dropbox account, and I will try to respond to all of these. "],

["this-module.html", "4.3 This module", " 4.3 This module bee2038: Economic Principles and Policy (microeconomics) Lectures Problem sets: There are eight problem sets, each covering a specific block of material. The material in these problem sets either comes from exams or builds exam skills. Representative answers for each problem set will be given a few days after each problem set is released, or shortly before the relevant support class. Classes (AKA ‘tutorials’ AKA ‘seminars’) every fortnight (5 total) Support classes will largely focus on covering (exploring, solving, discussing) the problem sets. However, there will obviously not be time to cover every question in the tutorial. Note there are only 5 tutorials but 8 problem sets; thus, tutorials may cover problems from multiple recent problem sets. These classes are about applying material you have learned, not lecturing on it or learning it for the first time. Come ready to ask questions and participate: The classes are a smaller group setting than the lectures; we aim to make these highly interactive and participatory. To really be helpful, we need to know what areas you might be struggling with and where your logic might be breaking down; thus we will either do cold calling or highly encourage all the students in these tutorials to ask and answer questions. Think of these as (especially) ‘safe spaces’; you will be judged or marked based on your performance in the support classes, and there are no dumb questions. If you have a question many of your peers probably have the same question, so asking it provides a public good. Marks for Microeconomics component First ‘midterm’ examination, 90 minutes, fully MCQ (but may require ‘choose all that are correct’); 15 marks (30% of term mark) Final examination, 120 minutes, MCQ, solved problems, short essays: 35 marks (70% of term mark) Important: Final exam open response (essays/short answer) questions test your deep understanding and ability to explain concepts. I will help you prepare for this, and give you examples. Five essential competencies (for economics students) Apply the scientific process to economic phenomena Analyse and evaluate behaviors and outcomes using economic concepts and models Use quantitative approaches in Economics Think critically about economic methods and their applications Communicate economic ideas in diverse collaborations paraphrased from Algood and Bayer, 2017 American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings, “Learning outcomes for economists”.

In particular, I have eliminated or consolidated much of the material on the firm’s production function and costs. In earlier surveys, this was the topic students liked the least. In 2019 I am removing the coverage of the history of supply and demand curves and a few other topics. Better integration of the problem sets and tutorials with the lectures and the assessments. Better coordination across tutorial sessions. In 2019 I will be providing more practice multiple-choice questions closely emulating the style of MCQ’s that will be on the midterm and final exam Materials: Greater motivation for each lecture. Less content in the slides themselves (less busy). A more complete narrative in the handout files, making these more readable Opportunity to feedback/discuss the handout and problem sets directly on these files (through Dropbox comments) Lectures, tutorials and notes will have a greater focus on carefully explaining the important concepts that many students struggled with (e.g., Expected Utility) I will try to provide more vision coverage and supplementary materials for managerial economics students.

["the-story-of-this-module.html", "4.6 The story of this module", " 4.6 The story of this module Note: You will have seen many of these concepts before. But do you really understand them well enough to explain them to a non-economist and to apply them to a new real-world situation? And do you understand the limits and critiques of these, and how economists try to measure and test them? 4.6.1 1. Economic basics (weeks 1-2) In weeks one and two we will go over some of the simple tools in the economists’ kit. I will try to explain to you what we mean by ‘economic models’ and give you some examples of these which may be familiar to you. I will not go over the math tools in the lecture; you should study/revise this on your own. We will go over many of these again briefly as we apply these math tools to our economic models throughout the module. We will also start thinking about, and formalisng individual decisions—over nearly all spheres of life— in a way you may not have seen before, which may even strike you as weirdly hyper-rational. Essentially, this (sometimes confusingly called ‘normative decision theory’) is the way economists typically conceive of and model people’s choices. Even though it seems to require precise optimization, perhaps to a strange extent, there are various reasonable justifications for this, and you might also see it as a benchmark… ‘Let’s understand what optimization would look like, as a starting point’. This framework is actually fairly general; it can allow all sorts of preferences (e.g., embodying ‘risk aversion’ and ‘altruism’) and wide-ranging choices. However it does imply certain ‘restrictions’: it rules out some sort of behavior that is perhaps obviously illogical. We will discuss how ‘preferences’ may define the ‘utility functions’. The ‘uility function’ is the thing that make choices in order to maximize. In the classical framework, people make choices in order to maximise the value of their utility function. Utility functions can also be expressed in terms of ‘indifference curves’ (but keep the distinction in mind; the indifference curves are not themselves the utility functions). Under this framework individuals make the ‘optimal choices’ … by making the choices that yield the maximum value of the utility functions given their constraints … in particular they have a ‘budget constraint’ that says they cannot spend more than they earn. You will learn how to derive these budget constraints and plot these on a graph, along with the indifference curves, and to interpret these diagrams. 4.6.2 2. Building the model, putting it together, examining it (weeks 3-5) ‘What determines the price and quantities exchanged in an unregulated (or ’free’) market?’ ‘Do markets yield good outcomes?’ These questions have been at the backbone of Economics for millennia, at least since Aristotle. Classical economists such as Adam Smith built-up ideas of how seemingly random and disorganized markets can yield predictable and efficient outcomes, at least under appropriate conditions. Neoclassical and modern economists (such as Alfred Marshall, David Ricardo, Leon Walras, and Paul Samuelson) have formalized these, building models involving of systems of demand and supply and general equilibrium, and have made the case for the efficiency and desirability of the free market outcomes, at least under specified conditions. 1 In the second (and largest) chunk of the course, we will learn some of the essential building blocks of this model, and how they are justified and put together to yield predictions for market outcomes and ‘welfare’. In the process, we will get useful ideas and intuitions about the working of markets. We will learn how individual optimization implies a relationship between the price of a good (and the consumer’s income) and the amount a consumer chooses to purchase of that good; her individual demand curve. Adding up these individual demand curves yields the market demand curve, which describes the way the total amount of a good consumers wish to purchase depends on the market price of that good. Someone has to make this stuff, you know! We consider ‘production functions’ that map how inputs can be turned into outputs. If firms are seeking to maximize profits, then whatever output they want to produce … they will try to produce it using the combination of inputs (Capital, labor, etc.) that can do this at the lowest cost. If we know production functions and input costs, we can describe a firm’s cost of producing every amount of a particular good. Economists typically assume that firms make choices to maximize profits. (Mathematically, this ‘optimisation’, i.e., maximisation, has some things in common with the consumer optimisation of utility, so it may look familiar). Knowing their cost of production and the demand curve they will face, firms will thus choose to produce the amount that yields them the highest profit; we will explain the conditions for this. With ‘free entry/exit of firms’ we have the (ideal) situation of perfect competition. Each firm’s supply curve is added up to generate the market supply curve; we consider this in both the ‘short and long run’. We define the concepts of ‘consumer surplus’ and ‘producer surplus’; adding these yields the total value in an economy or the total ‘social welfare’. We will briefly and roughly consider the idea of an equilibrium in all markets; prices such that quantity demanded equals quantity supplied for all outputs and inputs. We will get some sense of the idea of what general ‘economic efficiency’ means. I will state and give you some intuition behind the ‘first and second welfare theorems’; the conditions under which free markets yield ‘good outcomes’, defined in a particular sense. 4.6.3 3. How the market can go wrong (and how to maybe fix it) (weeks 6-7) Notice I kept saying “under certain conditions” free markets yield good outcomes. These conditions may not hold, for various reasons. In the third chunk, we discuss two of these reasons, which lead to ‘market failures’. It is important to understand these. These (sometimes) offer a justification for government intervention, and help us understand how government can best respond. These also offer insights for business models; which ‘goods’ may be hard to provide without government subsidies, and how can we use technological innovation to capture value and reduce the extent of market failures? (Businesses may also be able to take advantage of market failures in ways that are harmful to public welfare, But I would hate to think I’m training you to do this.) Not all goods can easily be restricted to a single consumer. ‘Non-rival’ and ‘non-excludable’ goods (e.g., a fireworks display) are called public goods: these will tend to be undersupplied by the free market, as we will come to understand. We will also discuss the evidence for the private provision of these, and consider government’s ability to provide them. This is the polar opposite market structure to perfect competition; a monopoly is a single firm that exclusively dominated a particular industry. It will tend to produce less and charge more than would be socially optimal, yielding a ‘deadweight loss’ (aka ‘DWL’). ‘Price discrimination’ is (more or less) when a firm charges different prices to different consumers; this can reduce (or increase) the ‘deadweight loss’ of monopoly, as we will learn. 4.6.4 4. Extensions to the model and applications (weeks 8-10) In the final chunk we extend the model to accommodate some important aspects of the real world. We investigate the implication of these for market outcomes. We make many decisions without knowing exactly what the consequence of each choice will be. Economists typically model this using the “expected utility” framework. A warning: students often get this concept wrong, so be careful. Expected utility is not the same as ‘expected monetary value’; and this allows EU to embody risk aversion. For many decisions we make the consequences depend on what others do; we have ‘strategic interaction’. Economist usually consider this using the framework and tools of game theory. People may not actually make decisions In the hyper-rational way we have been assuming. Here we carefully consider the adaptation of some insights from Psychology to Economics, yielding ‘behavioral economics’ Much of this work has tried to specify more and more general conditions for this, requiring less and less stringent assumptions.↩ "],

["fortune-cookie-wisdom.html", "4.11 Fortune Cookie Wisdom", " 4.11 Fortune Cookie Wisdom Here are some broad Lessons that I hope you take away from this module, And that will help you throughout… I will come back to these. It may seem like we have the answers, but this is only where we have asked the questions very carefully But sometimes ignorance is bliss. Examples: Sunk-cost fallacy, gains to trade/comparative advantage, opportunity cost, free-riding/prisoners’ dilemma, double-marginalization,‘raise price to raise profit’, etc. I’ve had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife. Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out. We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a ‘single representative consumer’. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights. However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or testing these models, be careful; people may differ and they may change and they may have multiple motives. Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets \\(\\rightarrow\\) opportunities. I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse. I’m not telling you what you need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics. As I also mentioned, these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks. Here are some possible examples. Imperfection: Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘All you can eat’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Free-riding on public goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves). Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high. A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit. here, presentation slides here, my research page is here. Asymmetric information, adverse selection \\(\\rightarrow\\) This one is a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA. Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later). There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance ( or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well.

The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets. Largely, using theoretical and mathematical ‘models’ that depend on strong assumptions.

Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above questions? The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models. Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop’s fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of ‘Ceteris paribus’ (all other things being equal) can help us here. What do models give us?

You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced. Note: PPF illustrates key principles Principle 1: Scarce Resources Principle 2: Scarcity involves opportunity cost. Notes: The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it. The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone ‘next best’ opportunity from a choice. I may just call this ‘cost’ Comprehension question (advanced): On the PPF the opportunity cost of more clothing is less food. Principle 3: Opportunity costs are (often) increasing. What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases. To produce more and more clothing you would have to give up increasing amounts of food. The “law” of diminishing marginal returns. I’m somewhat sceptical of this being a ‘law’; there are certainly increasing returns in certain regions. However, you will see it again and again as it is a fairly standard assumption. "],

["marshalls-model-of-supply-and-demand.html", "4.19 Marshall’s Model of Supply and Demand", " 4.19 Marshall’s Model of Supply and Demand Economists and philosophers have long sought to explain ‘what determines the prices, and why do they change the way they do?’ In the 19th century UK prices were falling while quantities were increasing; this was a puzzle. Alfred Marshall argued that a good’s price must equal both the cost to produce and the value (to consumers) of the last unit produced and consumed. He introduced the ‘demand curve’; with a downward slope. This slope was justified by ‘satiation’: for an individual, additional units of a good are usually valued less and less. For example, you might be willing to pay thousands of pounds to be able to access 100 gallons of water rather than no water at all, but if you already have access to a thousand gallons of water, you will not be willing to pay very much for an additional 100 gallons. Furthermore, firms must cater to less and less keen consumers as they wants to sell more and more units. We come back to this later in the module. ‘Willingness to pay’ (wtp) becomes less and less for the next unit purchased, so will buy more only at a lower price. Equivalently, at a lower price more people find the value exceeds the price, and for additional units. With ‘single crossing’ (a fancy condition you can ignore in this module) there is a unique price where \\(Q^s(p)=Q^d(p)\\), and a unique quantity where the last unit’s value to the consumer equals its cost to produce. Scissors analogy The equilibrium model is analogised to a pair of scissors; neither scis cuts alone So don’t ask ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged’? ‘Just like neither scis cuts alone, neither the supply nor the demand curve determines the equilibrium price and quantity in isolation’? Draw: the famous Marshallian cross Can you explain? The inefficiency of any price other than where \\(Q^D(p)=Q^S(p)\\)? If the price was set at a different value, what forces might push it to the equilibrium? Suggested ans: To economists, a ‘shortage’ is where, at the prevailing or imposed price, consumers are willing to buy more than is available. Some consumers get value from the good in excess of the price. In such a case, firms might offer a higher price, or sellers might ask for a higher price. The price rise would reduce quantity demanded (not ‘reduce demand’) and increase quantity supplied (not ‘reduce supply’). To respect yourself in the morning, you must know Which factors cause the supply and demand curves to shift? What causes ‘movements along’ the supply or demand curve? Note: Caveat, to avoid later confusion: These models assume ‘price-taking’; neither buyers nor sellers consider the impact of their choices on prices "],

I will remind you of the rules for dealing with these whenever it is necessary. For linear functions the slope is the same at any point. For nonlinear functions it may differ at each point. Think of the slope of a mountain versus the slope of a wheelchair ramp. The point here is that increasing X by 1 has the same effect on Y wherever you start, for a linear function but a different effect depending on where you start for a nonlinear function Instantaneous rate of change (instantaneous slope) The slope of the line tangent to the curve at a single point Convex function: Slope everywhere increasing, unique minimum where slope \\(=0\\) Concave function: Slope everywhere decreasing, unique maximum where slope \\(=0\\) For these functions the slope is different at each point. Note: We will mainly deal with functions like these, with a single minimum or maximum that occurs at the unique point with slope zero. Quadratic function are convex if the \\(x^2\\) term has a positive sign and concave if it has a negative sign. That’s because at extreme values of x the term with the largest exponent will dominate all other terms. Example of a convex function: Tiger’s golf earnings per game as function of hours of golf retraining… he had to get worse before he could get better, they say. Or cost per smoothie as function of employees behind smoothie counter.

Transitivity (internal consistency): If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C. More is Better (nonsatiation) 5.7.1 1. Completeness The following is : “I cannot choose between a ski holiday and a beach holiday, yet I am not indifferent between these.” Fancy notation: Either A preferred to B, B preferred to A, or A indifferent to B \\[A \\succ B, B \\succ A, \\: or \\: A \\sim B \\] 5.7.2 2. Transitivity \\[ A \\succ B \\: and \\: B \\succ C \\rightarrow A \\succ C \\] Similar for indifference (\\(\\sim\\)) If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer an Apple to a Cherry. In more detail… Intuitively: Transitive preferences are ‘internally consistent’: If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C. Loosely, I might expect this if I think that a person has preferences that can be ranked in a normal way. The standard ‘utility framework’ takes this for granted. If we have any rule over preference such as ‘more is better’ or ‘tastier is better’, this should hold. Also, someone whose makes choices following preferences that are not transitive may quickly be impoverished by a shrewd trader. We do not see this happening in general. If you found someone who strictly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them. This is easiest to illustrate if we allow these goods to be non-discrete and assume ‘more is always better.’ It works as follows: Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry. Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of banana (or ‘money’). Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra. Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra. … Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you’ve drained all of their resources. ### 3. More is better (‘global nonsatiation’) Perhaps this seems unreasonable? One way you might justify it: If the product is a ‘bad’ (e.g., pollution), redefine the product as the absence of the product. The darkly shaded area above represents those combinations of X and Y that are unambiguously preferred to the combination X*, Y*. This is why goods are called ‘goods’; individuals prefer having more of any good rather than less. Combinations of X and Y in the lightly shaded area are inferior to the combination \\(X^{\\ast}, Y^{\\ast}\\), whereas those in the questionable areas may or may not be superior to \\(X^{\\ast}, Y^{\\ast}\\)/ 5.7.3 Who cares? If people obey the first two above assumptions/axioms, the completeness and transitivity\\(\\ast\\), they will make choices in a way consistent with maximising a (continuous) utility function. The third axiom (nonsatiation) makes the maths more convenient, and is necessary for some results/predictions, like establishing that an outcome allows a ‘Pareto improvement’. We are not saying people actually consult a utility function. That would be a dumb thing to say. We are considering that ‘people behave as if they are maximizing utility functions’; this is (basically) equivalent to saying \"people choose based on preferences that satisfy the above assumptions. These axioms stand directly behind ‘revealed preference’ methods for measuring how much people value nonmarket goods, like clean air and national parks. It also gives us a vocabulary and a way to test for violations of this consistency, and make alternate predictions. Also: Axiom 3 (nonsatiation) makes the maths more convenient, and is necessary for some results/predictions Strictly, most results only require a weaker ‘local nonsatiation’ condition How can we compare the “?” areas?

What is special about point C? It’s the point of tangency between the budget constraint and an indifference curve. It’s also (not a coincidence) the point where the slopes are equal. Slope of budget constraint = slope of indifference curve \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\[P_X/P_Y = MRS\\] Note both slopes are negative, so both negative signs cancel out, leaving this condition. 5.14.1 At an optimal consumption choice (given above assumptions) Consume all of income (locate on budget line; follows from ‘more is better’) Psychic tradeoff (MRS) equals market tradeoff (\\(P_X/P_Y\\)) Intuition: If I can give up X for Y in the market (buy less X, get more Y) at a certain rate, and the benefit I get from doing this is at a different rate, I can make myself better off. Thus the original point could not have been optimal. Think about this carefully; it is a key method of proving things in economic theory. Example, for intuition Suppose that at the consumption bundle you choose, your MRS = 1. To remain indifferent, you would be willing to give up 1 burger to get 1 soda. Suppose the price of soda is £1 and the price of a burger is £2. \\(\\rightarrow\\) Price ratio: \\(P_S/P_B = 1/2\\) Thus if you buy one less burger you can buy two more sodas. Thus if you give up one burger, you can get one more soda to keep you indifferent plus an additional soda. This means you would be better off; thus the original bundle wasn’t optimal. 5.14.2 More insight This next bit is fairly mathy. It should be helpful but you can skip over it if you don’t find it so. Recall \\(U=U(X,Y)\\). \\[U_X(X,Y) := MU_X(X,Y)\\] Derivative with respect to X: rate that utility increases if we add a little X, holding Y constant Similarly for \\(MU_Y\\). It turns out the MRS at a point is the ratio of these marginal utilities. MRS: ‘how much Y would I be willing to give up to get a unit of X’? Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each … we can show \\(MRS(X,Y)=\\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\\) Note: The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point – the higher is \\(MU_X\\) – the more Y I am willing to give up to get it. That is why \\(MU_X\\) is in the numerator. The more valuable a bit more Y is at that point – the higher is \\(MU_Y\\) – the less Y I am willing to give up to get a bit more X. That is why \\(MU_Y\\) is in the denominator. The ‘first order change in utility’ (or ‘total differential’) is: \\[ dU = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X}dX + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Y}dY\\] \\[ = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY\\] Where \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X}\\) refers to the partial derivative of U(X,Y) with respect to X, and similarly for Y, i.e., the marginal utility. Essentially, this approximates the total change in utility for very small changes in X and Y. Setting it equal to zero and rearranging it yields the rate, at the margin, one is willing to give up Y for X: \\[dU = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY = 0 \\] \\[\\frac{dY}{dX}=-\\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\\] Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields more intuition: \\[P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y\\] (at each consumption point X,Y) \\[\\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}.\\] I.e., the same ‘bang for each buck’.

An easy example: I might always be indifferent between three pints of mild ale and two pints of strong ale, if they have the same total alcohol content and I only want to get tipsy. So (for perfect substitutes) buy the one that increases it more per-. If goods are not perfect substitutes, MU ratios generally depend on consumption levels.

Shortcut: figure out the proportions it will be consumed in determine the cost of ‘one bundle of the combination’ at given prices … then buy as many such bundles as you can afford You should be able to do this without having taken economics. Suppose you were given £100 and asked to spend it to make as many sausages-with-baps as possible. No one can eat a sausage without a bap, nor vice-versa.

It is based on a ‘typical market basket’ (UK: of 700 different goods and services, excluding housing, updated yearly). A good example, 1982 vs 2012: \\[b_{82}=p^x_{82}x_{82}+p^y_{82}y_{82}\\] \\[b_{12}=p^x_{12}x_{82}+p^y_{12}y_{82}\\] \\[cpi_{12}=\\frac{b_{12}}{b_{82}}\\] Note: An unadjusted (Fixed-basket) CPI ‘claims’ you need \\(I&#39;\\) to be as well off in 2012. I.e., to buy the exact same basket, including vinyl records. But by substituting you could be as well off with the lower level of income \\(I&#39;&#39;\\) (And income \\(I&#39;\\) would actually make you better off). Note that the basket is adjusted yearly, based on a survey of consumers’ spending. But even this is not necessarily the right adjustment, as consumers may be attaining higher or lower utility from these changes. The right adjustment depends on the consumers’ utility functions, which are unobservable. Some additional notes on this, particularly relevant for government policy: The index based on the fixed basket \\(\\frac{p_1 x_0}{p_0 x_0}\\) is called the Laspeyres (LP) index (where the x-terms now refer to bundles of goods consumed in periods 0 and 1). An alternative, the ‘Paasche’ index (PI), considers the relative cost of the current-weighted basket of goods, i.e., \\(\\frac{p_1 x_1}{p_0 x_1}\\). The LP completely ignores substitution and overestimates inflation, as we discussed. If we compensate people enough so that (their consumption implies that) they could have afforded their original basket, when we do the above calculation based on their expenditure, we find LP=1. The PI underestimates inflation. If we compensate people enough so that the bundle they are choosing now is one they could have afforded in the base period, and we do this calculation, we find that PI=1. Essentially, this underestimates inflation because assumes the substitutions people made certainly made in response to price changes them no worse off than they were before. There is a good graphical treatment of this at . They demonstrate that for normal goods, when there is inflation, \\(LP&gt;CV&gt;CS&gt;EV&gt;PI\\): the Laspeyeres adjustment overcompensates for inflation and the Paasche adjustment undercompensates for it. These both bound the ‘true’ necessary adjustments according to either the compensating variation, ‘maintain consumer surplus’, or equivalent variation criteria. You may find it interesting and useful to understand the difference between compensating variation and equivalent variation, and what these mean. Essentially, EV considers ‘if we had held prices constant, what reduction in income would reduce her utility as much as this price increase did’. CV asks ‘after this price increase, how much income do we have to give someone to make them as well off as they were initially?’ (This is the way we have mainly been thinking about it thus far.) it might seem like these amounts would be the same, but they are not the same in general (only for quasi-linear utility). We can may also consider the ratio of actual expenses, the ‘money income index’ (MI), \\(\\frac{p_1 x_1}{p_0 x_0}\\). For an individual, we could use revealed preferences considerations to understand when the consumers better or worse off. For example, suppose that the new expenditure exceeds the cost of the old basket at the new prices, i.e., \\(p_1 x_1 \\geq p_1 x_0\\). This implies that the new basket is revealed preferred to the old basket (i.e., \\(x_1\\) RP to \\(x_0\\)), as the former was chosen when the latter was available. Dividing each side of the above inequality by the original money expenditure yields \\(MI=\\frac{p_1 x_1}{p_0 x_0}\\geq \\frac{p_1 x_0}{p_0 x_0}=LP\\). Thus, is if the money income (MI) index is at least as large as the Laspeyeres index (LP), the consumer is better off than she was before. (However, if the new basket costs more than the old basket at the new prices,, revealed preference tells us nothing, and we do not know whether she is better or worse off.) By a similar consideration, if the MI is less than (or equal to) the Paasche Index (PI), this means the new basket at the old prices is no more expensive than the old basket at the old prices, so the latter is revealed preferred. This implies that the consumer is worse off than in the base period. However, as the actual price indices are calculated using average models for particular groups, the comparison becomes much more complicated, unless consumers have identical preferences and incomes or identical homothetic preferences. There are whole books written about this stuff. Considering this further, even if the CPI measure that is being used overstates true inflation. it might be justified to stick with the system people were promised, and are used to. On the other hand, getting cost-of-living-adjustments (COLA) too high will eventually bankrupt the system, as whatever is being inflated incorrectly will grow and grow geometrically to outstrip the size of the economy/tax base!

This is a rationale for the poll tax, the proposed tax that brought downAmargaret Thatcher’s government A common measure of the burden: ‘amount aperson would be willing to pay to avoid tax’, for a given revenue raised Key to understanding the above example: how do we see that the blue and red dot both raise the same revenue? You could also compute these tax revenues algebraically and see they are the same (see footnote in NS textbook), but it is better to gain intuitive insight. The revenue can be seen as the distance on the vertical axis, representing the value in terms of Y at the pre-tax price ratio. This holds whether we measure it in terms of either commodity – you just have to pick one. The tax revenue is the difference between the individual’s income and the amount he consumes; both measured in terms of one commodity only, according to the actual opportunity cost of that commodity, not measured with the ‘after tax price’.

Elasticity: the measure of the % change in one variable brought about by a 1% change in another variable. a unitless measure; will be the same no matter how these variables are measured. Note: Think of responsiveness when talking about elasticity. Actually it’s a measure from physics having to do with rubber bands, they tell me.

The elasticity is basically the derivative of \\(ln(y)\\) with respect to \\(ln(x)\\); useful to know if you want to run a regression computing an elasticity, or if you want to interpret such a regression.

A caveat is that it might do this for a long term strategic advantage; e.g., to gain customer loyalty and market share, intending to take its profits later. Example and algebra. If price rises by 20% and quantity demanded falls by 20% what happens to revenue? Suppose p=10 and q=10 so TR=100. Then when p=12 and q=8 TR=96. Huh? Price increased by 10% and quantity decreased by 20% so shouldn’t TR be unchanged? TR is unchanged when p*q stays the same. With a change in each \\(\\delta p\\) and \\(\\delta q\\), the new revenue is \\((p+\\delta p)(q+\\delta q) = pq+\\delta p q + \\delta q p + \\delta p \\delta q\\).

Other drivers do exist … The price effects of extra supply take time to build up. I agree on that.

In the longer run, it does shift in response to price changes, as firms enter. The LR supply curve, which we will now define, does not shift in response to price changes But other things may cause it to shift, like changes in input costs What will the LR supply curve look like? If demand shifts out, do more enter and produce at the same efficient minimum AC? Depends on whether entry and higher aggregate production change the firms’ cost functions Input costs may rise; increased demand for scarce inputs, skilled workers and public resources (Also, other potential ‘externalities’ between firms, consumers, e.g., network externalities) Note: DR opinion: For a variety of reasons, we shouldn’t always expect the LR curve to be upward sloping. It might also be flat or downward sloping. Thus, if the demand curve for, e.g., microchips or personalised software shifts out, we may see that equilibrium price declines in the long run.

But many markets have large entry costs, first-mover advantages, and perhaps continuously increasing returns to scale. This will lead to monopoly or oligopoly in the absence of regulation. Perhaps even more crucially, Most products are also ‘differentiated’; if one firm charges slightly more than another firm, it will still capture the demand from those people whose are ‘close’ to it. People will pay a little extra to not travel as far. They will also pay a little extra to get the product that most suits their preferences. In this case, with free entry, we have something known as ‘monopolistic competition’, which has some of the characteristics of monopoly (e.g., pricing above marginal cost) and some characteristics of perfect competition (e.g., zero long-run profits).

Given our inputs, we can produce ‘efficiently’, i.e, along the PPF, and given the amounts of each good produced, it is ‘consumed by the right people’ (no more room for trade) … yet we may still not be at efficiency? We need to produce the right combination of goods. Efficient allocation of resources (‘top-level’ condition) No way to produce more of one good and less of another to make all consumers better off Note: Basic argument for top-level efficiency of competitive equilibrium: Equilibrium prices from exchange reflect each consumer’s marginal rates of substitution for their last unit This signals to firms the rate at which all consumers would be willing to trade off A for B at the margin In equilibrium firms produce at a point where the cost tradeoffs between A and B (slope of PPF) reflects these prices. First fundamental theorem of welfare economics A general competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient, under standard assumptions. Loose intuition: free exchange leaves no room for mutually-beneficial improvements, and firms and consumers optimise Second fundamental theorem Under some fancy assumptions, any Pareto efficient outcome is a competitive equilibrium for some pattern of initial endowments So if we could costlessly redistribute endowments, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome by doing so, and then relying on the free market.

["public-goods-attributes-categories.html", "13.3 Public Goods (attributes, categories)", " 13.3 Public Goods (attributes, categories) What are the characteristics of a public good? Def – A Pure Public Good is a good that is both Non-excludable: Once the good is provided, it is impossible/costly to prevent any individual from using/benefiting from it. Note: This even includes individuals who have not paid for it Opposite (and alt definition) Exclusive goods: … a good is exclusive if it is relatively easy to bar people from benefitting from it once it has been produced Non-rival: One person’s consumption doesn’t reduce the quantity available for others. The fact that some people use the good doesn’t prevent others from using the same good. There is no “crowding.” Alt (equivalent def): Providable to additional users at zero marginal (social) cost. Consumption of additional units of the good involves zero marginal social cost of production. (E.g., if we had produced a film but restricted it to subscribers, the marginal social cost of letting the whole world download it is essentially zero; the exclusion would take us away from the ‘utility frontier’) Q: think of some examples. Note: In market economies, private suppliers provide the majority of goods and services to consumers. However, certain goods are publicly provided. These include for example defense, education, and health. Why does the government instead of the market provide these goods? Which characteristics differentiate goods that are privately provided from goods that are publicly provided? How do we define public goods? The terminology might induce the conclusion that ‘public goods are good that are publicly provided as opposed to private goods which are privately provided.’ This conclusion is simply WRONG! The public or private nature of the good is an intrinsic characteristic of goods that is not related to the provider of the good Hence, it may well be that the state provides a private good or that the market provides a public good. ### In between’s Excludable and rival (depleatable)? \\(\\rightarrow\\) Private good “Club goods”: excludable but non-rivalrous (at least up to a congestion point). “Common property”: Nonexcludable but rivalrous “Somewhat” nonexcludable and/or “somewhat” nonrival: \\(\\rightarrow\\) “impure public goods.” What about? Recorded music “Information” goods (e.g., software) A national park A theatre performance Roads Clean air Education Aid to the needy Loud music coming from my window Disease control Economic research The justice system Fireworks in Disney World The 2012 Olympics in London The basic idea If a good is non-rival then additional provision is costless. Thus, if exclusion is possible, and any positive price is charged, some are deterred from consuming it this is inefficient: people who could benefit from the good, at no cost to others, will not consume it :( If a good is non-excludable it will be difficult to charge people for it many might prefer to wait for others to buy it, and then they enjoy it anyways (free-ride), which could lead to coordination problems and… Even if each person provided it for their own benefit (on the assumption that no one else would), they would typically choose too little from a social POV… Considering their own marginal benefits (and MRS) versus the price or cost, not the social marginal benefit (essentially, a positive externality) But if firms cannot charge for its full value, they might not pay the fixed costs to develop/build/provide it Who would pay to produce a film that is freely pirated/distributed? Who would pay to develop a drug that must be priced at its marginal cost? Why contribute to police protection for your village, if your neighbours will pay for it anyways? Note: Loosely, ‘rivalryness’ basically relates to whether market provision will be efficient; ‘excludability’ tells you whether firms can make some revenue from providing it, selling the same prooduced good to more than one person (or to a ‘club’ of people) 13.3.1 Application: drug development Drug R&amp;D may be a public good, or a common resource Expensive to develop and introduce a new drug – ‘sunk costs’ once developed But cheap to copy and produce; without patent protection may have \\(P=mc\\) and no ex-post profit to compensate for sunk costs \\(\\rightarrow\\) No incentive to develop drugs without patent protection guaranteeing ‘excludability’ and a limited monopoly But ex-post, patent protection is costly; drug produced for a few pennies sold for £1000’s People may not buy, or NHS may not cover \\(\\rightarrow\\) Inefficient: some consumers may value drug at £100’s, far above MC, yet they don’t consume it Possible solution: Government awards and subsidies for drug development. Note: In fact, governments do fund and subsidise R&amp;D. But there are difficulties here too. Governments may free-ride off of other governments. It is also for government to know whom to fund, hard to quantify the benefits to potential drugs, and offering ‘prizes’ to developers offers its own challenges: how to asses if the drug is good enough to deserve the prize? And too many firms working on the same drug may be wasteful. "],

But this could be counterbalanced by government redistribution Compared to perfect competition, a monopoly typically produces less output and charges a higher price Some of the consumer surplus under perfect competition is transferred to the monopolist. There is also a deadweight loss under monopoly Note: The difference in monopoly vs perfect competitive quantity … difference in price … difference in consumer surplus … difference in firm profit Note: The differences (costs, transfers) refer to the monopoly outcomes relative to perfect competition. Other criticisms: Some argue the deadweight loss (DWL) above understates the true harm of monopoly ‘Secure’ monopolies don’t innovate as much, and spend wastefully? Monopolies may expend wasteful resources (lobbying, threats, lawsuits…) to preserve barriers to entry Thus the above monopoly profits may turn into further deadweight losses!

["price-discrimination.html", "14.5 Price discrimination", " 14.5 Price discrimination Price Discrimination The practice of firms offering different prices to different consumers Or different prices for slightly different products or quantities, where the difference in price does not merely reflect cost difference, with the goal of distinguishing consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP). Note: This includes ‘volume discounts’, or offering an ‘all you can eat’ plan alongside a per-unit plan Why such a complicated price list? 14.5.1 Why do firms price discriminate? It can increase profit by ‘extracting more surplus’ from consumers In general, for a monopoly firm, the ability to identify consumers based on their WTP and charge distinct prices will increase profit However, it may increase or decrease social (consumer+producer) surplus… Consumer surplus itself may increase or decrease. 14.5.2 The alternative to price discrimination (previous analysis) Offering a single price for a good for all consumers is known as ‘uniform pricing’. This does not deal with differences amongst consumers. May force you to target a particular group, such as the wealthy, reducing your total sales. Under monopoly, this leads to a deadweight loss Price discrimination may seem counter-intuitive: ‘how can offering some consumers lower prices increase profit?’ Higher prices increase your profit per unit, but at a higher price you will sell fewer units. The more you charge the less you sell. Some groups of ‘less keen’ consumers are very sensitive to the price, and they will buy very little at a high price, so a lower price would be more profitable. Some groups of ‘more keen’ consumers will buy a lot even at a high price. They are less ‘price-sensitive’, so you want to charge them more. 14.5.3 The three types of price discrimination Individual-based (First degree; at best ‘perfect’) Note: Targeting a price at each consumer; may be done on the internet or on a discretionary basis by an individual seller. ‘Perfect’ means the seller exactly predicts and charges each consumer her valuation. Self-selection (Second degree) Note: Here the firm doesn’t know each consumer’s valuations, or is not allowed to ‘discriminate’ by charging different prices to different people Instead, it sells different bundles, quantities, or qualities of products to get high and low-value consumers to separate themselves… E.g., first-class seats. Group-based (Third degree; ‘market separation’) Note: Here the firm finds something identifiable and inherent about the consumer that is indicative of her likely valuations (and price-sensitivity). It might be her age, nationality, student-status, or even perhaps her income. 14.5.4 First-degree and/or ‘perfect’ price discrimination The firm can offer each individual a different price for each unit they purchase. Assuming you know what the consumer is willing to pay, you can make the highest possible profit; that is called ‘perfect’ price discrimination. The opposite extreme is monopoly Perfect price discrimination Charging each consumer (for each unit) the maximum he or she would be willing to pay, i.e., her valuation Here the monopolist would extract all the available surplus; no consumer surplus remains Because monopolists extracts all the possible surplus, this is efficient Because max(total value of good - cost) \\(\\rightarrow\\) max(CS+PS) But perfect PD is a rare/impossible extreme: requires mind reading Close example: Website targets an individualised price to each consumer, based on clues like time-of-day, web clicks, cookie data, IP location. But even this is not really perfect price discrimination: Note: Here, the seller does not really know exactly what the consumer is willing to pay; he is using broad clues. Note: See Shiller, B. R. (2013, or updated version). First degree price discrimination using big data. 14.5.5 Second-degree price discrimination Firm is unable to differentiate between consumers, uses quality/quantity so consumers self-select. Quality- Transport- Different classes, Supermarkets- budget products Quantity- Supermarkets- Larger quantities at lower prices per unit; i.e., ‘nonlinear pricing’ 8 oz coffee for 1.60 vs. 16 oz. for 2.00 20 p per oz vs. 12.5p per oz. (with linear pricing there would be the same price of 15p/oz.) Result: with 2 prices monopoly can get ‘high value’ consumers to buy/get more in total without losing ‘low-value’ consumers Similar with quality: Don’t know who high-valuation flyers are (wtp for travel itself varies) But may know on average that flyers with higher wtp for travel also value comfort more Make second-class seats very uncomfortable, first-class luxurious, and charge more for first-class seats Can get consumers with higher values for travel and comfort to pay more without losing lower-valuing customers NOTE: I am not going to cover the algebra nor graphical analysis of second-degree PD, nonlinear pricing, or two-part pricing 14.5.6 The ‘self-selection’ problem Train companies must price first and second class such that consumers will self-select. If first class is too expensive then the high valuing group will not choose first class If second-class is too cheap, both the high and low groups will choose second class But if second class is too expensive, the low groups will not buy a ticket. The Third-Class Carriage is a c. 1862–1864 oil on canvas painting by Honoré Daumier Lot’s of discussion of this in the media, see e.g., article in The Economist 14.5.7 Third-degree price discrimination (3dpd) / Market separation Third-degree price discrimination/Market-separation The practice of charging different prices to different groups that can be identified The firm can differentiate groups of consumers or ‘local markets’, not individuals. Each group has a different willingness to pay on average \\(\\rightarrow\\) Offer lower prices to lower-valuing groups, higher prices to higher-valuing groups Example: Students face lower prices for transport, food and other goods as they have a lower willingness to pay Remember: this is not done out of charity but to boost profits 14.5.8 Pricing under 3dpd/market separation Each group or market has it’s own demand \\(\\rightarrow\\) marginal revenue curve So set an optimising price quantity separately for each group E.g., a discount for the elderly, higher price for the middle-aged Or a lower price in Portugal than in Germany Note: Decent numerical example, slides 6-8 Here: http://people.hss.caltech.edu/~mshum/ec105/matt9.pdf Another depiction, adding demand curves (they call it ‘average revenue’): 14.5.9 Who benefits from 3DPD? Consumers in identifiable group with lower wtp face lower prices, thus they benefit Consumers in identifiable group with higher wtp face higher prices, thus they lose Firms can charge higher prices to high-wtp group without losing low-wtp group \\(\\rightarrow\\) increase profit Net welfare result: theoretically uncertain For consumers: 14.5.10 Why uncertain? When groups can be identified as ‘low and high valuation’ the high-valuation groups get charged more, and thus consume less low-valuation groups get charged less, and consume more Exchange efficiency: given what is produced, PD causes it to be consumed by people who value it relatively less! Production: On the other hand PD can lead more to be produced/consumed …of the otherwise underproduced good (rem DWL of monopoly) \\(\\rightarrow\\) top-level efficiency may increase (or decrease) E.g., if with a ‘uniform price’ only the wealthy went to a restaurant… after PD (early-bird discounts, OAP discounts, benefits discounts) the low-income may also dine in the restaurant \\(\\rightarrow\\) more value is produced These two effects trade off. Because of the negative ‘Exchange efficiency effect’, quantity produced must increase after PD for it to be beneficial Quantity increase is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. 14.5.11 But ‘arbitrage’ can foil price discrimination If, e.g., elderly who get discounts could sell the products to the middle-aged… Then middle-aged would always ask them to do this, never pay high prices Firm could no longer profit from this Similar issues with quantity discounts, or ‘web cookie’ personalised pricing So PD only ‘works’ for goods that are hard to trade, like haircuts Or where purchases are frequent and low-value, and resale markets are difficult Note: The above issues are sometimes referred to as ‘transactions costs’ 14.5.12 David’s idea: A new policy tool People with low-incomes tend to have lower-wtp for most goods Government can typically identify and verify incomes Governments could allow and encourage low-income consumers to get an ID indicating this Governments could allow and encourage firms to use this for price-discrimination Firms would increase profit Low-income households would benefit, reducing inequality Net impact on efficiency uncertain; worth investigating See the readings on this: ‘The Government may want to encourage price discrimination by income’ linked here "],

E.g., what premium are people willing to pay to buy insurance for various things, how much premium do they demand for taking on risky investments (with the same expected monetary values), and how much more do they have to be paid (on average) in jobs with variable compensation? We also run experiments with real or hypothetical payoffs to measure this. One technique is the Holt and Laury (2002) risk elicitation task: Consider, when would you choose A and when would you choose B? At what point do people switch from choosing the safe to choosing the risky lottery? This is a measure of their risk-aversion. A risk-neutral person would switch to B on the fifth choice. The later you switch, the more risk averse you reveal yourself to be. Above: Results for different ‘stake sizes’. Most people are risk-averse. People switch to the risky option later when stakes are higher. "],
["expected-utility.html", "15.5 Expected utility", " 15.5 Expected utility Note: this concept is only covered indirectly in the text Previous utility functions: predict choices under certainty No predictions for choices with uncertain probabilistic outcomes! People don’t maximise expected monetary value; tend to be risk-averse An Expected Utility (EU) framework allows for risk-aversion Assume each individual has a single ‘utility function over outcomes’ \\(u(Y)\\) over outcomes Y, (with similar properties as our regular utility function) This ‘little u’ function is similar to ‘regular’ utility, but here ‘curvature matters’ When making choices involving uncertainty, she does not (necessarily) maximise expected monetary value. Instead, she maximises ‘Expected Utility’ (EU): the sum of her (VNM) valuations ‘\\(u(\\cdot)\\)’ under each outcome weighted by the probability of each outcome … I.e., she chooses to maximise the value of her \\(u(Y)\\) function under each outcome \\(Y\\) weighted by the probability of each outcome \\(p_Y\\) By varying the \\(u(Y)\\) function we can vary the risk preference; …Risk-loving, risk neutral and risk averse individuals can all be seen as maximizing EU Consider the choice between two gambles and one ‘certainty’: Earn £1,000,000 with probability 0.1 &amp; zero with prob. 0.9 Earn £100,000 with probability 1/2 &amp; £50,000 with prob. 1/2 Earn £75,000 for certain Imagine the realised utility \\(u(y)\\) arises from the consumption chosen with income \\(y\\) This should be increasing (because of nonsatiation), thus \\(u^\\prime (y)&gt;0\\) But it mays increase at a decreasing rate, implying \\(u^{\\prime \\prime}(y)&lt; 0\\) This second assumption, called diminishing marginal utility, will imply ‘risk aversion’! Or, if the person is risk-neutral, it may be linear, thus \\(u(y) = a + by\\), thus \\(u^{\\prime \\prime}(y)=0\\) Coming back to the choice between two gambles and one ‘certainty’: \\(Y_1\\): 1,000,000 with probability 0.1 and zero with prob. 0.9 \\(Y_2\\): 100,000 with probability 0.5 and 50,000 with prob. 0.5 \\(Y_3\\): 75,000 for certain Considering each outcome from any of these… we know \\(u(1,000,000) &gt; u(100,000) &gt; u(75,000)&gt; u(50,000) &gt; u(0)\\)… but now the size of the difference in these utilities matters for your decision! Consider Y1 vs Y3: Is 1 million ‘more than ten times as good (utility-wise) as 75k?’ Y2 v Y3: Relative to 75k, does an additional 25k yield a utility gain worth the (equally probable) loss of 25k? Illustration: Why the ‘size of the difference in u(y) matters’ when dealing with uncertainty. Suppose there is open-enrollment in Oxford, Bristol, Plymouth. \\(\\rightarrow\\) Here I only need to know the ranking of utilities of each to know your choices. If you choose Oxford over Bristol, even though Oxford costs more, I can infer that for you \\(U(Oxford)&gt;U(Bristol)\\) Now, in contrast suppose the policy is A. Rank Oxford over Bristol and you have a 25% chance of getting into either, and a 50% chance of Plymouth. B. Rank Bristol highest and you have a 100% chance of getting into Bristol. Now even if your preferences are Oxford \\(\\succ\\) Bristol \\(\\succ\\) Plymouth, I don’t know if you will choose A or B; I would need to know the strength of your preferences. This means that if I observe you choose ‘option A’ I have learned more about your utility than I learned under open enrollment. I have learned that your preference for Oxford over Bristol is “stronger” than your preference for Bristol over Plymouth. The EU framework predicts that she chooses the option that maximizes the sum of ‘probabilities \\(\\times\\) realised utilities \\(u(Y)\\) of each outcome \\(Y\\)’. For a two-outcome case: \\[EU = (1-p) u(Y_\\ell) + p u(Y_h)\\] … where \\(p\\) is the probability of the higher income \\(Y_h\\) and \\(Y_\\ell\\) is the lower income. G1: 1,000,000 with probability 0.1 and 0 with prob. 0.9 G2: 100,000 with probability 0.5 &amp; 50,000 with prob. 0.5 G3: 75,000 for certain For the three gambles above: \\[EU(G_1)=0.1 \\times u(1,000,000) + 0.9 \\times u(0)\\] \\[EU(G_2)= 0.5 \\times u(100,000) + 0.5 \\times u(50,000)\\] \\[EU(G_3)= u(75,000)\\] If she is risk neutral, she will choose the first gamble (why?) Ans: If she is risk averse, she will definitely prefer gamble 3 over gamble 2 Ans: It has the same expected monetary value, £75,000, but involves less risk (no risk) If she is risk averse, she might prefer gamble 2 over gamble 1, but it depends how risk averse she is "],

My returns will then have what we call a “binomial distribution”. There is a nice illustration of binomial distributions If I bet all 1000 in a single flip, there is a 50% chance I will lose my entire investment. If I bet 500 on two flips, there is only a 25% chance I will lose my entire investment (also reduces chance of doubling by 25%). The expected value is the same (0); thus this is better if you are risk averse. “Less risky”: B and A overlap with 0.5 probability; the remaining 50% of time A’s outcomes are more extreme. So it is less risky in a very general sense. If I bet 100 each in ten flips, there is a 38% chance that I will lose 20% or more of my investment. If instead, I bet it on 1000 coin flips, betting 1 on each, there is only 6.00% chance I will lose 5% of my investment or more, and only 1/10th of 1% chance that I will lose 10% of my investment or more. Result: The more I can do this “diversification”, the less risk I face. Note: For simplicity, these examples have a ‘fair coin flip’, zero expected-return investment. But you might be wondering: ‘why invest at all? Answer: Because this principle also applies to ’unfair coin flips’. E.g., investments in the stock market are more profitable on average than money under the mattress Each £1 invested in shares has a higher expected return, but also a higher risk. However by spreading across many different assets we can reduce this risk, as seen above 15.8.2 Example Suppose you have 35,000 and must invest 15,000 in an Oil company or a Transportation company A share in each firm costs 1. (Alternatively, suppose it costs 0.9, so on average it is profitable) At the end of the year there is a 50:50 chance that the share price will rise to £2 and a 50:50 chance it will fall to 0. If you put all your money in one company there is a 50% chance you will end up with £20,000 and a 50% chance you end up with 50,000 Your expected value is 35,000 If you put half in each company your income has a 25% chance of each of the following values: Same expected value, but it is ‘better’ How do we know it is better (for a risk-averse person)? Less risk with same EV: 50% of the time (when oil and transit go in opposite directions) you’ve less gain or loss than before. I.e., comparing the distribution of returns to the undiversified investment: 25% of the time you gain 0 rather than gaining 15K (leaving you with £35k rather than 50k) 25% of the time you gain 0 rather than losing 15K (leaving you with 35k rather than 20k) The remaining 50% of the time (when both rise or both fall) is similar to the remaining 50% of the time under the undiversified investment See the benefit graphically (next) Notes: This depicts the average of 2 EUs (when B does poorly, when B does well) each of which average the utility over 2 outcomes (A does poorly, A does well). The average of the average of these exceeds the average of the utility of 2 extreme outcomes. This takes some time to interpret; have a think about it, it is not easy. "],

Duration: the longer the better – a longer duration brings a greater chance that the price will rise above strike price (£500) Note that the results for ‘right to sell = call options’ are similar, just replace the words ‘buy’ with ‘sell’ and reverse the directions (‘rise’ with ’fall), etc. Ans: 1. The airline could buy call options (rights to buy at a price) for oil and gas company shares, or for oil and gas commodity units. 2. The pilot could buy put options (rights to sell at a price) in the airline she works for; if the airline shares become worthless these put options will be very valuable.

Vote (clickers): A. Wife: Ballet, Husband: Box B. Wife: Ballet, Husband: Ballet C. Wife: Box, Husband: Ballet D. Wife: Box, Husband: Box Note: Remember, it’s a one-shot game … unrealistic within a marriage of course The wife has two strategies: Ballet or Boxing The husband has four contingent strategies, but we focus on what he will do in each of his two possible ‘decision nodes’ Notes: Here we see there is a ‘first-mover advantage’. We see a very similar strategic concern in other contexts, including ‘which firm enters a market first’. Suppose that if two firms are in a market there will be a price war with consumers as well as a bidding up of input prices and salaries, and both will lose money. Perhaps by being the first firm to enter I ‘scare off the other firm’ and I can keep the profits. The other firm may ‘threaten to enter’ but that would seem to be a non-credible threat! On the other hand, suppose that I know that if I enter first the other firm can ‘learn from my mistakes’ and free-ride off my innovation. Here we would have a ‘second-mover advantage’; but in such a game a BWI may lead to the outcome ‘neither firm enters’! These concerns also apply to politics, and the games can of course include multiple players Cameron’s decision to allow a referendum, followed by politician’s (Boris etc) decisions to choose a side? May’s negotiations with the EU (Barnier), followed by the parliament’s ‘meaningful vote’, followed by ?? US Supreme court fight over Brett Kavanaugh, the sequential decisions of the last ‘swing’ senators Proper subgame Part of the game tree including an initial decision not connected to another (in an oval or dashed lines) and everything branching out below it.

You can solve for this with ‘backwards induction’ (BWI) Solve for best move for last decision node (proper subgame) Given these, solve for best response for previous decision node Etc.

Similarly for player 2: \\[U_2(Y_2,Y_1) = Y_2 - |Y_1-Y_2|\\] Here each player gains 1 unit of utility for each pound they earn, but loses a unit of utility for every pound of difference between the payoffs. Notes: Here if earnings are equal, real payoffs are the same as earnings; 0,0 or 5,5 Where earnings are unequal, player-1 gets 9 and player-2 gets 1 from material payoffs. But because of a difference of 8 in earnings, both players lose 8 in psychological payoffs so the net real payoffs if player-1 offered 1 and 2 accepted would be 9-8=1 for player-1 and 1-8=-7 for player-2. Using BWI here we see the subgame perfect NE will be that player-1 offers 5 and player-2 accepts. ‘Envy payoffs’ Notes: Here we assume because of ‘envy’, real payoffs equal material payoffs minus the difference in payoffs for the player with lower payoffs only. For the outcomes considered, only player-2’s payoffs are adjusted from the material payoffs; she gets 1-8 = -7 from accepting an offer of 1; her payoff is 1 but she loses 7 in envy.

Because my reference point may change. Suppose I’ve 50k income and a potential 50k bonus with 50% probability Before winning my reference consumption may be the EV, 75k So a conditional donation to donate 10k if I have a total income+bonus of 100k may not seem like a loss But after I win the bonus, my new reference consumption may be 100k So each pound donated might feel like a loss What do you think happens when you ask people to donate either Before-conditionally or After winning a prize or bonus? Do they commit more ‘before’ than they give ‘after’, or vice versa, or are these equivalent? 16.33.1 Field experiment One field experiment: Essex UG students Details: . \\(\\rightarrow\\) 352 valid responses with donation opportunities Before charity treatments Results: In a variety of experiments, donation incidence and amounts are often higher and never lower in the Before treatment.

Sustaining cooperation in laboratory public goods experiments: a selective survey of the literature (25 marks) In this module we discussed major ways in which behavioural economists argue that people diverge from classical assumptions. Briefly explain each of these four ways, citing some evidence (academic or anecdotal) for each. There are four general ways people diverge from classical assumptions 1. Limited cognitive ability \\(\\rightarrow\\) difficult and costly to make complex decisions It may be very costly and difficult to do the calculations that we assume are part of standard maximization. Rather than strictly finding the optimal consumption bundles, choosing the optimal number of hours to work per day, calculating the optimal investment portfolio, etc. people may use heuristics and ‘rules of thumb’. Systematically incorrect answers to simple financial literacy questions; and responses correlate with holding an extremely high interest loans. Many people state they have keep separate fixed budgets for different categories of expenditure (food, vacations, charity etc). In marketing/behavioral experiments adding more choices has sometimes been found to reduce purchases within a category. Also, adding an (unchosen) ‘largest size’ choice seen to increase consumption of the second largest choice (heuristic: ‘choose the middle option’) See also ‘taxi driver’s heuristic’ People struggle to make choices that they know are in their best long-term interest. (Evidence: see next part) Significant charitable giving (1% of UK GDP), large part of income spent on family and gifts. Rejection of positive offers in ultimatum game experiments (in various lab and naturalistic contexts). Contribution to linear public goods, cooperation in prisoners dilemmas, even in 1-shot games … People seem to act to maximise targets and avoid losses relative to reference points. For example several papers report evidence consistent with people (e.g., taxi drivers) setting ‘earnings targets’ and thus working on days when their per-hour earnings are higher (and they should know this). It can be shown that if drivers were to work fewer hours on ‘bad’ and more hours on ‘good’ days they could more money working the same number of hours, and even have less variance in a number of hours they work. This cannot be reconciled with a model maximising an unchanging utility function. (25 marks) For of the major departures above, give a of such behaviour, and briefly describe the nature of the evidence for this, and present one behavioural economics model explaining this behaviour. ‘Specific example of behaviour’ The Allais paradox offers evidence against Expected Utility maximisation (over outcomes) and in line with Loss Aversion and Prospect Theory. Scenario such as Gamble A: 89% chance win 1 mln, 10% chance win 5 mln, &amp; 1% chance win 0. Gamble B: 1 million with certainty. Gamble C: 89% chance of winning 0 and an 11% chance of winning 1 million Gamble D: a 90% chance of win 0 and 10% chance of winning 5 million. Consistently in hypothetical and incentivised experiments people tend to choose B over A and also choose D over C. : If \\(B \\succ A\\) then \\(EU(A) &gt; EU(B)\\) \\(\\rightarrow U(1m) &gt; 0.89 \\: U(1m) + 0.1 \\: U(5m) + 0.01 \\: U(0)\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(0.11 \\: U(1m) &gt; 0.1 U(5m) + 0.01 \\: U(0)\\) However, if \\(D \\succ C\\) then \\(EU(D)&gt;EU(C)\\) \\(\\rightarrow 0.9 \\: U(0) + 0.1 U(5m) &gt; 0.89 \\: U(0) + 0.11 \\: U(1m)\\) Implying \\(0.1 \\: U(5m) + 0.01 \\: U(0) &gt; 0.11 \\: U(1m)\\) Contradicting the above! ‘Describe the nature of evidence for this’ In hypothetical experiments by Kahneman and Tversky, as well in experiments with real incentives (e.g., Huck and Muller), people tend to choose B over A, and also to choose D over C. (Sometimes the same people will make of these apparently inconsistent choices but in general the differences in proportions are large enough that we can show the general pattern even if we’re only asking people to make a single choice.) ‘…and present one behavioural economics model’ Theory: People evaluate outcomes relative to . Falling below these reference points is particular costly to utility; the usual specification models utility as the some of a standard risk-averse utility function and a ’ gain-loss’ utility function. The latter is negative where some outcome (e.g., earnings) falls below a reference point; it’s slope is assumed to be greatest for ‘small losses’ and then more gradual for larger losses. In net this can make people risk seekers over a range of losses, willing to increase the risk of a large loss to reduce the risk of a small loss. The reference points themselves may change depending on the framing of the decision, on previous expectation, on unrealised states, and in general on things that are not relevant to future material outcomes of the decision. Considering A &amp; B, the ref. point may be close to 1000, as this can be had with certainty. A seems to ‘risk a costly loss of 1000’, thus may choose ‘safer’ \\(B&gt;A\\), notwithstanding its far lower EV (1000 vs 1390) Considering D &amp; C, ref. point may be close to 0, as EV’s of each are low, &amp; 0 is likeliest outcome So ‘don’t worry about losses’, choose D over C because higher EV (500 vs. 110) By the way, here are some more behavioural econ problems to practice … from Nicholson and Snyder chapter 17 (12th ed, 11th similar) 17.2: this will be especially helpful for understanding the EU basis of the Allais Paradox 17.3 (17.5) 17.7: pretty good setup for time inconsistent behaviour (17.8) - also a good setup for time inconsistency, has video solution on CourseMate 17.9 - decent for understanding loss aversion. Should say ‘would his choice change if his reference point’ (‘if’ is missing) "]
