%Additional problem set problems, suggested answers for BEEM101: Microeconomics (MSc)
[comment]: <> (101EE)

**Note:** These questions are provided for additional practice, and will not be covered in the tutorial (but you can certainly ask about them on the forum and in office hours.

They mostly come from last year's problem set.

I recommend you look over these, and make sure you understand how to solve them.


## 2.5. from NS text: Problem set, *not* covered  in tutorial

Ms. Caffeine enjoys enjoys coffee (C) and tea (T) according to the function $U (C, T) = 3C + 4T$

\textcolor{gray}{We will *not* cover this in tutorial unless there are questions. I have *not* asked this on a final or midterm, but it would be a reasonable question*}

- Parts a and b only
a. What does her utility function say about her MRS of coffee for tea? What do her indifference curves look like?


[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

###Ans:
The picture illustrates both parts of this question

\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/coffeeteapicsq2-5.png}

- To find the slope of an indifference curve set $3C + 4T = \bar{U}$ and solve for $C = \bar{U}/3 - \frac{4}{3}T$. Thus the slope of C in T is -4/3.
- The indifference curves here are straight lines with slope -4/3. Hence, the MRS is a constant 4/3. The goods are perfect substitutes.


[comment]: <> (ANSEE)


b. If coffee and tea cost \$3 each and Ms Caffeine has \$12 to spend on these products, how much coffee and tea should she buy to maximize her utility?


[comment]: <> (ANSBB)


###Ans:

- Because one unit of tea provides more utility than a unit of coffee, she will spend all of her income on tea when the prices are equal.
- In general, with perfect substitutes, choose the product for which MU/P is higher. Here $\frac{MU(C)}{P_C} = 3/3 = 1$ and $\frac{MU(T)}{P_T} = 4/3 > 1$
- Thus T = 4, C = 0

[comment]: <> (ANSEE)



##2.3. This is actually part of the problem set too, but we won't cover it in in tutorial

This is a similar question to the one above (but going a bit further), from the textbook; we will not go over parts a-c in the tutorial, but you may find it useful*

Paul derives utility only from CDs and DVDs. His utility function is
    $$U=\sqrt(CD)$$

- Parts a-c (*Note,there is a video solution to this on the Cengage web site, so we will not go over it in the tutorial*)

a. Sketch Paul's indifference curves for U=5, U=10, and U=20


[comment]: <> (ANSBB)


###Ans
To graph the indifference curves, use $U^2$ instead of U.
$U = 10$ means $U^2= 100 = C \times D$. Hence, indifference curves are hyperbolas. (Without knowing this you would have to compute and plot a lot of points).

\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/hyperbola_2-3a.png}

[comment]: <> (ANSEE)

b. Suppose Paul has \$200 to spend and that CDs cost \$5 and DVDs cost \$20. Draw Paul's budget constraint on the same graph as his indifference curves.

[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

###Ans:
- See above graph
- $200 = 5C + 20D$
- Shortcut tip: find amounts of CDs he would buy if he only bought CDs, and the amount of DVDs he could buy if he bought only DVDs and connect these points

[comment]: <> (ANSEE)

c. Suppose Paul spends all of his income on DVDs. How many can he buy and what is his utility?

[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

###Ans:
- $D=10$, $U=\sqrt 10 \times 0= 0$
    - Here each good is what might be called a 'necessity' -- you will always try to buy some of each good no matter the price

- We extend the answer to this problem to help us solve the next part: Continuing this, note $MRS=MU_C/MU_D$ in general.
- For this case we have:

  $$MRS=MU_C/MU_D=\frac{D\frac{1}{2}(CD)^{-1/2}}{C\frac{1}{2}(CD)^{-1/2}}=D/C$$

3. Inez reports that an extra banana would increase her utility by two units and an extra pear would increase her utility by six units. What is her MRS of bananas for pears that is, how many bananas would she voluntarily give up to get an extra pear? Would Philip (who reports that an extra banana yields 100 units of utility whereas an extra pear yields 400 units of utility) be willing to trade a pear to Inez at her voluntary MRS? \



[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

##Suggested answer to 3

- (At least at her current consumption...)
- Inez would be willing to give up 3 bananas (utility given up $= 3 \times 2 = 6$) to get one extra pear (utility 6 units).
    - Thus her MRS is 3

- For Phillip, giving up a pear costs him 400 units of utility; the same as 4 bananas
    - $\rightarrow$  he would only be willing to give up a pear if he would get at least 4 bananas
    - But Inez would only be willing to offer him 3 bananas for a pear. So this trade would not occur.

##4. Oscar consumes two goods, wine and cheese. His weekly income is \$500.

a. Describe Oscar's budget constraints under the following conditions:

- Wine costs \$10/bottle, cheese costs \$5/ pound;
- Wine costs \$10/bottle, cheese costs \$10/ pound;
- Wine costs \$20/bottle, cheese costs \$10/ pound;
- Wine costs \$20/bottle, cheese costs \$10/ pound, but Oscar's income increases to \$1,000/week.

b. What can you conclude by comparing the first and the last of these budget constraints? \



##7.
Most states require that you purchase automobile insurance when you buy a car. Use an indifference curve diagram to show that this mandate reduces utility for some people. What kinds of people are most likely to have their utility reduced by such a law? Why do you think that the government requires such insurance?


-  Also, problems 2.2 and 2.3 (2.3 has video) are relevant for understanding the model, although 2.2 requires graphing this nonlinear function, so it is a bit advanced (consult the text to see how this is done).

2.7 - 2.9 are good policy applications (2.7 has video)

#Problem set problems from chapter 3

## 3.1: Elizabeth M. Suburbs makes \$200 a week at her summer job and spends her entire weekly income on new running shoes and designer jeans, because these are the only two items that provide utility to her. Furthermore, Elizabeth insists that for every pair of jeans she buys, she must also buy a pair of shoes (without the shoes, the new jeans are worthless). Therefore, she buys the same number of pairs of shoes and jeans in any given week.

a. If jeans cost \$20 and shoes cost \$20, how many will Elizabeth buy of each?

[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

### Ans:
- *Assume by 'shoes' we mean 'pairs of shoes'*
- $I = 200$
- $S = J$ at optimum
- $P_S S + P_J J = 20S + 20J = 20S + 20S = 40S = 200$
    - $\rightarrow S = J = 5$
- Note these are 'perfect complements'.
- Thus, we know she always buys 'bundles' of a pair of shoes and a pair of jeans (confusing use of plurals, sorry non-native speakers).
    - Each bundle now costs \$40, and she has \$200, so she can buy 5 bundles, or 5 pairs of shoes and 5 pairs of jeans.

[comment]: <> (ANSEE)


b. Suppose that the price of jeans rises to \$30 a pair. How many shoes and jeans will she buy?


[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

### Ans:
- Solve with similar algebra as above
- Now a bundle costs $30+20=50$ so she can afford only 4 bundles
    - So she buys 4 pairs of jeans and 4 pairs of shoes

[comment]: <> (ANSEE)


c. Show your results by graphing the budget constraints from part a and part b. Also draw Elizabeth's indifference curves.


[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

### Ans:
\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/jeansshoes_perfectcomplements.png}
Elizabeth’s indifference curves are L-shaped since she gains utility only when shoes and jeans are purchased in a one to one proportion.
10 pairs of shoes and 5 pairs of jeans yield the same utility as 5 pairs of shoes and 5 pairs of jeans.

[comment]: <> (ANSEE)


d. To what effect (income or substitution) do you attribute the change in utility levels between part a and part b?


[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

### Ans:
The change from U2 to U1 is entirely attributable to the income effect. There is no substitution effect due to Elizabeth’s insistence on a fixed proportion of jeans and shoes.

- In other words, there is no way to 'substitute shoes for jeans' and maintain the same utility

[comment]: <> (ANSEE)


e. Now we look at Elizabeth's demand curve for jeans. First, calculate how many pairs of jeans she will choose to buy if jeans prices are \$30, \$20, \$10, or \$5 (holding shoe prices constant at \$20 a pair).



[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

### Ans:
The budget constraint yields:
$$20S + P_J J = 200$$

- Note $S = J$ throughout because of her preferences. Substituting this in...

$$20S + P_J S = 200$$
$$S(20+P_J)= 200$$
$$S=J=\frac{200}{20+P_J}$$

Plugging in each value of $P_J$ as asked, we see that the following choices will be made:

| $P_J$     | $S=J$       |
|-----------|-------------|
| 30        |  4          |
| 20        |  5          |
| 10        | $6+2/3$     |
| 5         |  8          |

f. Use the information from part e to graph Ms. Suburbs's demand curve for jeans.



[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

### Ans:
\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/jeansdemand.png}

- (this figure is the answer to f and to g)
- Note it is downward sloping but not linear

[comment]: <> (ANSEE)


g. Suppose that her income rises to \$300. Graph her demand curve for jeans in this new situation.



[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

###Ans: Similar calculations as for part e yield:

$$S=J=\frac{300}{20+P_J}$$

| $P_J$     | $S=J$       |
|-----------|-------------|
| 30        |  6          |
| 20        |  7.5        |
| 10        | 10          |
| 5         | 12          |

- Note with a higher income (at least in this range), more J is demanded at each price (curve $d^1$ versus $d$)
- Here J is a *normal* good

[comment]: <> (ANSEE)


h. Suppose that the price of running shoes rises to \$30 per pair. How will this affect the demand curves drawn in part b and part c?


[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

###Ans
- Redo the above calculations, but with $P_S = 30$.
- This yields the demand functions $S=J=\frac{200}{30+P_J}$
- I.e., demand for both goods shifts inward
    - Intuition: they must be bought in equal proportions, so we know they must be complements,
    - thus a rise in the price of one must reduce the quantity demanded of each

## 3.9 (11th ed): 'In Chapter 3 we introduced the concept of consumer surplus as measured by the area above market price and below an individual's demand for a good. This problem asks you to think about that concept for the market as a whole.

\

a. Consumer surplus in the market as a whole is simply the sum of the consumer surplus received by each individual consumer. Use Figure 3.12 to explain why this total consumer surplus is also given by the area under the market demand curve and above the current price.


[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/summarketdemandcurve.png}
- 'Because the market demand curve is the horizontal sum of each individual's demand curve, the total consumer surplus area will just be the sum of each individual's consumer surplus area'
    - Intuition: A vertical point on the market demand curve can be interpreted as the price *some* consumer is willing to pay for that next unit. Only one consumer can consume each unit. For each unit, someone is getting a surplus equal to the distance between the vertical value of the point on the demand curve and the market price. Thus if we add up all of the surpluses *some* consumer is getting for each unit, we get the total surplus *all* consumers get.
    - (Note: this is a simplification; there are some flaws in this logic we will not discuss here).

[comment]: <> (ANSEE)


b. Use a graph to show that the loss of consumer surplus resulting from a given price rise is greater with an inelastic demand curve than with an elastic one. Explain your result intuitively. (Hint: What is the primary reason a demand curve is elastic?)


[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

- A demand curve is elastic (or has a shallow slope, quantity changes a great deal in price) primarily because there are affordable close substitutes for the product; or because people don't value the last few units of this product much more than its price. So, when prices rise people easily switch away from the product, or just stop buying it, and it doesn't hurt them much.
- When the demand curve is inelastic (or has a steep slope), people cannot switch away so easily and value these last units a lot more than its price, hence a price rise means that they buy nearly as much of the product but pay a lot more in total. This means that as the price rises they get far lower consumer surplus from this product (because the amount they must pay moves much closer to the amount they were willing to pay, and they now have a lot less to spend on other goods).

The graph below illustrates this, but needs some explanation:

\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/addedlossofCS.png}

- Both these demand curves meet at the same quantity-price point, but $D_1$ is steeper, thus less elastic (quantity responds less to price).
- We imagine price rises from $P_1$ to $P_2$ for either demand curve (either because supply shifts, because of a price floor, or for whatever reason)
    - For each demand curve, the original consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and $P_1$
    - For each demand curve, the new consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and $P_2$
    - Thus the loss of surplus for each is the area between $P_2$, $P_1$, and the demand curve.

- For $D_2$ relative to $D_1$ there is the 'extra bit of loss' given by the shaded area.

\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/addedlossofCSa.jpg}

Before price rise:

- Consumer surplus with D1 is A+B+C+E
- CS with D2 is A+C

After price rise:

- CS with D1 is A+B; the consumer has lost C+E
- CS with D2 is A; the consumer has lost C
    - E is lost under D1 but not under D2

##Lump-sum principle (from 2016 final exam)

Explain why a `lump sum tax' (poll tax) may be more efficient than a tax on a single commodityyou.

[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Lump-sum principle: taxes where amount pays depends on behaviour/choices will distort these choices in inefficient ways
    \item A lump-sum tax can always raise the most revenue for a given utility cost (or reduce utility least for a given revenue raised)
