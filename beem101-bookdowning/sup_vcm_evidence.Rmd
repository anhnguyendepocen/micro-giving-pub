# Supplement:  Determinants of contributions in public goods games (VCMs) 

## Notes

Enrichment (optional): Chaudhuri (2011). “Sustaining cooperation in laboratory public goods experiments: a selective survey of the literature”

- Consensus of evidence (how strong?)
- Communication
- Exclude or learn

## Consensus of evidence

From Ledyard (1995), recapped in Chaudhuri (2011)

- In one-shot games, 40-60\% contributions on average
- With repeated interaction, declines over time

### What helps? {-}

- A higher Marginal Per Capita Return (MPCR) (even if it is still below 1)
        - Why?
        - Perhaps the private return and social preference benefit (fairness, altruism, etc.) are additive, and sum to a benefit above 1?
        - (Or at least they don't fully crowd each other out)

***

...What helps

- Communication, particularly "that dealing directly with the problem at hand"
    - Newer research: what aspects and types of communication help, and why?

- Why should communication help?  What do you think?
    - Does it change preferences?
    - Does it change beliefs? If so, why and what does that matter in a VCM?
    - With conditional cooperaters and reciprocal types, does it help them identify and each other?

- Communication may make people more sympathetic to one another; language is seen as one of the most critical bonds.

- In the linear VCM, does my optimal choice depend on the other(s)' choice(s)?
- What if I have fairness preferences? What if my preferences are such that 'I only want to give if the other gives'?

- But wait, how could communication help: "bad" types can make the same promises and assurances that  good types would!
    - But what if lying is costly?
    - Or it is easy to detect a lie
    - Can people detect these lies? Do we need face-to-face interaction for this?
    -* ... evidence suggests yes and maybe)

### What helps? Thresholds? {-}

A "threshold" or provision point, sometimes helps (in theory and in the lab).

. . .

Fundraisers seem to think this helps

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/1-Multiplex-Fundraising-Thermometer-Ticks-Upward-PIC.jpg")
```

***

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/raisematch.png")
```

### What helps? Thresholds? {-}

Suppose everyone in this class personally values trip to the waterslide park at 51K SKW. The trip for the whole class costs 400K SKW, and once we book it everyone in the class can go. However, unless we raise 400K no one can go.


\

We can only raise the funds through voluntary donations of 51K SKW, as the waterpark managers and bus drivers are legally and religiously bound not to accept admissions fees, only 'donations' of 50K SKW.

We discretely pass an envelope around the class and everyone decides in secret to put in, or not put in, a 50K SKW note. Donations can not be refunded (this doesn't matter so much, actually).

- Who if anyone would contribute?

- What is/are the Nash equilibria?

- Is there a dominant strategy?

. . .

In fact, there are two types of equilibria, assuming self-interest:

- No one contributes (therefore, no reason to contribute, as a single contribution makes no difference)

- Exactly 8 people contribute 50K each -- all 8 of these are best responding, as are the remaining students who don't contribute


- This transforms the strategic incentives of the game;  remember, in the linear VCM/PGG the dominant strategy is not to contribute.
    - This now becomes about 'which equilibrium do we coordinate on, if any'?; hard to separate this from social preferences

### What helps? Smaller or larger groups? {-}

- Which and why: What do you think?

- Larger groups: Harder to communicate and coordinate, less close social ties, social pressure less effective, more likely to have at least one 'bad apple'
    - But holding the MPCR (individual private return from own contribution) the constant, a larger group means each contribution yields more social benefit
    - ... so altruists (those who gain from benefiting others) would give more

- Ledyard's survey found mixed effects, a lack of evidence

- Still seems an open question: Nonsenzo et al, 2015 "Cooperation in small groups: the effect of group size"

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

```

Their simple explanation:

> In environments that are favorable to cooperation, there may be limited scope for a positive effect of group size on the already high levels of cooperation, and the negative effects of group size may be more evident.

. . .

There can always be:

- Heterogeneity: Different people are affected differently
    - The people motivated to give by larger group size may already be giving near their maximum under higher MPCR

- Nonlinearity
    - A factor like 'social benefit of contribution driven by group size' may have a smaller positive effect on my contribution when I am otherwise already contributing a lot
    - While a factor like 'seeing a single bad apple' may have a larger effect the more I otherwise contribute

Many papers, many experiments:

- 3970 papers on Google scholar with text "public goods experiment" and 1910 with "voluntary contributions mechanism"
- 758 papers on Econpapers matched one of these 2 terms

Lots of data out there, loads of money spent,  debates over interpretation, room for meta-analysis

- But difficulties in data sharing, coordinating and standardising methods, willingness to cooperate
    - $\rightarrow$ there is a collective action problem in collaborating on research into collective action problems
