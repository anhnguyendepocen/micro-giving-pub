# Supplement:  Utility from reputation and fear of losing face: Theory, experimental design exercise

Enrichment (optional): Gall and Reinstein, “Losing Face”


## Importance of reputation, evidence

Reputation *always* matters. We are never sure we are anonymous.

[comment]: <> (PRESBB)
For social species, reputation always matters, in modern life, and even more so in caveman days.
There are few real-world interactions that have no possibility of giving off signals to others.

Experiment on losing face here
[comment]: <> (PRESEE)

Now everyone take the survey here. This is for real.

[comment]: <> (PRESBB)
**TODO**
Put into survey, need to sort out matching process etc.
"In the last 10 minutes of this module, you will be taking a short quiz.
The score will be reported to the Professor, but it will not be part of your mark.
You have been randomly assigned NAME to potentially be your partner on this quiz.

If you and NAME both choose to partner with each other, you can work on the quiz jointly on the same terminal, and the Professor will only learn your joint score.
If either of you chooses not to partner, you will both work alone."

Treatment A: "Please indicate whether you would like to partner with NAME.
NAME will learn your decision after he/she made her choice, whether or not she chose to partner with you.
- YES, I would like to partner with NAME
- NO, I would rather work alone
"

Treatment B: "Please indicate whether you would like to partner with NAME. NAME will only learn your decision if she also chose to partner with you.
If he/she chose to work alone, she will not learn whether you wanted to partner with you.
- YES, I would like to partner with NAME
- NO, I would rather work alone

**Social interactions; from the playground and for life**

- Rejection sensitivity and 'flight'

    - Face-saving strategies

    - 'Friendsy'

**Labor markets**

- Employee's LoF and 'outsider/insider' identity
    - 'You can't fire me, I quit'

- Employer's LoF, 'faculty darkly muttering'

**Business transactions, etc**

- Sales: 'Call reluctance'

- Posted prices, bargaining aversion

- Credit card applications and credit ratings

- (Failed) M&A and patent-sharing negotiations; collaboration and collusion/cartel attempts

\footnote{''Call reluctance ... strikes both individuals and teams ... 'gun shy' from an onslaught of rejection

Lincoln believed it would harm the Union's military efforts

```

Teens A and B are smitten with each other but neither knows of the other’s feelings. Suppose the teachers at their school organize a dance.  The “payoff” is based on whether their advances are rebuffed or accepted.  If they both Declare,  they get positive utility but if they are Rebuffed they face humiliation (significantly negative payoff).  Rebuffing an advance slightly elevates the teen’s standing with peers.

- What is a teen’s dominant strategy, or is there no dominant strategy?

- Find the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium or equilibria
- Find the mixed strategy equilibrium

## Critiques of the evidence

- Do these experiments *replicate*?
    - Fraud
    - Publication bias
    - Sensitivity to small details of environment

- (To which environments) Are they generalizable outside the lab?

- Do they mean what the experimenters think they mean?

Harrison and Johnson: Recent attempts to measure altruism toward other players or charities suffer from a potential confound: the act of giving is typically correlated with the size of the pie left on the experimenter’s table. Altruistic acts could thus be more generous if subjects prefer that monies go toward other players, or charities, than be left on the table. On the other hand, revealed altruism could be lower if subjects are more altruistic toward the residual claimant than they are toward the agent to whom they are being asked to give. We demonstrate this point with simple laboratory experiments that derive from popular recent designs. We find a significant effect from the hypothesized confound, with revealed altruism dependent upon who is specified as the residual claimant.
