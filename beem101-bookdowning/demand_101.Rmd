## Demand functions

Previously, we considered how consumption choices determined by utility functions/indifference curves and budget constraints.  We can now consider how an individual's choice of a good  varies with  each element of her budget constraint:  for income and the price of each good.

We will refer to her 'quantity demanded of good X' function (or more simply, her 'demand function') as follows:


<br> <br> \bigskip

$$Quantity \: of \: X \: demanded = d_x(P_X, P_Y, I; preferences)$$


\

### Homogeneity {-}

Homogenous (of degree zero) (demand) function
:      A function whose outcome value does not change when *all* arguments are changed *proportionally* is *homogenous of degree zero*


<br> <br> \bigskip

$d_X(P_X,P_Y,I)$ is homogenous of degree zero in its arguments.


<br> <br> \bigskip


Multiply all prices and income by the same amount, and the *budget constraint is unchanged.*  Thus ( as preferences have not changed) consumption choices should not change either.

-  E.g., the budget constraint $P_X X + P_Y Y = I$ is the same as the budget constraint $2P_X X + 2P_Y Y = 2I$


*Intuition for this:* Graphically, the budget line and indifference curves are unchanged, so her optimization problem  is identical to the optimization problem before. The point of tangency between  an indifference curve and her budget line is the same as before.

Consider, if your income, as well as prices, were stated in pennies rather than pounds (e.g., 5 million pennies rather than £50,000), would your choices change?^[Of course not!  At least they 'should' not change;  your optimal choices would not change.  Perhaps in some specific context the way the problem is framed may affect people's choices, but that is  not what is being asked here.  Furthermore, we are considering 'normative' economics in the sense of 'what would rational optimizing agents do'?]

This relates to the puzzle of 'why should monetary policy and inflation have any real effect?'


## Response to income changes

 `r format_with_col("Q: What happens to the quantity purchased of some good as an individual's income increases?","blue")`

\

*A: Depends on whether the good is normal or inferior.*

\

(Whether it is normal or inferior depends on your preferences and the change in the slope of the indifference curves with higher income/utility, as we see below.)


<br> <br> \bigskip

### Defining a normal and inferior good {-}

Normal good
:     A good that is bought in *greater* quantities as income increases.

Inferior good
:     A good that is bought in *smaller* quantities as income increases.

```


*Consider:* Here we see more income $\rightarrow$ less expenditure on Z! (Not just 'a lesser share' but actually *less*.)

This is because the *shape* of the indifference curves changes at higher incomes in this example.
When people have a lot to spend, they want to spend it on Y and not on Z. (Again *in this example*, not in general.)

Consider, if you won the lottery how much pot noodle would you buy? Pot noodle may be like good Z  in this example.

<br> <br> \bigskip

Thinking in 3d: 'as you walk up this hill, its ridge gradually moves to the west'.

```{block2,  type='note'}
To be precise, this is *not* about wealthy people being different than poor people
nor that their taste 'changes' when they become wealthy.
We are considering the same person with higher income,
and thus the potential to choose a different bundle of goods.
Empirically, these are hard to distinguish, however.

```

`r format_with_col("Consider: all goods cannot be inferior. Why not?","blue")`^[ There are 'adding up' conditions.
You always spend all of your income. Thus, if as your income increases, you spend less on some subset of goods,
you *must* spend more on the remaining goods.]

## Substitution and income effects from a fall (or rise) in *price*

`r format_with_col("What happens to the quantity purchased of some good when the price of the good falls or rises?", "blue")`

\

*This changes both an intercept and a slope.*\

The new utility-maximizing choice is on *another* indifference curve and it is a point on that curve with a different MRS.

\

Substitution effect ('Hicksian')
:     The effect on consumption due to a change in price 'holding real income or utility constant.'


\

**More precisely**, the effect on the lowest-cost consumption bundle yielding this utility.

Note that this is the impact of price on the 'compensated' or 'Hicksian' demand.
This comes from the equivalent 'dual' problem of minimising expenditure subject to a fixed utility.

\

Income effect (of a price change)
:     The remaining effect on consumption; due to the change in purchasing power and achievable utility caused by a change in price.

Note that this is largely *conceptual*: we never *actually* observe either of these effects alone; we always observe the net effect of both. However, econometricians attempt to estimate each separately, through independent variation in income and prices.


\

This standard definition of the 'income effect' of a price change combines both of the effects we saw when looking at the impact of an income change on consumption of X.

More consumption of each good is possible, but the MRS may differ at this higher consumption and utility level.

I also present the answer to a problem set question on this on YouTube:
[Problem set 2: substitution and income effects of price change](https://youtu.be/D5mqyOnYaAU)

There are plenty  of other YouTube videos covering this online, with better production value than my videos, e.g.,

[Indifference Curves - Income and Substitution Effects for Inferior Goods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQsDCo-xVZY)

and

[Indifference Curves - Income and Substitution Effects for Normal Goods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQsDCo-xVZY&pbjreload=10)



\

Some things to remember and 'remember why':

- The SUBSTITUTION EFFECT *always* goes in the opposite direction as the price change

- The INCOME EFFECT goes in the opposite direction as the price change for a normal good

- ... But the income effect goes in the *same* direction as the price change for an inferior good

    - Thus the substitution and income effects go in the same direction for a normal good,

    - ... and they go in different directions for an inferior good.

    - For an inferior good the net effect is unknown, but usually the substitution effect dominates (but see Giffen goods below)

\

See also (in NS and other texts)

- Numerical example of response to price change

- The relative importance of substitution effects for most goods

- Substitution and income effects for inferior goods

\

## Different substitution effects of a price change

The substitution effect of a price change will depend on the utility function, i.e., on the curvature of the indifference curves at the relevant point.


- Perfect complements: There is no substitution effect, only an income effect of a price change.

- Perfect substitutes: There may be a large substitution effect -- a price change may cause a complete switch from one good (or set of goods) to another. On the other hand there may be no substitution effect for a 'small' change in price... see examples.

- In-between utility functions: depends on curvature of indifference curve at the relevant point.

```


*Above*: We see

- (Left) when goods are **perfect complements**, there is no Substitution effect of a price change. For prices $l$ and $l'$, the minimum-cost consumption that attains $U_1$ is the same point (A,B)

- (Right) When goods are **perfect substitutes**, if the price changes, to attain $U_1$ at the lowest cost we must either
  - See a complete shift to the other good, as above, if the 'better-bang-for-the-buck' product switches
  - or see no change in the consumption, if the same product remains the better 'bang for the buck'

\

```{block2,  type='note'}
Note that, for the above cases, if we consider the *combined* substitution and income effects of a price decrease in one good we will also see

- Perfect complements: some increase in the number of combinations of each good consumed, and thus greater utility

- Perfect substitutes: some increase in the amount of the original good consumed (or, if there is a switch, a larger amount of the other good than was initially affordable), and thus greater utility.
```


## The (legendary?) Giffen good


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","griffin.jpg"))
```

- If the price of a good increases, can quantity demanded actually *INCREASE*?!
    - Yes, if the good is *very* inferior,  not very substitutable,  and is a large portion of income.
    We call this case a *Giffen good*.
    - It has never been seen and documented in the wild

## More formal statements of properties of Marshallian demand

Source^[Preston, 2006; https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctp100/g021/g021lect.pdf; notation changed to agree with more standard (Jehle and Reny) notation]

Note: *bold* means 'vectors'.

\


Budget set

$$B=\{\mathbf{q} \in R^n_{+}|\mathbf{p'q} \leq I \}$$

Slopes $dq_i/dq_j|_B = -p_j/p_i$.
in
Consumer chooses $\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{p},I)\in B$; Marshallian demands.

\
The graph of $x_i(\mathbf{p},I)$ in $y$ is the 'Engel curve'.

\

*Total budget (income) elasticity:*

$$\eta_i \equiv \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial I} / \frac{x_i}{I}  = \frac{\partial ln(q_i)}{\partial ln(I)} $$

'By what percentage does consumption of i change as income changes by a small percent?'

- $\eta_i > 0$ $\rightarrow$ 'normal good', otherwise 'inferior'

\

Applying this to 'budget shares': $s_i \equiv p_i x_i/I$... noting these must add up to one: $\sum_{i=1..n}s_i=1$

- $\eta_i > 1$ $\rightarrow$ 'luxury' (budget share rises in income), otherwise 'neccessity'
\

`r format_with_col("Can you write the own price elasticity  in this notation?","blue")`^[$\epsilon_i \equiv \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial p_j} / \frac{x_i}{p_j} $]

\


### Adding-up ('aggregation') etc {-}

If an individual 'always spends all her income' then this equality must hold everywhere.  This implies a set of relationships:

- between how things *change* in response to income and price...
  -as one spends more on one good she must spend less on another

- between *shares* of expenditure and how these change.


Rewriting the budget constraint with the Marshallian demands vector $\mathbf{x}$, and imposing budget-balance (which can be proved must hold for an optimising consumer given local nonsatiation):

$$\mathbf{p'x}(\mathbf{p},I) = I$$

\

Differentiating this wrt $I$ yields **Engel aggregation**:

$$\sum_i p_i \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial I} =\sum_i \frac{p_i x_i}{I} \frac{\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial I}}{\frac{x_i}{I}} =\sum_i s_i\eta_i = 1$$

$\rightarrow$ Sum (over all goods) of 'budget share' $\times$ 'income elasticity' must add up to one.

\

Thus not all goods can be inferior ($\epsilon_i < 0$); these must be balanced by normal goods (including some luxuries, to get the average above one.)

\

Also not all goods can be luxuries ($\epsilon_i > 1$) and not all goods can be necessities ($\epsilon_i < 1$). These must balance each other out, in an expenditure-weighted sense.
\

Differentiating the 'demand budget constraint wrt some price $p_i$ yields *Cournot aggregation*:

(rem: product rule here, carried through sums )

$$x_j + \sum_i p_i \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial p_j} = 0 \rightarrow$$
The marginal change in expenditure as $j$'s price changes sums the amount of $j$ originally purchased and the sum of the prices of other goods times their responses to the price change in j.

Next we multiply this by the price of j and divide by income $I$ to get (bunch of steps here:)

$$ -s_j = \sum s_i \epsilon_{ij} $$

The budget share on j plus the sum of the budget shares of other goods multiplied by the cross-price elasticities must add up to 0. ... as the price of j increases the price-weighted consumption shares must decrease.  So, e.g., all goods cannot be Giffen.

## Some other important functions to know about (doctoral prep):

<br> <br> \bigskip


Indirect utility function: the (max) utility you can get as a function of your income and prevailing prices.

$$V(p_x,p_y,I_0)=max_{x,y}U(x,y) \text{ s.t. }  p_xx+p_yy\leq I$$

Here this is the *max* and not the *argmax* ... it's the actual *utility* level not the consumption level(s). (The consumption levels are the *Marshallian* demand.)

*We can find by solving for the utility-maximising choices, and then plugging these in to compute the utility from these.*


<br> <br> \bigskip


Expenditure function: How much income you need to to get a certain utility given prevailing prices.


$$E(p_x,p_y,U_0)=min(p_xx+p_yy) \text{ s.t. } U(x,y) \geq U_0$$

*Min* and not *argmin* ... the expenditure amount

\

Hicksian (compensated) Demand for X: The amount of X I consume in a 'minimising expenditure' bundle that yields some level of utility ($U_0$)

\

With two goods, x and y, the Hicksian demand for x is the first, 'x' element of the below ('Hicksian demand vector x,y')

$$h_{x,y}(p_x,p_y,U_0)=arg\min_{x,y} (p_xx+p_yy) \text{ s.t. } U(x,y) \geq U_0$$



*Note:*
These functions are actually used in 'structural' estimates of demand used in merger analysis, pricing, litigation consulting, etc.

\
These are 'inverses' of one another.

This is  because 'Maximise utility s.t. a budget constraint' is sort of equivalent to 'minimise expenditure s.t. attaining a particular level of utility'


<br> <br> \bigskip

### Expenditure and Indirect utility identities {-}

Look:


$$V\Big(p_x,p_y,E(p_x,p_y,U_0)\Big)=U_0$$


'My utility when I have enough income (expenditure) to give me utility $U_0$ ... is $U_0$'


<br> <br> \bigskip


*And*

$$E\Big(p_x,p_y,V(p_x,p_y,I_0)\Big)=I_0$$


'The amount I need to spend to get the utility I can achieve with income $I_0$ is $I_0$'



### Hicksian (compensated) and Marshallian (regular) identities {-}


$$h_x(p_x,p_y,U_0)=d_x(p_x,p_y,E(p_x,p_y,U_0))$$


'The amount of X I consume that yields $U_0$ at the lowest cost...

is the amount of X I would consume if I had the income that allowed me to get utility $U_0$.'


<br> <br> \bigskip


Totally differentiating these equalities allows us to relate the compensated and uncompensated *responses* to price changes.

\


The proof of Roy's identity is rather involved and uses the envelope theorem. However, I always thought I saw some intuition for it, if we rearrange it.

```{block2,  type='technote'}

What is the [Envelope theorem](https://mjo.osborne.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/tutorial/index/1/mee/t)?


```


\

How much does utility decrease when good X becomes more expensive by $\epsilon$, i.e., what is $\frac{\partial V}{\partial p_x}$?

Well, from our initial consumption point we now lose  $d_X \times \epsilon$ in spending power. The marginal deteriment of that to our utility is the same as if we had lost this in income, which hurts us at rate $\frac{\partial V}{\partial I}$.

But why is it OK to consider this 'from the initial consumption point' and not also consider the adjustment to this? I believe that comes from the Envelope theorem.

<br> <br> \bigskip

Intuition for Sheppard's Lemma is easier.  How much more do we need to spend to get the same utility if $p_x$ rises?

We must spend, at the margin, at a rate equal to our previous consumption of $x$, $h_x$. Again, we don't need to consider the adjustment to the consumption bundle in answering this *particular* question because of the envelope theorem.


## Intuition from the 'Slutsky equation'


$$\frac{\partial d_x}{\partial p_x}= \frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x} - \frac{\partial d_x}{\partial I}x$$


<br> <br> \bigskip


At the margin, the change in demand for X in response to a change in its price sums:

- The compensated change in demand (the first term); the marginal substitution effect
- the income effect multiplied by the amount of X consumed
    - because a price increase in X reduces 'remaining income' proportionally to how much X is consumed

<br> <br> \bigskip

A similar result applies to a change in *another* good's price, with similar intuition

## App 3.2: The CPI and its biases

The government (and many others) want to know 'how much less (or more) is  a pound this year than a pound in the past?'
One of the most prominent measures of this is the "consumer price index (CPI)."

The is a *very* important number: It is used for monetary policy ('inflation targeting') and for targeting many salaries and benefits. For example, my union is always raising the complaint that salaries have not risen  in line with inflation. (But  don't worry, student fees have.)

Getting this number substantially and consistently wrong  can lead to huge problems;  people may be let into poverty or the government may be led into default. However, it is hard to get this measure right.  Using the classical economics framework, we can consider what this means.


The UK uses a similar CPI measure to the USA (a change from the 'RPI' in 2003, although RPI is still used for some things). The Bank of England targets a 2\% increase in the CPI per year.^[Something to know: what has been the  inflation rate in recent years? This is an example of 'market and industry knowledge'  that employers value. True, you can look this stuff up,  but having a general sense of these things rolling around in your brain will  ground your thinking.  As an analogy,  suppose you were a mariner navigating the seven seas and you had to go online every time to remember which direction was North or South.}


*But does the CPI overstate the rate of inflation?*

It is based on a 'typical market basket' (UK: of 700 different goods and services, excluding housing, updated yearly).


**1982 vs 2019 two-good example**

We can consider this with a minimal example, using only our two favourite goods, x and y.

Suppose in 1982 the "average household" consumed $x_{82}$  units of good x and $y_{82}$ units of good y.
The  prices were $p^x_{82}$ and $p^y_{82}$ for each of these, respectively.

Now in 2019 the average household consume $x_{19}$  units of good x and $y_{19}$ units of good y.
The prices are $p^x_{19}$ and $p^y_{18}$ for each of these, respectively.

\

The expenditure (in pounds) in 1982 was thus $b_{82}$:

$$b_{82}=p^x_{82}x_{82}+p^y_{82}y_{82}$$

How much would it cost to consume the "average 1982" basket today (2019),  with today's prices? ... This is defined as $b_{19}$:

$$b_{19}=p^x_{19}x_{82}+p^y_{19}y_{82}$$


The "regular" CPI  will simply take the ratio  of these two numbers:

$$cpi_{19}=\frac{b_{19}}{b_{82}}$$


An unadjusted (Fixed-basket) CPI 'claims' you need $I'$ to be as well off in 2019. I.e., to buy *the exact same basket*, including vinyl records.\ But, as seen in the figure below, by substituting you could be as well off with the lower level of income $I''$\ (And income $I'$ would actually make you *better* off).

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","cpi_bias.png"))
```

<br> <br> \bigskip

In fact, in setting policy, the basket *is* adjusted yearly, based on a survey of consumers' spending.\ But even this is not necessarily the *right* adjustment,\ as consumers may be attaining higher or lower utility from these changes.\ The right adjustment depends on the consumers' utility functions, which are unobservable.

<br> <br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("Aside: See also new product/quality bias, and 'outlet bias'.","gray")`


*Some additional notes on this, particularly relevant for government policy*:

The index based on the fixed basket $\frac{p_1 x_0}{p_0 x_0}$ is called the Laspeyres (LP) index (where the x-terms now refer to bundles of goods consumed in periods 0 and 1). An alternative, the 'Paasche' index (PI), considers the relative cost of the *current-weighted* basket of goods, i.e., $\frac{p_1 x_1}{p_0 x_1}$.


The LP completely ignores substitution and overestimates inflation, as we discussed. If we compensate people enough so that (their consumption implies that) they could have afforded  their original basket, when we do the above calculation based on their expenditure, we find LP=1.

The PI underestimates inflation. If we compensate people enough so that the bundle they are choosing now is one they could have afforded in the *base* period, and we do this calculation, we find that PI=1. Essentially, this underestimates inflation because  assumes the substitutions people made certainly made in response to price changes them no worse off than they were before.

There is a good graphical treatment of  this at \url{policonomics.com/laspeyres-paasche/}. They demonstrate that for normal goods, when there is inflation, $LP>CV>CS>EV>PI$: the Laspeyeres adjustment overcompensates for inflation and the  Paasche adjustment undercompensates for it. These both bound the 'true' necessary adjustments according to either the compensating variation, 'maintain consumer surplus', or equivalent variation criteria.

You may find it interesting and useful to understand the difference between compensating variation and equivalent variation, and what these mean. Essentially, EV considers 'if we had held prices constant, what reduction in income would reduce her utility as much as this price increase did'.  CV asks 'after this price increase, how much income do we have to give someone to make them as well off as they were initially?' (This is the way we have mainly been thinking about it thus far.) it might seem like these amounts would be the same, but they are not the same in general (only for quasi-linear utility).

<br> <br> \bigskip

We can may also consider the ratio of actual expenses,  the 'money income index' (MI), $\frac{p_1 x_1}{p_0 x_0}$.

For an individual, we could use revealed preferences considerations to understand when the consumers better or worse off. For example, suppose that the new expenditure exceeds the cost of the old basket at the new prices, i.e., $p_1 x_1 \geq p_1 x_0$. This implies that the new basket is revealed preferred to the old basket (i.e., $x_1$ RP  to $x_0$), as the former was chosen when the latter was available. Dividing each side of the above inequality by the original money expenditure yields $MI=\frac{p_1 x_1}{p_0 x_0}\geq \frac{p_1 x_0}{p_0 x_0}=LP$. Thus, is if the money income (MI) index is at least as large as the Laspeyeres index (LP), the consumer is better off than she was before. (However, if the new basket costs *more* than the old basket at the new prices,, revealed preference tells us nothing, and we do not know whether she is better or worse off.)

By a similar consideration, if the MI is less than (or equal to) the *Paasche* Index (PI), this means the new basket at the old prices is no more expensive than the old basket at the old prices, so the latter is revealed preferred. This implies that the consumer is worse off than in the base period.

However, as the actual price indices are calculated using average models for particular groups, the comparison becomes much more complicated, unless consumers have identical preferences and incomes or identical homothetic preferences. There are whole books written about this stuff.


Considering this further, even if the CPI measure that is being used overstates true inflation. it might be justified to stick with the system people were promised, and are used to. On the other hand, getting cost-of-living-adjustments (COLA) too high will eventually bankrupt the system, as whatever is being inflated incorrectly will grow and grow geometrically to outstrip the size of the economy/tax base!

The social cost (deadweight loss, i.e., 'DWL') of taxation is greater the more taxes change 'compensated' behaviour (via the substitution effect)^[Why 'compensated' behavior?  Essentially, because taxes in general will always leave people with less effective income, causing them to change their consumption choices to reflect the new, lower indifference curves. What matters for the deadweight loss is how the taxes change their behavior at this new lower-income state. This is a fundamental issue in Public Finance/taxation.]

The most efficient tax:

- raises the most revenue for a given utility loss

- reduces utility the least for a given revenue

- ... is a 'lump-sum tax': same tax no matter what you do (including work/leisure!)

This is a rationale for the poll tax, the proposed tax that brought down Margaret Thatcher's government

*A step-by-step illustration of this is given in the [PowerPoint file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qhsl6qey0wjcfe5/utility_demand_supplement.pptx?dl=0) under 'Lump sum principle'.

Key to understanding the above example illustration: how do we see that the blue and red dot both *raise the same revenue*?

You could also compute these tax revenues algebraically and see they are the same (see footnote in NS textbook), but it is better to gain intuitive insight.

The revenue can be seen as the distance on the vertical axis, representing the value in terms of Y at the pre-tax price ratio.

This holds whether we measure it in terms of either commodity -- you just have to pick one.

The tax revenue is the difference between the individual's income and the amount he consumes; both measured in terms of one commodity only,
according to the *actual opportunity cost* of that commodity, not measured with the 'after tax price'.


Note...^[This illustration is a single example; to see that this holds generally, take Public Economics. There are some interesting and surprising results. A caveat: If you *can't* tax one good (e.g., leisure)\
 you *don't* want to tax all other goods equally.\
 In general, you want to tax goods that distort behaviour less overall.]

## An important diversion: Does Christmas gift-giving reduce welfare?


- Waldfolgel (1993), "The deadweight loss of Christmas."


Waldfogel's basic argument:

- Gift-givers will not know the recipients exact preferences, and will typically buy gifts the recipient would not themselves have purchased. This implies recipients have other items they would gain more for utility from at the same cost.

- Giving a cash gift would thus allow them to better optimize, thus put them on a higher indifference curve (higher utility).

- He depicts an indifference curve between a 'gift good' and 'other goods' and compares this to a rotation in the budget constraint to a shift outwards.

- see powerpoint; [inefficiency of a price subsidy](https://www.dropbox.com/s/13oapcmn1r9gc2x/subsidy%20illustration.pptx?dl=)

\

Waldfogel collected evidence from surveying university students, asking them to estimate/state

- the prices paid for the gifts they received
- How much they would have been willing to pay for these
- (alternately) how much they would need to be paid to part with these
- who gave the gifts

He claimed that his evidence demonstrates that students stated a significantly lower value (WTP and WTA) then the gifts were worth (87\% on average), and this gap was larger the less 'close' the giver was to the recipient'.



He argues this demonstrates a deadweight loss (DWL).


`r format_with_col("Are there flaws in his argument and his evidence?","blue")`

- Could gift-giving instead *increase* welfare?

\

Others have questioned Walfogel's empirical findings, (Solnick – Hemenway 1996; List – Shogren 1998.) instead finding a gain in value over the cost of the gifts. (Reinstein, 'The Economics of the Gift', 2014)

**Empirical critiques**

<br> <br> \bigskip

- Solnick and Hemenway highlight the non-representativeness of W's survey, and potential experimenter demand and framing issues -- these were Yale microeconomics students. They re-run a similar survey on a (claimed) more representative sample and find a very large gain in value relative to cost (value of 214\% of cost).

- The List and Shogren (1998) paper's main critique is that the Waldfogel's WTP/WTA estimates are based on a hypothetical non-incentivised survey. They ran there own surveys about material and sentimental value, and then a hypothetical and a real incentive compatible (random n'th price) auction. Putting this together they estimate a 121-135\% \textit{gain} in value relative to the cost of the gifts.

(There are other empirical papers that could also be cited)


**Alternate models**

The standard explanation for this is that gifts gain a sentimental or symbolic value. Other gains may accrue to the giver, such as the shared consumption benefits [the giver also enjoys the use of the gift, or the act of giving] and signaling benefits, or the ability to signal one’s understanding of the receiver’s tastes and needs.

- Gift-giving allows the giver to accumulate goods that cannot be purchased commercially;
- When the giver retains some use, experience, or control over the gift, she shares in the consumption of it; (and this may help solve a public goods problem)
- Considering behavioural issues such as regret aversion, gift-giving may offer overlooked efficiencies that may balance out the deadweight losses from ‘inadequate gifts’;

(From Reinstein, 'The Economics of the Gift', 2014)

***

- Also, repeated bilateral gift-giving may be a way to demonstrate and sustain trust \dots
    - Buying 'rounds' in the pub

- It can also be a way to demonstrate one's understand of the others' preferences, which itself may be of value
- a repeated 'gift economy' can substitute for market exchange in environments where trust is critical
    - Some historians have argued that a 'gift economy' evolved into the market economy

## Changes in the Price of Another Good; 'complements' or 'substitutes'

```{block2,  type='note'}
In the previous 2-good diagrams the impact of the change in $P_X$ on $Y$ was mechanical.
With a new budget constraint and a new $X$ $\rightarrow$, the individual needed to spend the remainder on $Y$. If expenditure on one good went up, expenditure on the other good must have gone down, and vice/versa.  With 3 or more goods, this need not hold.
```

\


Complements
:     If a rise in $P_X$ leads the quantity demanded of Y, $d_Y$, to decrease (and vice-versa), then goods Y and X are (gross) *complements* to one another.

*How to remember:* 'complements' go together, so the quantity-demanded response to a price change is the same for both goods
 -- the opposite direction as the price change (unless Giffen).

<br> <br> \bigskip

Substitutes
:     If a rise in $P_X$ leads $d_Y$ to increase (and vice versa), then goods Y and X are (gross) *substitutes* to one another.


```{block2,  type='tip'}
A tip on how to remember 'complements' vs 'substitutes':

'Substitutes' are competing to meet the same desires, so when you buy more of one, you tend to buy less of the other.\
Thus the quantity demanded response to a price change go in opposite directions for the two goods\
Thus, as quantity-demanded for good A typically goes in the *opposite* direction as the price of A\
... quantity demanded for a substitute good B will go in the *same* direction as the price of A.

These 'cross-price effects' include both *substitution* and *income* effects. (See NS micro quiz 3.3).;w

```

\

*More advanced...*

Cross-price *(net) substitution effects*: impact of a *compensated* change in $P_A$ on consumption of good B.

At the margin:

$$ \frac{\partial h_\ell}{\partial p_k} =  \frac{\partial d_\ell}{\partial p_k}+\frac{\partial d_\ell}{\partial I}\ell$$


<br> \bigskip


The matrix $S(P,I)$ (function of all prices, income) whose '$\ell,k$' entry is the thing above is called the *Slutsky substitution matrix*.

\

The choice axioms imply this matrix must have certain properties, such as 'Negative semi-definiteness'.

If you are estimating a demand system, if the axioms hold, then imposing this restriction will make your more estimate more efficient!

(Just one way this stuff can be *applied*. However, I have my doubts that the axioms will hold, taking behavioral economics/psychology into consideration.)

\

## Individual demand curves

- Quantity of X demanded

<br> \bigskip

$$d_X(P_X,P_Y,I; \: preferences)$$

<br> \bigskip

- 'Individual demand curve': depicts how the amount of a good an *individual* buys responds to that good's price

How do we derive this (graphically)?


We can 'map it out' by increasing $P_X$ $\rightarrow$ budget constraint shifts in $\rightarrow$.
In each case we find new point of tangency with indifference curve. We plot this in the example below (better illustrated in the PowerPoint, perhaps.)

## Shifts in an individual's demand curve

`r format_with_col("Q:  What might cause the (individual's) demand curve for a product to shift (inward or outward)?","blue")`


*Not:*

- *Not* 'a change in the price of that good'.
- *Not* a shift in the supply curve.

*Yes:*

- Change in price of complements or substitutes for that good
- Change in income
- Perhaps: Change in consumer's information, preferences,^[Note: Economists disagree as to how to consider or model changes in preferences] or other factors (weather, etc).

`r format_with_col(" I'm sure you can see how I could write a multiple-choice question about this.","gray")`

```



## Consumer surplus

Consumer surplus
:     The extra value individuals receive from consuming a good over what they pay for it.

<br> \bigskip

- What people would be willing to pay for the *right* to consume a good *at its current price* rather than not being able to buy it at all.^[In other words, if you said to a consumer 'this product will stop being produced/offered  unless you pay us enough money',  this is the maximum amount the consumer would be will be willing to pay to keep the product on the market,  at its current price.]

- The area between the demand curve and the market price

- A measure of consumer welfare, useful for policy analysis



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","cons_surplus.png"))
```


\


Also... This can be applied to the individual or market demand curve to obtain individual or total consumer surplus (although there are some technical issues with the latter).


\

```{block2,  type='technote'}

The issue is that to get consumer surplus we want to sum the value *each* consumer gets from each unit. Suppose, as we derive/assume under perfect competition, firms are pricing at the marginal cost of the final unit produced. Assume that cost varies over time, so we observe shifts in the supply curve, tracing out points on the demand curve. This allows us to estimate a market demand curve. But this demand curve (inverted) only tells us the *last* consumer's value of (willingness-to pay for) the final unit produced. We don't know how other consumers valued each of these units.","gray")`

```

Also, 'introducing a new good...'^[This concept can also be applied to measuring the value added by the introduction of a new good (see Application 3.4). This is useful to know for policy, particular in formulating subsidies for R\&D and in adjusting the CPI. It also could be used to compute damages in court cases where a firm is accused of stifling innovation.]

`r format_with_col("Note: We may skip section 'consumer surplus and utility' in lecture, but please read over it for understanding","gray")`



\


With a linear demand curve this is a triangle, which has an area that is easy to compute. More generally, this is a `definite integral'.


<br> \bigskip


$$\int_{0}^{q^\ast}p(q)-p^\ast dq $$

(where $p(q)$ is the inverse demand.

<br> \bigskip

For welfare calculations, we often want to know 'how does this integral change as we adjust some parameter'?

$\rightarrow$ See the [(more general version of) the Leibniz rule for differentiating integrals.](https://brilliant.org/wiki/differentiate-through-the-integral/), related to the 'Fundamental theorem of calculus'.




<br> \bigskip

## Market demand (function) {#mktdemand}

Market demand (or better, 'market quantity demanded')
:     The total quantity of a good or service demanded by all potential buyers

- This just sums the individual quantities demanded (at a given price)


<br> \bigskip


Market demand curve
:     Relationship between total quantity demanded of a good and its price, ceteris paribus

- Sum the individual demand curves ('horizontally' ... quantities demanded at each price)

<!--
LC: Illustrate 'sums horizontally' on visualiser if possible*
-->



Some of our previous results about individual demand also hold for market demand, while others do not, or only if we make restrictive assumptions

## Shifts in the Market Demand Curve


Shifts in the market demand curve are caused by similar things that cause individual demand curve shifts

- Increases in overall income (for normal goods)
- Reduced prices of complements, increased price of substitute
- Change in tastes

```{block2,  type='technote'}
However, the aggregate income does not have a single effect; it cannot be easily reduced to a single variable here. You can only express the demand curve as a function of aggregate income under restrictive assumptions. In general, it depends *who* gets this income. (See 'aggregation issues').
```

(In addition, the market demand curve could shift out if more consumers enter the market, e.g., because of demographic change.)

## Elasticities

`r format_with_col(" This is a fundamental mathematics concept that comes from Physics;  it's not just for Economics.","gray")`

How do we measure and compare the extent to which one thing responds to another? E.g., which is 'larger'?:

- the change in quantity demanded of oranges when the price of oranges rises or
- the change in quantity demanded of apple juice when the price of apple juice rises?

`r format_with_col("(Or the response to changes in the price of a related good, or to income.)","gray")`

Difficulty: These things are measured in different *units* and the prices have different starting values.

<br> \bigskip

**Elasticity:** the measure of the \% change in one variable brought about by a 1\% change in another variable.

- a *unitless* measure; will be the same no matter how these variables are measured.

`r format_with_col("Think of *responsiveness* when talking about elasticity. Actually it's a measure from physics having to do with rubber bands, they tell me.","gray")`


```{block2,  type='note'}

Strictly speaking we are talking about the limit of these responses, i.e., derivatives. \

The elasticity is basically the derivative of $ln(y)$ with respect to $ln(x)$; useful to know if you want to run a regression computing an elasticity, or if you want to interpret such a regression.

Actually, this, and its subtleties and interpretations  is one of the *most* important things to comprehend for empirical work!!

```

<br> \bigskip

- If a 5\% fall in the price of oranges typically results in a 10\% increase in quantity bought,
- we say that each percent fall in the price of oranges leads to an increase in sales of about 2 percent.
- I.e., the ‘‘elasticity’’ of orange sales with respect to price is about 2,

*Note that elasticities may not be constant*; they may depend on the starting point;  e.g., linear demand implies a different price elasticity at each point.

\

### Elasticities more precisely {-}

- calculate in terms of derivatives

- estimated using log transformations


\

## Price elasticity of demand

**Price elasticity of demand:**

$$e_{Q_d,p} = \frac{percent \ change \ in \ Q_d}{percent \ change \ in \ p} $$
$$  = \frac{\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}/\frac{\Delta p}{p}$$

This should always be negative (except for Giffen goods).

It is a *unitless measure* related to the slope of the demand curve.

It is *very* important for price-setting firms (more on this later).


\

**From the NS text (footnote):**

If demand happens to take the 'constant elasticity' form
$Q = ap^b$ where $b<0$, the price elasticity of demand is b.

- This elasticity is the same everywhere along such a demand curve.


- Taking logarithms of this yields $ln(q) = ln(a) + b ln(p)$

- note that elasticities are often estimated by regressing logs on logs

> 'The last time we had to increase prices (which was in 2010 when cotton prices soared) we estimated that price elasticity was around 1.1.

In the scheme of things, we think that this drag on sales is manageable and less damaging than taking a significant hit to margin.'



\

## Properties of price elasticity of demand

- Goods with many close substitutes at a similar price will be highly elastic
-  with few substitutes ...  inelastic
- Typically: more elastic in the *long run* than the short run. `r format_with_col("Q : why?","blue")`^[Ans: Over time, consumers can adjust to price changes by changing their consumption patterns. E.g., if petrol gets more expensive I can switch to a hybrid or electric car, or a bicycle.]


<br> <br> \bigskip


<!---
Todo: give more explanation here
-->

We refer to price elasticities with the following terminology:

$e_{Q,p}$ | $abs(e_{Q,p})$ | Term         |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| $< -1$    | $>1$        | Elastic      |
| $= -1$    | $=1$        | Unit Elastic |
| $> -1$    | $<1$        | Inelastic    |

`r format_with_col("Note that sometimes elasticities are expressed in absolute value terms (a positive number). It should be clear from the context.","gray")`


\

Consider an individual's  expenditure on a product.

The total expenditure (the firm's revenue from this): price $\times$ quantity


By taking the *total differential* of this  and recalling the 'multiplication rule' of derivatives...

$$E = p(q)q  = pq(p)$$
$$dE = pq'(p)dp+q(p)dp$$
$$dE/E = \frac{pq'(p)dp}{pq} +\frac{q(p)dp}{pq}$$
$$dE/E = \frac{q'(p)dp}{q} +\frac{dp}{p}$$

\

We have that for *small changes* in price, the percent *change* in total expenditure is:

**percent change in price + percent change in quantity**

\

As $e_{Q,P}$ tells you the percent change in quantity for each (small) percentage change in price, we can use this to determine the change in expenditure for a small change in price.

\

*Considering very small increases in a good's price:*


-   If the (individual's) demand is *price-elastic*,  quantity will decrease by a *larger* percentage than price increased.  Thus her expenditure (on this good) will *decline*.

-   If the (individual's) demand is *price-inelastic*,  quantity will decrease by a *smaller* percentage than price increased.  Thus her expenditure (on this good) will *increase *.

-   If the (individual's) demand is *unit-elastic* (with respect to price),  quantity will decrease by a *the same* percentage as price increased.  Thus her expenditure (on this good) will *be unchanged*.

<br> <br> \bigskip



#### Example and algebra... {-}

If price rises by 20\% and quantity demanded falls by 20\% what happens to revenue?

\

Suppose p=10 and q=10 so TR=100. Then when p=12 and q=8 TR=96. Huh? Price increased by 20\% and quantity decreased by 20\% so shouldn't TR be unchanged?  No! This only works for small changes.

\


TR is unchanged when p*q stays the same. With a change in each $\delta p$ and $\delta q$, the new revenue is

$(p+\delta p)(q+\delta q) = pq+\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q$.

\

This is the same as before if $pq=pq+\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q$, i.e., if

$\delta p q + \delta q p + \delta p \delta q=0$, i.e., if

$\delta p q + \delta p \delta q =-\delta q p$, i.e., if

$\delta p q/p + \delta p \delta q/p =-\delta q$, i.e., if

$\delta p/ \delta q (q/p) + \delta p /p =-1$, i.e., if

$-e_p +  \delta p /p = -1$

In the limit, as  $\delta p$ goes to zero, this gives us that 'unit elasticity means a small change in quantity leads to no change in revenue.'


\

**Important question/result**

`r format_with_col("Q: Suppose a firm is setting its price and selling to only one individual , and facing no  competitors. It should basically never want to set its price at a point where demand is inelastic.

 (because it would be selling fewer products but for greater total revenue.) \

[Prof. Muellbauer letter to FT](https://www.ft.com/content/4ea79d96-a4d6-11e5-a91e-162b86790c58)

> Sir, Professor Gordon Gemmill (Letters, December 14), surprisingly for a trained economist, assumes an income elasticity of demand of zero for housing: that is, that people do not demand more and better housing as they become richer. Nowhere in the world is this the case! My own empirical work demonstrates that around two-thirds of the rise in UK house prices, corrected for general inflation, since 1980 is because supply is not keeping up with income and population growth. Other drivers do exist ... The price effects of extra supply take time to build up. I agree on that. But just imagine what would happen if we did nothing more than we are now doing: population and income growth would drive prices even higher even though we already hold the record for rises in house prices since 1970 among the group of seven leading high-income countries. We need to build far more housing, in the right locations. And we need to start now.
