<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Supplement: Charitable giving – Donors response to ‘prices’ and (information about) impact and effectiveness</h1>
<p>With most goods we naturally assume that consumer choice is deeply influenced by the ‘price per unit’, which determines the consumer’s budget constraint. We have considered price-elasticity, income and substitution effects, the impact of price on revenue (expenditure), etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With charitable donations this is not so clear cut: What is the ‘price’ and what is the ‘output consumed’? This depends on what benefits the potential donors gain from giving, and how they perceive this. As charity is largely a <em>creedence good</em>, donors may not get direct and accurate feedback between the activities (outputs) and achievements (outcomes) of the these.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This chapter deals with several aspects of price and effectiveness:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prices expressed <a href="price-impact.html#price-match">matches</a> and rebates to donors/gifts</p></li>
<li><p><a href="price-impact.html#ratings">Charity ratings</a> that do not directly measure per-dollar impact (but overall governance)</p></li>
<li><p>Responses to <a href="price-impact.html#overhead">‘Overhead’</a> information, a common measure that does <em>not</em> do a good job of explaining a donor’s marginal impact on outcomes</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="price-impact.html#realimpact">Impact on (outputs and) <em>outcomes</em> per dollar; responses to scientific analytical information</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is arguably the most important measure for donors who are striving to ‘do the most good’ with their donations.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div id="price-match" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Price of giving: Impact of matches</h2>
<p>To justify a tax break, a price elasticity of 1 or greater (more elastic) is considered the ‘gold standard’.</p>
<p>Otherwise this policy leads the government to forgo more in taxes than it raises in terms of charitable contributions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are many ‘observational data’ papers on how charitable giving responds to changes in the ‘tax price’</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The results vary greatly across studies, although there is a very weak consensus around unit elasticity</p></li>
<li><p>But these are arguably ‘poorly identified’: income and tax rates tend to move together</p></li>
<li><p>And the effect of private ‘matches’ may be different</p></li>
<li><p>So we might turn to field experiments</p></li>

<h3>Huck and Rasul “Matched fundraising: Evidence from a natural field experiment,” J Public Econ 2011, Andreoni summary</h3>

<li><p>1-1 match</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Conditions:</em></p>
<p>C: Control, No mention of leadership gift
L: Leadership gift mentioned, but not match
M1: L + a 0.5 to 1 match is stated
M2: L + a 1 to 1 match is stated</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>C vs L isolate the effect of a leadership gift</p></li>
<li><p>L vs M1 and M2 isolate the effect of match</p></li>

</p>
<p><em>Findings: All the increase is due to the Leadership gift</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Matches actually have a dominating income effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher matches lower d (amount sacrificed). That is, g (amount received) is inelastic wrt p.</p></li>

Our dictators can purchase signals 26 about why the recipients are poor. We find that a third of the dictators are willing to pay money to learn more 27 about their recipient. Dictators who acquire information mostly use it to withhold resources from less- 28 preferred types, leading to a drastic decline in aggregate transfers. With endogenous information about 29 recipients, we find that all types of poor recipients are worse off. Subjects play a \$10 dictatorgame not knowing whether they are paired with a disabled recipient or with a drug user.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Charity ratings, overhead</h2>
<p>There are a few organisations that rate charities on the basis of their transparency, governance and overhead ratios. As we have argued these are not great metrics for the per-dollar <em>impact</em> of a gift. Nonetheless, we might consider Whether donors are more likely to give/give more to charities that are highly rated. This would provide evidence against the most extreme warm glow model, where donors do not care at all about how their funds are used. It’s also important to understand the workings of this ‘industry’. There are several papers providing evidence on this.</p>
<p><br />

<p><strong>Yörük, Barış K. “Charity ratings.” Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy 25.1 (2016): 195-219.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have data on charity ratings (here, from ‘Charity Navigator’) and on amounts each charity raises per year (public reporting)
<ul>
<li>Does a regression of amounts raised on the rating tell us the <em>impact</em> of the rating?</li>
<li>No! Better charities may get higher ratings and more donations because of their <em>quality</em>, not because of the rating.</li>
<li>Response: Look at <em>changes</em> in ratings/donation (fixed effect modeling)</li>
<li>But: “time-variant unobservable charity characteristics that are correlated with charitable contributions may also be correlated with the third party ratings”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But note that the ‘Charity Navigator’ gives discrete ‘star ratings’ based on a continuous score
<ul>
<li>Class: Any idea how this can help?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>“Regression discontinuity”: If we robustly control for the <em>score</em>, we can look at the effect of <em>crossing a star threshold</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Being ‘just above’ or ‘just below’ a threshold can be seen as random</p></li>
<li><p>But donors may react to the <em>stars</em> and not see the score itself; so crossing the threshold may have a large effect</p></li>

From an economic perspective, designating initial large gifts as seed money or using them to cover overhead costs is the same. Charities are interested in maximizing the total funds raised and are agnostic about whether overhead costs are cov- ered by initial donations or are shared by all donors. Consumers, however, seem to have clear, strong preferences: They want their donations to be put to “good” use—in other words, for di- rect program costs.}

<p><em>From a recent grant application …</em></p>
<p>When confronted with a “<a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/videos#pondvideo">girl drowning in a pond</a>” most people are willing to sacrifice substantial wealth to save her life. However, <a href="https://givingusa.org/giving-usa-2017-total-charitable-donations-rise-to-new-high-of-390-05-billion/">most people</a><em><a href="https://givingusa.org/giving-usa-2017-total-charitable-donations-rise-to-new-high-of-390-05-billion/">don’*t</a><a href="https://givingusa.org/giving-usa-2017-total-charitable-donations-rise-to-new-high-of-390-05-billion/">make large donations to the very poor</a>, in spite of evidence suggesting that lives can be saved <a href="https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness">for less than $10,000</a>. There is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/doing-good-better-william-macaskill-review">strong case</a> that most donations go to charities that improve well-being far less per-dollar than others. Even within the same category, more can be achieved for less: e.g., while it costs about<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5421378_The_Economic_Costs_and_Benefits_of_Dog_Guides_for_the_Blind">$40,000</a> to provide a blind person a guide dog, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/charities/The-Carter-Center/River-Blindness">each $100</a> given for mass-distribution of ivermectin may </em>prevent* 10-50 years of river-blindness. This raises two related questions: 1. “Why don’t we give more to the most effective charities and to those most in need?”, and 2. “Why are we not more efficient with our giving choices?” To address this, we must understand what drives giving choices, and how people react to the presentation of charity-effectiveness information. (NOTE: Singer, Peter. “The Singer solution to world poverty.” The New York Times Magazine 5.September (1999): 60-63.)</p>
While social science, biology and philosophy suggest a range of explanations for ineffective giving– invoking values, preferences, and biases–the discussion and evidence is scattered. There have been no systematic reviews or large projects targeting this, and limited communication across disciplines. Loewenstein and Small (2007) offer a theoretical framework, focusing on the interplay between the mental processes of “deliberation” and “sympathy”. Other (largely unpublished or non-academic) merely “lists” the evidence, typically citing a single paper for each potential channel, without evaluation.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>

<div id="what-are-these-barriers-to-effective-giving" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.2</span> What are these ’ barriers’ to effective giving?</h3>
<p>If people are motivated by ‘the extent that they can help others, and reason in a maximizing way’, the above is a puzzle. What ‘barriers’ and ‘biases’ might explain it?<br />
</p>
<p>Some of the following mechanisms may drive giving behavior" in ways that depart from “maximizing one’s impact” (for a given contribution), and might deter giving to the most effective causes. These may lead some causes to be ‘neglected’, i.e., underfunded. If we imagine a diminishing marginal impact of giving to each cause or recipient, the causes that are neglected, receiving less support, will be left with a greater marginal impact per dollar.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Barriers: a workable categorization</strong></p>
<p><img src="picsfigs/anon_donor.jpg" style="width:25.0%" /></p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>No moral-utilitarian concerns: people may simply not be ‘moral utilitarians’; they may give for other reasons (e.g., reputation; although this kicks the problem up a level; why should one’s reputation and standing be tied to charitable giving… and shouldn’t the effectiveness of such giving matter to this?)<br />
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Psychological distance,’ (lack of) awareness and consideration psychological distance/emotional arousal:</strong> Whether a cause/charity is something people are aware of, feel is important/salient, and feel close to.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="picsfigs/cultural-distance.jpg" style="width:55.0%" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Key examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spatial/Physical distance, cultural distance; parochial altruism and ingroup bias may lead some causes to be <em>neglected</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Temporal (future problems and people) may not be as salient as current problems</p></li>
<li><p>Other sorts of distance: Lower-probability events, Emotional/Affective distance (Small), experiential</p></li>
<li><p>Consistent problems aren’t as noticeable (reflected in media also)</p></li>

<!--
In a laboratory experiment, we analyze individuals’ demand for information about a donation’s welfare impact, and compare it with demand for information on recipient types and administrative costs. We find the least demand for information about aid impact, indicating that individuals either do not understand, do not trust, or do not care about the specific information we provide. Average donations increase in response to information about the recipient type and decrease in response to information about administrative costs. Information about aid impact does not significantly change average donations: donors who demand information respond positively to high impact projects and negatively to low impact projects, resulting in a zero net effect on donation levels. Our results further show that information has the same effect on donation behavior regardless of whether it is provided for free or at a cost.

This looks like an underpowered study. They can perhaps rule out an effect greater than around half of the average donation, but no more precisely.

<div class="note">
The general project is a practical one (although Bergh’s project aims to explore into specific mechanisms).
By measuring the impact of several types of efficiency information, across several contexts, we aim to produce a fairly robust picture. We expect heterogeneity and sensitivity to frames; thus results may vary, and we will carefully examine the overall picture as well as this variation in a ‘mini-meta-analysis’.
To limit various types of experimenter demand and arbitrary coherence, these experiments are <em>between</em> participant, and (largely) run in contexts where the donation is not the focus of the interaction.
We have preregistered our studies, hypotheses and analyses.
We will share all of our data to enable future reanalyses.

### Reinstein and Harms -- engaging in the ratings process (preliminary) {-}

Preliminary experimental results, ongoing experiments

- Funds from 'Giving for Impact'


- Pilot experiments run on 'Prolific Academic', piggybacked on other surveys

- Survey interface created with 'Qualtrics'

\

- Pledges and promises can promote pro-social behaviour, even where reputation is not at stake (Kerr et al., 1997; Charness and Dufwenberg, 2006).

- People may want to maintain a self-image of being consistent.

- Does asking people to rate or rank charities may indirectly and implicitly commit them to making donations?

\

Experimental setup

- Followed questions on 'charity similarity' (R1) or 'Prolific site and donation options' (R2)

- Information on two charities (AMF & GiveDirectly)
    - (i) what type of activities these charities implement,
    - (ii) how much impact they generated per dollar, in terms of lives saved for AMF and money transferred to recipients for GiveDirectly

-  asked to give a brief description of each charity.

- TREATMENT ONLY: Asked to rate the effectiveness of these two charities and  rank which  they thought had more/less impact.

- All had 1/20 chance of winning 10

    - asked to divide this between themselves and each charity

<li id="fn4"><p> Robin: I personally wouldn’t count the Cryder studies as examples of studies demonstrating that effectiveness has a positive effect on giving. There’s a fundamental difference between psychological perceptions of impact (and “tweaks” of info to make it seem more impactful to donate) versus evaluating actual evidence of effectiveness. For instance, the fact that donors are more willing to donate when a fundraiser is close to reaching a goal tells us something about how people feel about donating, but it tells us absolutely nothing about the actual effectiveness of a charity and how people process such information. Effectiveness is an attribute of the charity, not a perception of making a difference (if we reduce effectiveness to a subjective impact belief then guide dogs could also argued to be highly effective).
DR: True; But I wouldn’t say it is completely unrelated. For actual cost-effectiveness/impact information to be used to increase/improve giving we presumably need both
1. Individuals care about their own impact per $, as they perceive it (Cryder speaks to this),2. Individuals can reasonably draw conclusions about effectiveness per $ from the information properly presented, and 3. The presentation of this information does not itself substantially reduce the actualized motivation to give<a href="price-impact.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
