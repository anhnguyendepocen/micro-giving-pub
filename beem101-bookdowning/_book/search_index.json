That approach is taken in our MRes module, not in this module. (Note that exams from year before 2016 are not indicative of what you will face in this module.) This is required because of the diverse education backgrounds of the students in our programme. However, I will be including some more rigorous material, as well as state-of-the-art research, and I will give you pointers on pursuing more advanced extensions to the material. 1.2 Readings and resources This module will use a variety of resources: I will guide you through this via the ‘handout’ (really a partial online text) file. This draws heavily from several texts and other resources, including: Introduction to Economic Analysis version 2.1 by McAfee, Lewis, and Dale – available for free LINKED HERE under a Creative Commons license. Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50… older editions are fine too) A free alternative, at a similar level: Microeconomics an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine From time to time I will refer you (and draw from) another open source work that has very clear explanations: Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus by Yoram Baumann, the self-proclaimed ‘World’s First Standup Economist’ More rigorous, advanced and applied work will draw from David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here)[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/] this will give you a flavor of the PhD level micro David Autor. 14.03 Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy. Fall 2016. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare, https://ocw.mit.edu. License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA. Academic articles and working papers as well as some of my own writings… these are mentioned below *A more detailed description of the texts is given in the next section, here 1.3 This ‘handout’ online resource Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics I wrote these notes to outline all of the material you are responsible for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short amount of time we have during lecture. I don’t mean you’re simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that these notes will aim to refer to everything that you are responsible for. These notes are meant to be a complement to the textbooks and readings (and to the lectures, tutorials/problem sets and other material on the ELE) and to tie all of this together. I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in these notes. However, each year the module adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to these notes as we go along. I will try to keep you informed of any changes via the VLE forums. Notes versus slides?: These notes should include all of the slide material plus explanatory notes and enrichment material. (However, I left out some of the jokes.) I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will also try to make the slides themselves available after the lectures, even though they are redundant– these notes have everything. Some ‘markers’ and abbreviations: ‘McDL’ refers to the McAfee, Dale and Lewis text ‘NS’ refers to the Nicholson and Snyder text (usually chapters/numbering from the 12th edition is referenced; if you’re using an earlier edition, make sure the content corresponds) ‘DA’ refers to David Autor’s MIT open courseware notes for Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy ‘QMC’ refers to ‘Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus’ Text in blue usually refers to questions you should try to answer on your own (and I sometimes provide suggested answers in the footnotes. Try to answer it yourself first.) Some text is given in gray to indicate that this is a side point or a discussion. (I’m moving most of this to footnotes.) ‘Comprehension Q:’ A question you should be able to answer if you are following along. ‘T numbers’ (take these loosely please) refer to the weeks of term in which I intended to cover specific material. For example ‘T1:03 - T1:04a’ means ‘term 2 week three (both lectures) and term 2 week 4, first lecture only’ 1.4 Outline and description of module Planned syllabus, coverage: The planned module outline is below; as noted, timings may need to be adjusted, and so material may cut for time constraints. Feel free to skip over the first time you read these notes; you may want to refer to this later.

(twitter) 2.3 This module BEEM101: Microeconomics Lectures Problem sets: There are eight problem sets, each covering a specific block of material. The material in these problem sets either comes from exams or builds exam skills. Representative answers for each problem set will be given a few days after each problem set is released, or shortly before the relevant support class. Classes (AKA ‘tutorials’ AKA ‘seminars’) every fortnight (5 total) Support classes will largely focus on covering (exploring, solving, discussing) the problem sets. However, there will obviously not be time to cover every question in the tutorial. Note there are only 5 tutorials but 8 problem sets; thus, tutorials may cover problems from multiple recent problem sets. These classes are about applying material you have learned, not lecturing on it or learning it for the first time. Come ready to ask questions and participate: we aim to make these highly interactive and participatory. To really be helpful, we need to know what areas you might be struggling with and where your logic might be breaking down; thus we will either do cold calling or highly encourage all the students in these tutorials to ask and answer questions. Think of these as (especially) ‘safe spaces’; you will be judged or marked based on your performance in the support classes, and there are no dumb questions. If you have a question many of your peers probably have the same question, so asking it provides a public good. Marks Midterm, 90 minutes 35 marks Final examination: 65 marks Classes every fortnight Plus research discussion sessions in alternate weeks, if you are interested 2.3.1 Texts and resources In previous years I recommended Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50… older editions are fine too). However, you may find this to be too basic a level, as it’s meant for undergraduates. Have a look. I am now using and recommending several other free online resources instead (or in addition). Note that this is a ‘standard core’: any intermediate or advanced textbook in Microeconomics will cover most of the same material. A focal resource: Introduction to Economic Analysis - MacAffee, Lewis, Dale A ‘no-fluff’ text from an esteemed source. Covers much of this module, but the level varies somewhat throughout. Includes calculus and lots of parametric examples. Lots of great content. Lots of solved problems. I will also heavily draw on: Quantum Microeconomics; consider the version either with or without calculus An unconventional but very careful and interesting approach; my impression is that it is well organised and explained. You may like it! David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here)[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/] this will give you a flavor of the PhD level micro Microeconomics Markets, Methods &amp; Models an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine A full-fledged text covering many of the topics of this module, without calculus Intermediate microeconomics - M Walbert Illinois tutorials - click ‘tutorials’ A series of tutorials for an intermediate microeconomics module. Covers many of the topics of this module. No calculus but a lot of algebra. Lots of supplementary materials too. Principles of Economics 2e, Openstax - very well organised, but not quite ‘intermediate’, not enough maths for my taste, but may be very helpful as revision and as an additional source of explanations! Note: The module moves through select parts of textbook; coverage and order given in handout. Lectures \\(\\neq\\) everything!: Some of the text is only mentioned in lecture/handout, but you still must read &amp; learn it. On the other hand some sections of the text are skipped. Some material is covered in these handouts, or recommended readings, that is not in the text; this is clearly emphasized. All of this is laid out in this handout. 2.4 Feedback on your highly-esteemed but extremely humble lecturer We will have two ‘official’ feedback points. There will be an ‘early feedback’ survey, perhaps around week 4 or 5. This gives you a chance to give me constructive suggestions that I can adapt to during the rest of the module. For the Accelerate end-of-module feedback, you will be asked to rate me. All of these questions are seen as an evaluation of my performance specifically by the “associate dean”. You will be asked to express an opinion, from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’, on one or more questions about the quality of this module. In particular: Overall I am satisfied with the quality of the module. If at any time you think you don’t agree with any of these, please let me know how I can make it better I am not particularly a fan of the “customer service” model of education. It leads lecturers to water-down the content and hinders us from presenting challenging and engaging material. and limit your educational experience. In fact, there is in fairly compelling research that suggests that these measures are not reliable and are “poorly correlated with student learning”. 2.4.1 Responding to feedback I listen carefully to your responses and continually adjust the material and the approach. To give you the best education, I try to follow a process of Kaizen, or continual improvement. I also make changes from year-to-year, in response to your feedback. Enrichment texts (have a look at in case you are thinking of going for a PhD in economics or in doing/applying advanced microeconomic theory in your dissertation) Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extension (also by Nicholson and Snyder) somewhat more maths and formalism than NS - Intermediate Microeconomics and its applications, and some extensions (but fewer applications) Nechyba ‘Intermediate Microeconomics’ seems to be a step up from this in maths and formalism more rigorous and mathematical theory as well as good discussions of empirical and applied research is David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; referenced throughout PhD level: Jehle and Reny’s “Advanced Microeconomic Theory”, or Hal Varian’s text “Microeconomic Analysis”; Mas-Colell et al for the hardcore only 2.5 The story of this module Note: You will have seen many of these concepts before. But do you really understand them well enough to explain them to a non-economist and to apply them to a new real-world situation? And do you understand the limits and critiques of these, and how economists try to measure and test them? Asessment hint: I try to ask you questions that you would not know the answer to had you not taken this module. What would be the purpose of you simply learning ‘common sense’ or ‘conventional wisdom’ … that you already knew? If you are answering an open response/essay question by simply stating something that the average Joe sitting on a pub bench would have said, you may want to rethink the way you are answering this question. I am not designing the exams to trip you up… just to check that you have learned something. 2.5.1 1. Economic basics (weeks 1-2) In weeks one and two we will go over some of the simple tools in the economists’ kit. I will try to explain to you what we mean by ‘economic models’ and give you some examples of these which may be familiar to you. I will not go over the math tools in the lecture; you should study/revise this on your own. We will go over many of these again briefly as we apply these math tools to our economic models throughout the module. We will also start thinking about, and formalising individual decisions—over nearly all spheres of life— in a way you may not have seen before, which may even strike you as weirdly hyper-rational. Essentially, this (sometimes confusingly called ‘normative decision theory’) is the way economists typically conceive of and model people’s choices. Even though it seems to require precise optimization, perhaps to a strange extent, there are various reasonable justifications for this, and you might also see it as a benchmark… ‘Let’s understand what optimization would look like, as a starting point’. This framework is actually fairly general; it can allow all sorts of preferences (e.g., embodying ‘risk aversion’ and ‘altruism’) and wide-ranging choices. However it does imply certain ‘restrictions’: it rules out some sort of behavior that is perhaps obviously illogical. We will discuss how ‘preferences’ may define the ‘utility functions’. The ‘uility function’ is the thing that make choices in order to maximize. In the classical framework, people make choices in order to maximise the value of their utility function. Utility functions can also be expressed in terms of ‘indifference curves’ (but keep the distinction in mind; the indifference curves are not themselves the utility functions). Under this framework individuals make the ‘optimal choices’ … by making the choices that yield the maximum value of the utility functions given their constraints … in particular they have a ‘budget constraint’ that says they cannot spend more than they earn. You will learn how to derive these budget constraints and plot these on a graph, along with the indifference curves, and to interpret these diagrams. 2.5.2 2. Building the model, putting it together, examining it (weeks 3-5) ‘What determines the price and quantities exchanged in an unregulated (or ’free’) market?’ ‘Do markets yield good outcomes?’ These questions have been at the backbone of Economics for millennia, at least since Aristotle. Classical economists such as Adam Smith built-up ideas of how seemingly random and disorganized markets can yield predictable and efficient outcomes, at least under appropriate conditions. Neoclassical and modern economists (such as Alfred Marshall, David Ricardo, Leon Walras, and Paul Samuelson) have formalized these, building models involving of systems of demand and supply and general equilibrium, and have made the case for the efficiency and desirability of the free market outcomes, at least under specified conditions.1 In the second (and largest) chunk of the course, we will learn some of the essential building blocks of this model, and how they are justified and put together to yield predictions for market outcomes and ‘welfare’. In the process, we will get useful ideas and intuitions about the working of markets. We will learn how individual optimization implies a relationship between the price of a good (and the consumer’s income) and the amount a consumer chooses to purchase of that good; her individual demand curve. Adding up these individual demand curves yields the market demand curve, which describes the way the total amount of a good consumers wish to purchase depends on the market price of that good. Someone has to make this stuff, you know! We consider ‘production functions’ that map how inputs can be turned into outputs. If firms are seeking to maximize profits, then whatever output they want to produce … they will try to produce it using the combination of inputs (Capital, labor, etc.) that can do this at the lowest cost. If we know production functions and input costs, we can describe a firm’s cost of producing every amount of a particular good. Economists typically assume that firms make choices to maximize profits. (Mathematically, this ‘optimisation’, i.e., maximisation, has some things in common with the consumer optimisation of utility, so it may look familiar). Knowing their cost of production and the demand curve they will face, firms will thus choose to produce the amount that yields them the highest profit; we will explain the conditions for this. With ‘free entry/exit of firms’ we have the (ideal) situation of perfect competition. Each firm’s supply curve is added up to generate the market supply curve; we consider this in both the ‘short and long run’. We define the concepts of ‘consumer surplus’ and ‘producer surplus’; adding these yields the total value in an economy or the total ‘social welfare’. We will briefly and roughly consider the idea of an equilibrium in all markets; prices such that quantity demanded equals quantity supplied for all outputs and inputs. We will get some sense of the idea of what general ‘economic efficiency’ means. I will state and give you some intuition behind the ‘first and second welfare theorems’; the conditions under which free markets yield ‘good outcomes’, defined in a particular sense. 2.5.3 3. How the market can go wrong (and how to maybe fix it) (weeks 6-7) Notice I kept saying “under certain conditions” free markets yield good outcomes. These conditions may not hold, for various reasons. In the third chunk, we discuss two of these reasons, which lead to ‘market failures’. It is important to understand these. These (sometimes) offer a justification for government intervention, and help us understand how government can best respond. These also offer insights for business models; which ‘goods’ may be hard to provide without government subsidies, and how can we use technological innovation to capture value and reduce the extent of market failures? (Businesses may also be able to take advantage of market failures in ways that are harmful to public welfare, But I would hate to think I’m training you to do this.) Not all goods can easily be restricted to a single consumer. ‘Non-rival’ and ‘non-excludable’ goods (e.g., a fireworks display) are called public goods: these will tend to be undersupplied by the free market, as we will come to understand. We will also discuss the evidence for the private provision of these, and consider government’s ability to provide them. This is the polar opposite market structure to perfect competition; a monopoly is a single firm that exclusively dominated a particular industry. It will tend to produce less and charge more than would be socially optimal, yielding a ‘deadweight loss’ (aka ‘DWL’). ‘Price discrimination’ is (more or less) when a firm charges different prices to different consumers; this can reduce (or increase) the ‘deadweight loss’ of monopoly, as we will learn. 2.5.4 4. Extensions to the model and applications (weeks 8-10) In the final chunk we extend the model to accommodate some important aspects of the real world. We investigate the implication of these for market outcomes. We make many decisions without knowing exactly what the consequence of each choice will be. Economists typically model this using the “expected utility” framework. A warning: students often get this concept wrong, so be careful. Expected utility is not the same as ‘expected monetary value’; and this allows EU to embody risk aversion. For many decisions we make the consequences depend on what others do; we have ‘strategic interaction’. Economist usually consider this using the framework and tools of game theory. People may not actually make decisions In the hyper-rational way we have been assuming. Here we carefully consider the adaptation of some insights from Psychology to Economics, yielding ‘behavioral economics’ 2.6 The big (small) question What’s gonna be on the exam?? As noted, you are responsible for all material outlined in this handout … the syllabus + assigned readings + materials covered in lecture and tutorials. E.g., the exams may cover material only briefly mentioned in lecture, and will expect knowledge from prerequisites I try to reward broad understanding, rather than merely the ability to memorize a few formulae and definitions. So try to really know this stuff and be able to discuss it and apply it, both to algebraic/numerical examples and to real-world issues. I give you copious examples of what will be on the examinations, including practice problems at the end of each lecture, problem sets, lots of mock and sample question on the VLE, and previous examinations and midterms. 2.7 Resources I highly advise you to use the forum to ask and answer questions and make suggestions and comments. Students typically find this forum very useful. Email For specific questions comments about your degree scheme and requirements, is best to contact the Building One ‘help desk’, or the appropriate help desk for your degree. If you have a question about course material or coverage which other students will be interested in, please post this on the forum. If you email me I may respond by asking you to post this on the form. If you have a specific question that needs private attention then email me and I will try to respond. However, if it is a longer question I may ask you to come to my office hours or schedule a time to meet. Ask questions and make comments on the forum LINK, I will monitor it Please come to my office hours at least once. The more conversations we have the more you will get out of this module, and the better you will be able to communicate your ideas on the exams. Stay tuned for the ‘announcements’ Also, there is a bunch of other material on the VLE. Remember to do practice questions and formative assessments! 2.7.1 In-lecture interaction Even though our lecture time is scarce, It seems to me that to get value out of this antiquated format known as a lecture, we should have at least some interaction. Otherwise, you may as well be watching a video. Some things we may work with include: Responseware, questions, polls and ‘chat’; ‘Kahoot’ In-lecture experiments and games Remember to install Responseware on your smart phones, or get a free turningpoint clicker! Download it on app stores, or use it on a laptop the session id is ‘david’ (check) browser mode: To get the most out of the lectures, I advise you to Ask me questions, especially at beginning and end, raise both hands if you are lost Draw-along and solve-along with the slides and board work. The act of trying to construct models, solve algebra, and draw and interpret diagrams yourself really helps you understand them better and use them 2.8 How to do well Put in the work Read the handout and the relevant parts of the text (as outlined in this handout) in advance of the lecture, come with questions Handouts and lectures mainly follow the text Do the problem set questions, suggested questions and class questions, understand the answers Do the many practice problems and mock exam questions Care about the content Care about actually understanding this stuff. This will be rewarded. Don’t try to game this. It’s easier to just learn this stuff. Try to achieve Real Understanding: Be able to explain this stuff in your own words (in writing) and apply it to new situations Interact and discuss: Peers, Forum, office hours Be careful you know how to interpret the exam instructions correctly, and use your time wisely Skills to hone and build. Your success in this module will depend in large part on building and applying basic maths skills and tools (mainly at the GCSE level), and strong reading/writing/logic abilities. You should build the ability to comprehend and respond carefully and logically to nuanced questions (essay/short answer, solved problem, and multiple choice). These problem will incorporate quantitative reasoning, logic, and the ability to understand and clearly express ideas, to correctly characterise and describe theories and evidence, and to apply learned principles to new situations. This last comment is especially relevant for non-native speakers of English. 2.9 Fortune Cookie Wisdom Here are some broad Lessons that I hope you take away from this module, And that will help you throughout… I will come back to these. It may seem like we have the answers, but this is only where we have asked the questions very carefully But sometimes ignorance is bliss. Examples: Sunk-cost fallacy, gains to trade/comparative advantage, opportunity cost, free-riding/prisoners’ dilemma, double-marginalization,‘raise price to raise profit’, etc. I’ve had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife. Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out. We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a ‘single representative consumer’. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights. However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or testing these models, be careful; people may differ and they may change and they may have multiple motives. Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets \\(\\rightarrow\\) opportunities. I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse. I’m not telling you what you need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics. As I also mentioned, these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks. Here are some possible examples. Imperfection: Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘All you can eat’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for ‘all-you-can-eat’ And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later. Free-riding on public goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) Disneyworld, resorts We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride. They then charge an admission fee to ‘be inside of Disney World’ and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods. Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Uber, AirBnb Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves). Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Tinder Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high. A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit. If you’re interested, see my research on this here, presentation slides here, my research page is here. Asymmetric information, adverse selection \\(\\rightarrow\\) NHS, ‘Obamacare’ This one is a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA. Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later). There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance ( or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well. Note: Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you ‘outsource’ and when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do? 2.10 Chapter 1: Economic Models 2.10.1 What is Economics? Note: DR: It has changed. There are different views. Ask two economists, and you’ll probably get at least three answers. “Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.” “Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” Alfred Marshall Note: The first quote suggests an approach (how we do our research), the second suggests a domain (what we focus on). Note: “Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.” Ludwig von Mises 2.10.2 What is Microeconomics? The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets. Largely, using theoretical and mathematical ‘models’ that depend on strong assumptions. Comprehension Q: Consider some examples of ‘relevant choices’ for economic study. Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications. A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and ‘general’; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications. 2.11 Why learn these models? Consider the parable of the tortoise and the hare (Aesop)… One might question the realism of this story: Can hares really speak? Is this a rabbit or a hare? What other animals were racing? Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above questions? The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models. Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop’s fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of ‘Ceteris paribus’ (all other things being equal) can help us here. What do models give us? There are different views of this Via logic and mathematics: Assumptions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Results and sometimes these also yield testable predictions (if the assumptions hold) So why learn these models? A starting point (Sometimes) make concrete predictions you can test Building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking Discussion is framed around them and they are seen as a ‘baseline’ Understand the arguments and models to be able to effectively critique or extend them Some critics of what they call ‘neoliberal economics’ can be misinformed about what it is. Their criticism can sound to us mainstream economists like someone who says ‘cars are dangerous and should be banned because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping’ 2.12 Economic Models Economic model: Simple theoretical description that captures the essentials of how the economy works. Differing views on the use of economic models Instrumentalist: The Methodology of Positive Economics (Friedman): the ultimate goal of theory is to \"yield valid and meaningful … predictions about phenomena not yet observed “Simplicity” – ‘the less initial knowledge needed to make a prediction’. “Fruitful” – more precise predictions, for a wider range of situations ‘Fictionalist’ (Sugden): describes a fictional world that is credible or truthlike in something like the way that the events of a realistic novel are; the model connects with the real world by relations of similarity Are these models predictive? If not, are they useful? Reasons to model optimising behavior if it is not predictive. But good evidence for optimisation and ‘predictable irrationality’ … behavioural economics. -e.g., : - psychological costs/benefits relating to outcomes other than their own final consumption. - They may care about others’ consumption (altruism etc.), - about the way they make the decision, - and about how close they come to certain goals (‘reference points’ and ‘loss aversion’). - may realize their short-term choices are not in their lt interest, and try to constrain themselves - mentally costly to carefully calculate the costs and benefits \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘rational inattention’ -follow simple rules or ‘heuristics’ to make their decisions easier; e.g., ‘work every day until I’ve earned target income’. 2.12.1 The PPF: a ‘model’ and a way of seeing things Above, we see a depiction of the “production possibility frontier” (PPF), explained in the figure’s caption. You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced. I’m not sure if I would call it a ‘model’, but it certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions. This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now. Note: For comprehension: Draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means. See fig 1.1 Advanced: Consider … what assumptions does the PPF (implicitly) make? PPF illustrates key principles Principle 1: Scarce Resources Principle 2: Scarcity involves opportunity cost. Notes: The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it. The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone ‘next best’ opportunity from a choice. I may just call this ‘cost’ Comprehension question (advanced): Think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the ‘cost’ and the economists’ definition of an ‘opportunity cost’ On the PPF the opportunity cost of more clothing is less food. Principle 3: Opportunity costs are (often) increasing. What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases. To produce more and more clothing you would have to give up increasing amounts of food. The “law” of diminishing marginal returns. I’m somewhat sceptical of this being a ‘law’; there are certainly increasing returns in certain regions. However, you will see it again and again as it is a fairly standard assumption. You should read and consider these applications on your own. They will show how the economic principles and theory can be applied to the real-world and test and improve your understanding of the theory. 2.13 Application 1.1: Economics in the Natural world The NS textbook presents many interesting applications. These offer you the opportunity to test your knowledge and understanding and apply it to real-world situations. These can also be helpful on assessments; applications may come up, and it may be useful to refer to these and supporting your points on free answer questions. Studies of honeybees have found that they generally do not gather all of the nectar in a particular flower before moving on. Why not? What key features do modern human economies have that ‘animal economies’ don’t have? Largely: trade, prices, specialisation, free choice vs instinct. The economics of trade may also apply to the natural world in certain ways. Above, we see the working of ant-aphid symbiosis, a form of mutualism. Relevant to the ‘conditions necessary for trade to occur’? The ants ‘farm’ the aphids, who secrete nice substances. In return the ants protect the aphids and only sometimes eat them. 2.14 Application 1.2: Is It Worth Your Time to Be Here? (read at home, discuss) Consider the same for the UK/Exeter; give your best estimate How does the analysis differ from the one your uncle would do? (Advanced) questions to consider: What are the limitations to the analysis as discussed in the text? How would you estimate the ‘return’; Who should we compare? What years of data are these based on – does it tell us about future returns? Should the government subsidise it? Won’t people get the optimal education without subsidies? Consider: Social vs private returns. Is there a case for ‘market failure’? 2.15 Application 1.3: Rise and Fall of Blockbuster Critical contemporary business challenge: (Note edition 12 is updated and discusses Netflix, etc) Blockbuster and Netflix are selling what we call information goods. These have a zero marginal (distribution) cost. They are competing with online merchants. This is characteristic of many things ‘online’ In a turnabout in policy, Blockbuster agreed to give the studios a substantial share (as much as 40 percent) of the revenues from its movie rentals in exchange for price reductions of up to 90 percent. (Why) was this a good business move? Was it efficient from a social point of view? 2.16 Basic Supply-Demand Model …Describes how a good’s price and the quantity exchanged are determined Determined by the preferences, behaviour, and costs of potential buyers and sellers Note: in 2019 we will not be covering the historical background to the Marshallian cross (the demand and supply you may be familiar with). However, I do expect you to understand this model itself. 2.17 Historical background * And now, some pictures of founding fathers: Adam Smith David Ricardo Alfred Marshall Adam Smith and the Invisible Hand Prices: not random nor morally determined (see earlier Christian philosophers on the ‘Fair price’); Adam Smith conceived of prices as signals to direct resources, reflecting the ‘worth’ of goods He formulated a labour-cost-based theory of prices Claim: If it takes twice as long for a hunter to catch a deer as to catch a beaver, one deer should trade for two beavers. Argument: If it were trading at any other price (say 1-1), no one would hunt a deer, they would just hunt a beaver and trade it for a deer; so that can’t be the prevailing price. Why/when should this not hold? One reason is that labour is not always the only input. Also, this ‘time ratio’ may depend on the quantity of each that are supplied … diminishing returns. And hunters may differ in skill. Farmland was expanding in England … as new and less fertile land was brought into use, it would naturally take more labor … to produce an extra bushel of grain. Ricardo: Diminishing returns: the cost of producing one more unit of good A (here, food)—in terms of other goods foregone—rises as more of A is produced Explains why a supply curve might slope upwards (produce more \\(\\rightarrow\\) costs more \\(\\rightarrow\\) higher price necessary) Left unexplained: How much is produced, thus ‘what is the price?’ Some key points: Ricardo’s model is inconsistent with the falling prices that occurred during the 19th century. These were ‘Falling prices’ in terms of goods purchased per unit of labour (leisure foregone). However, the Marshallian cross also doesn’t explain it without a further understanding of technological change. 2.18 Marshall’s Model of Supply and Demand Economists and philosophers have long sought to explain ‘what determines the prices, and why do they change the way they do?’ In the 19th century UK prices were falling while quantities were increasing; this was a puzzle. Alfred Marshall argued that a good’s price must equal both the cost to produce and the value (to consumers) of the last unit produced and consumed. He introduced the ‘demand curve’; with a downward slope. This slope was justified by ‘satiation’: for an individual, additional units of a good are usually valued less and less. For example, you might be willing to pay thousands of pounds to be able to access 100 gallons of water rather than no water at all, but if you already have access to a thousand gallons of water, you will not be willing to pay very much for an additional 100 gallons. Furthermore, firms must cater to less and less keen consumers as they wants to sell more and more units. We come back to this later in the module. ‘Willingness to pay’ (wtp) becomes less and less for the next unit purchased, so will buy more only at a lower price. Equivalently, at a lower price more people find the value exceeds the price, and for additional units. Note that we will also return to these questions in more depth in later chapters as we build up the demand and supply curves. With ‘single crossing’ (a fancy condition you can ignore in this module) there is a unique price where \\(Q^s(p)=Q^d(p)\\), and a unique quantity where the last unit’s value to the consumer equals its cost to produce. Scissors analogy The equilibrium model is analogised to a pair of scissors; neither scis cuts alone So don’t ask ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged’? Understand why ‘Just like neither scis cuts alone, neither the supply nor the demand curve determines the equilibrium price and quantity in isolation’? Consider: What does it mean to be at equilibrium, and how do we get there? Draw: the famous Marshallian cross Can you explain? The inefficiency of any price other than where \\(Q^D(p)=Q^S(p)\\)? If the price was set at a different value, what forces might push it to the equilibrium? Suggested ans: To economists, a ‘shortage’ is where, at the prevailing or imposed price, consumers are willing to buy more than is available. Some consumers get value from the good in excess of the price. In such a case, firms might offer a higher price, or sellers might ask for a higher price. The price rise would reduce quantity demanded (not ‘reduce demand’) and increase quantity supplied (not ‘reduce supply’). Harder question: Who gains or suffers with a government-imposed price floor/ceiling? To respect yourself in the morning, you must know Which factors cause the supply and demand curves to shift? What causes ‘movements along’ the supply or demand curve? Note: Caveat, to avoid later confusion: These models assume ‘price-taking’; neither buyers nor sellers consider the impact of their choices on prices 2.19 How Economists ‘Verify’ (or Assess) Theoretical Models This will be skipped in lecture, but we will come back to some of these ideas later. Two methods: Testing Assumptions ‘Verifying’ economic models by examining validity of assumptions upon which models are based. Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.? DR: ‘Verifying’ is a bit too black and white’; all models have limitations. Note: Testing Predictions Note: Verifying economic models by asking whether models can accurately predict real-world events. If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid. DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general. 2.20 Positive and normative What’s the difference between the following two statements? “An increase in the minimum wage leads to greater unemployment.” “We should reduce the minimum wage, to lessen unemployment” The first is a positive statement: it looks at “what is” The second is a normative statement: it looks at “what should be” Previous slides had the first statement as ‘We should increase the minimum wage to help low income workers.’ Consider: why do I think this was not a good parallel? Note: We will mainly focus on positive statements. However, you are not forbidden from making normative statements, and positive results are useful in making normative judgements. But we should try to be clear which type of statement we are making. Still, much economic research has both positive and normative interpretations and implications. Some economists work on ways of clearly defining and quantifying preferences over social outcomes. Others work on determining determining ‘how to optimise’, with implications for which policies and decisions (for individuals, firms, governments, and nonprofits) will be most efficient and effective at attaining particular goals. 2.21 APPLICATION 1.4: Economics According to Bono This will be skipped in lecture, but please read it; it may come up on an exam. Do US farm subsidies help or hurt Africans in net? Think about: what do we mean ‘in net’? No obvious theoretical or empirical answers Microeconomic theory helps us consider it, and look for answers Should hurt African farmers Should help African consumers … Which effect dominates (change in African profit less change in African consumer surplus)? … Note: Fig. 1 in text depicts African supply/demand mapped against world price 2.22 Review questions and problems from Chapter 1 Note: The ‘review questions’ are fundamental, thought-provoking, and challenging; don’t expect an easy answer! Questions/problems I liked are: Q6. ‘‘Gasoline sells for $4.00 per gallon this year, and it sold for $3.00 per gallon last year. But consumers bought more gasoline this year than they did last year. This is clear proof that the economic theory that people buy less when the price rises is incorrect.’’ Do you agree? Explain. Q8. (This one is conceptual and somewhat tricky!) ‘’Housing advocates often claim that ‘‘the demand for affordable housing vastly exceeds the supply. Use a supply-demand diagram to show whether you can make any sense out of this statement. In particular, show how a proper interpretation may depend on precisely how the word affordable is to be defined.’’ Note: Some questions on the above material will be covered in the first problem set and the tutorial; see VLE links. Be sure that you can do problems like 1.1 in the N&amp;S text without difficulty; I won’t cover this but it should be easy for you. Let me know if you have difficulties. For 1.1.C, note that for the supply curve, quantity supplied is never negative – below a certain price, it will just be zero. comment: &lt;&gt; (101EE) 2.23 Chapter 1a – coverage outline All of these maths tools should be straightforward for you. If not, you need to revise them very carefully! We will not cover these in lecture. In addition, I’ve charted some of the key maths concepts from BEEM103: L1 Unions and intersections Open and closed sets (for more advanced prep) Sets: the feasible consumption set and the budget set (latter contained within the former) Geometric series (discounting future payoffs) Sign diagrams (esp. if we get to mechanism design/principal-agent aspect of asymmetric information) And obviously the rules of basic algebra etc L2 Simultaneous equations e.g., supply and demand; considering exogenous and endogenous variables nonlinear equations (broadly) Sets of linear equations and matrix methods (for those going further into multi-good demand systems, etc) Functions of one variable, domain, range, graphing natural logarithm power functions (for exploring more advanced concepts like CES utility) Elasticity! Goals of this material: Give a flavour of what empirical microeconomics is and you a sense of some of the key issues in empirical work Covers: Nicholson/Snyder Chapter 1a: Mathematics used in Microeconomics 2.24 Simple stuff Please note: if this depiction is too abbreviated, please consult the NS text, or the Khan academy and Warwick resources mentioned above! (Univariate) Function A ‘map’ from one or more variables (\\(x\\)) (or ‘variables’) to an outcome (\\(y=f(x)\\)) for each value of \\(x\\) the function tells you a single value of \\(f(x)\\); typically we assign \\(y=f(x)\\) Note: ‘Variables’ are more formally called the ‘arguments’ of a function Linear function A function of the form \\(y=a+bX\\); e.g., \\(y = f(x) = -10 + 3x\\) Plotted as a straight line; intercept \\(a\\), constant slope \\(b\\) (Technically this is an ‘affine’ function; a linear function doesn’t have an intercept) Adv, Maths: For strictly linear functions (not including functions with constants) \\(f(a X_1 + b X_2) = a f(X_1) + b f(X_2)\\) for any values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) In particular ‘the function of the average is the average of the functions’ (this also holds for affine functions). This does not hold in general for nonlinear functions. Slope of \\(y = f(x)\\) The change in y for a given change in x. ‘Rise over run’. Arc slope: slope over a range Point slope: slope of the tangent to a curve at a point Nonlinear (univariate) function : A function \\(f(x)\\) of a form other than \\(f(x) = y=a+bX\\); E.g., a quadratic function \\(y = f(x) = a + bx + cx^2\\) E,g, \\(y = f(x) = 10 - 2x + 3x^2\\) Or a logarithmic \\(y=ln(x)\\) or exponential function \\(y = exp(x)\\) Note: I will try to limit things to linear and quadratic functions, and possibly exponential and log functions. I will remind you of the rules for dealing with these whenever it is necessary. For linear functions the slope is the same at any point. For nonlinear functions it may differ at each point. Think of the slope of a mountain versus the slope of a wheelchair ramp. The point here is that increasing X by 1 has the same effect on Y wherever you start, for a linear function but a different effect depending on where you start for a nonlinear function Instantaneous rate of change (instantaneous slope) The slope of the line tangent to the curve at a single point Adv, Math: This is the limit of the ‘rise over run’ as the run goes to zero Convex function: Slope everywhere increasing, unique minimum where slope \\(=0\\) Concave function: Slope everywhere decreasing, unique maximum where slope \\(=0\\) Note: we are referring to the signed value of the slope here, not the absolute value. E.g., for the convex case depicted, it goes from a negative slope to a zero slope to a positive slope For these functions the slope is different at each point. Note: We will mainly deal with functions like these, with a single minimum or maximum that occurs at the unique point with slope zero. Quadratic function are convex if the \\(x^2\\) term has a positive sign and concave if it has a negative sign. That’s because at extreme values of x the term with the largest exponent will dominate all other terms. Example of a convex function: Tiger’s golf earnings per game as function of hours of golf retraining… he had to get worse before he could get better, they say. Or cost per smoothie as function of employees behind smoothie counter. One example of a concave function: how funny I am as function of beers I drink (on the other hand, how funny I think I am may be an everywhere increasing function. Derivative of a function A derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) is another function called \\(f&#39;(x)\\). \\(f&#39;(x)\\) tells us the slope of the function \\(f(x)\\) at any point \\(x\\). For example, the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2\\) For this linear function the slope is a constant, 2 E.g., the derivative of the quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2x - 4\\) derivative of the quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2x - 4\\) E.g., the slope at \\(x=1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x;x=1) = 1*1 - 4 = -2\\) The slope is zero where \\(f&#39;(x)=2x-4=0\\), or where \\(x=2\\) Is \\(x=2\\) at a min, a max, or neither? How do we know? In case you are interested, the R code to do this graph is below. I’m learning R myself. fun1p &lt;-function(x) 2*x -4 fun1 &lt;-function(x) x * x - 4*x+1 plot(fun1p,-.5,5,asp=1,xlim=c(-2,3),ylim=c(-3,4)) plot(fun1,-.5,5,asp=1,xlim=c(-2,3),ylim=c(-3,4),add=TRUE) abline(h=-1:3, v=-3:3, col=&quot;gray&quot;, lty=3) abline(h=0,v=0) 2.25 Minimum, maximum, or neither? \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is a function that tells us the slope of \\(f(x)\\), or how \\(f(x)\\) changes in \\(x\\) at any point \\(x\\) In turn, the derivative of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is called \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\). This tells us how the slope changes as \\(x\\) increases Oversimplifying a bit: (Adv, Math: Essentially, for a class of functions where the domain is not bounded) if the slope is always increasing, i.e., if \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) everywhere, the function is convex (u-shaped), and has a single minimum where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) if the slope is always decreasing, i.e., if \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) everywhere, the function is concave (inverse-u-shaped), and has a single maximum where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) 2.26 Functions of two or more variables (multivariate functions) Utility, profit, cost, production, returns, etc. May depend on multiple variables/inputs Need to illustrate tradeoffs between these \\[y=f(x,z)\\] \\(y\\) may increase and/or decrease in \\(x\\) and in \\(z\\) The rate of increase of y in \\(x\\) may depend on the values of \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) Similar for the rate of increase of y in z E.g., \\[y=\\sqrt(xz) = x^{1/2}z^{1/2}, x \\geq 0, z \\geq 0\\] Note the outcome will increase in each argument at a decreasing rate. What does it look like? 3d: project up to y from a “map” of x and z coordinates on the desk. This is hard to picture; ‘contour lines’ can help. Projecting a function up from X,Y space into the Z axis: 2.27 Contour lines (we will come back to this later) Contour lines Level sets - depict combinations of variables that hold the function constant at a particular value f(x,z) = A for some value \\(A\\) Level sets: E.g., indifference curves, isoquants and isocost curves. Don’t worry if you find this discussion of level sets confusing. We will come back to it later in the module for a more specific case. Note: It is difficult to depict more than 2 dimensions on a piece of paper. So we find the values for the 2 variables that give us a particular value for the third … which tells us how these trade off. Consider a production function: \\[Y = f(K,L) = \\sqrt(KL)\\] Setting this equal to 1 we can map out ‘all combinations of K and L that produce output \\(Y=1\\)’. We do this by solving for the amount of K needed to produce 1 as a function of L and then plotting this against a range of L \\[ Y = \\sqrt(KL) = 1 \\rightarrow KL = 1 \\] \\[ \\rightarrow K = 1/L \\] Setting this at Y = 2 \\[ Y = \\sqrt(KL) = 2 \\rightarrow KL = 4 \\] \\[ \\rightarrow K = 4/L \\] Connect values of x and z that lead to the same value of y. 2.28 Simultaneous equations (Cover briefly in lecture) E.g., \\[ X + Y = 3 \\] \\[ X - Y = 1 \\] Holds only where \\(X=2, Y=1\\), the ‘unique solution’ Note: Be sure you know how to solve the above. Adv math: Note, in general, we need as many equations as unknowns (above 2 of each) to possibly be able to find a solution. However, some sets of equations have no* solution, and some may have Meaningless to ask ‘how does a change in X affect Y?’ in the above context. Equally meaningless: ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged?’ in a demand-supply Marshallian cross. 2.29 Empirical microeconomics/econometrics Empirical research Uses evidence from the real world, i.e., observation, to answer questions (rather than introspection and theory) Econometrics The ‘science’ of using data to answer economic questions Uses statistical tools and often economic theory Micro-data Data where the unit of observation is an individual, household, firm, etc. (Contrasts from macro-data, data on aggregates like GDP, inflation, etc.) Econometrics often has a different focus and different methodology than ‘regular statistics’. Econometrics has taken on a larger role in economics over the past 40 years, because of greater data availability and computing power. Most published papers in economics now involve some econometric analysis. 2.30 Empirical meta-example Suppose we are trying to estimate the market demand curve; suppose we hypothesize that this demand curve is a linear function. (I.e., suppose we assume that quantity demanded is a linear function of price). \\[Q_d = a-bp\\] Suppose we know that price is changing because of cost changes, shifts in supply curve, or the firm experimenting Otherwise the problem is poorly identified, as demand and supply will jointly determine price We observe price and quantity data for a period where ceteris paribus is reasonable We try to fit the ‘best’ line through these points (minimizing the distances between the line and the points, or minimizing the ‘error’ of this predicted quantity) We estimate the demand curve’s slope and intercept. We can use this to make inferences. This line will never fit exactly, because of unobserved differences, nonlinear demand, measurement error, randomness in behaviour. But this fitted line is only meaningful if we are observing shifts in the supply curve and not the demand curve! (Can you explain why?) 2.30.1 Ceteris paribus All [most] economic theories employ the assumption that ‘other things are held constant.’ In above data/figure, demand may differ between weeks/stores, weather may change, etc. ‘the points may lie on several different demand curves, and attempting to force them into a single curve would be a mistake.’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) We would like to carefully ‘control’ for other observable factors May also use flexible functions permitting heterogeneity – differing slopes. We can never control for everything or know ‘true’ functional form. Sadly, all empirical work involves imperfect compromises. But happily there are ways to test and validate the estimates, e.g., see how well they predict future outcomes. 2.31 Exogenous and endogenous variables Note: This is a fairly difficult concept Suppose a model of supply and demand with ‘exogenous shifters’: \\(W\\) is an external or exogenous variable that increases the quantity demanded at any price E.g., the amount of a windfall tax rebate, boosting net income \\(Z\\) is an exogenous variable that makes production more costly, increasing the price firms require to supply a particular quantity E.g., the level of the minimum wage, or e.g., energy prices We can then write the supply and demand model as: \\[Q=-P+W\\] \\[P=Q+Z\\] P and Q are the endogenous variables Don’t ask ‘how does P change in Q?’ W and Z are the exogenous variables If we know W and Z we can solve for the equilibrium Q and P Can observe how this equilibrium responds to shifts in Q and P 2.32 Application 1A.3: … Changing world oil prices This will be probably skipped in lecture, but please read it. This will be referred to in problem sets/tutorials. This is a great example from perhaps the most important unified global market, with tremendous fluctuations that have huge impacts. It shows the power of empirical microeconomics. (Note edition 12 updates.) Henceforth we will refer to: the market demand curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as \\(Q_D(P,...)\\) and the market supply curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as \\(Q_S(P,...)\\). The quantity (units of a good) that firms in the market are willing to supply is a function of the price and other ‘background’ things. The total quantity that consumers in the market or willing to demand is a different function of the price of other things. We typically these ‘supply curve’, and ‘demand curve’, respectively, but I want to to think of these as functions that can shift. I don’t want you to write ‘demand went down’; that is ambiguous. The price where these quantities are equal is the ‘prevailing price in the market’. We build this up throughout the next sections in more detail. Getting back to the example… Empirical work has estimated the equations below, the estimated supply and demand curves expressed in dollars and millions of barrels, from an earlier period: \\[ Q_D = 85 - 0.4P \\: (D) \\] \\[ Q_S = 55 + 0.6P \\: (S) \\] Setting \\(Q_S=Q_D\\) and solving this yields: \\(85 - 0.4P=55+0.6P \\rightarrow P = 30, Q = 73\\) This approximates the 2000-2002 price So what accounted for price rise in 2008 to about US$130, and then fall to US$50 by March 2009? China and India’s economy grew, implying a growth in the world economy by 3-4% per year Various calculations imply that this represents a shifting out in the Demand curve from \\(Q_D = 85 - 0.4P\\) to: \\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\\] Side note: I think the ‘new demand’ curve comes from an approximation: if the world economy grew at 4% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it’s previous size. … thus the growth is \\(1.047^7=1.316\\). They assume oil’s demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112. Note that the text has a typo: equation 3 on page 40, the new demand, should read \\(Q=112-0.4P\\). With the same supply curve and the new demand curve we have \\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\\] \\[Q_S = 55 + 0.6P\\] This \\(\\rightarrow\\) solves to \\(P=57, Q=87\\) Furthermore, overall price inflation, US$ devaluation \\(\\rightarrow\\) accounts for about a price of US$94 So why was did the price move to $130? Other changes included: Speculation, other disruptions. Supply may have also shifted (political turmoil, new sources of energy, etc.) Do you know the current price of oil per barrel in USD and GBP? 2.33 More advanced material on causal inference -The mixtape, Scott Cunningham pp 18-22, and more Autor, MIT ‘Microeconomic theory and public policy’, lecture 2 Much of this work has tried to specify more and more general conditions for this, requiring less and less stringent assumptions.↩ "]
