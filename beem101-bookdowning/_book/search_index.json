That approach is taken in our MRes module, not in this module. (Note that exams from year before 2016 are not indicative of what you will face in this module.) This is required because of the diverse education backgrounds of the students in our programme. However, I will be including some more rigorous material, as well as state-of-the-art research, and I will give you pointers on pursuing more advanced extensions to the material. 1.2 Readings and resources This module will use a variety of resources: I will guide you through this via the ‘handout’ (really a partial online text) file. This draws heavily from several texts and other resources, including: Introduction to Economic Analysis version 2.1 by McAfee, Lewis, and Dale – available for free LINKED HERE under a Creative Commons license. Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50… older editions are fine too) A free alternative, at a similar level: Microeconomics an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine From time to time I will refer you (and draw from) another open source work that has very clear explanations: Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus by Yoram Baumann, the self-proclaimed ‘World’s First Standup Economist’ More rigorous, advanced and applied work will draw from David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here)[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/] this will give you a flavor of the PhD level micro David Autor. 14.03 Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy. Fall 2016. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare, https://ocw.mit.edu. License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA. Academic articles and working papers as well as some of my own writings… these are mentioned below *A more detailed description of the texts is given in the next section, here 1.3 This ‘handout’ online resource Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics I wrote these notes to outline all of the material you are responsible for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short amount of time we have during lecture. I don’t mean you’re simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that these notes will aim to refer to everything that you are responsible for. These notes are meant to be a complement to the textbooks and readings (and to the lectures, tutorials/problem sets and other material on the ELE) and to tie all of this together. I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in these notes. However, each year the module adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to these notes as we go along. I will try to keep you informed of any changes via the VLE forums. Notes versus slides?: These notes should include all of the slide material plus explanatory notes and enrichment material. (However, I left out some of the jokes.) I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will also try to make the slides themselves available after the lectures, even though they are redundant– these notes have everything. Some ‘markers’ and abbreviations: ‘McDL’ refers to the McAfee, Dale and Lewis text ‘NS’ refers to the Nicholson and Snyder text (usually chapters/numbering from the 12th edition is referenced; if you’re using an earlier edition, make sure the content corresponds) ‘DA’ refers to David Autor’s MIT open courseware notes for Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy ‘QMC’ refers to ‘Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus’ Text in blue usually refers to questions you should try to answer on your own (and I sometimes provide suggested answers in the footnotes. Try to answer it yourself first.) Some text is given in gray to indicate that this is a side point or a discussion. (I’m moving most of this to footnotes.) ‘Comprehension Q:’ A question you should be able to answer if you are following along. ‘T numbers’ (take these loosely please) refer to the weeks of term in which I intended to cover specific material. For example ‘T1:03 - T1:04a’ means ‘term 2 week three (both lectures) and term 2 week 4, first lecture only’ 1.4 Outline and description of module Planned syllabus, coverage: The planned module outline is below; as noted, timings may need to be adjusted, and so material may cut for time constraints. Feel free to skip over the first time you read these notes; you may want to refer to this later. The relevant part of this outline will be repeated at the beginning of each ‘section.’ Module outline, background, Economic models (and maths tools), ‘empirical’ evidence (*) [1a] First lecture McAfee et al (‘McDL’), Chapter 1 (or) Nicholson &amp; Snyder (NS): Chapter 1 and 1a Discussion of ‘empirical identification’: The mixtape, Scott Cunningham pp 18-22 Math revision concepts in DA lecture 3; we may not use all of this QMC 1.3 (some good studd don’t worry too much about derivative rules) NS ch 1a (you need this and a bit more) T1:01a (Term 1, week 1, first hour; ‘empirical’) Supplementary reading: Friedman, Milton. “The methodology of positive economics.” (1953): 259.
