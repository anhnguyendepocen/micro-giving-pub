That approach is taken in our MRes module, not in this module. (Note that exams from year before 2016 are not indicative of what you will face in this module.) This is required because of the diverse education backgrounds of the students in our programme. However, I will be including some more rigorous material, as well as state-of-the-art research, and I will give you pointers on pursuing more advanced extensions to the material. 1.2 Readings and resources This module will use a variety of resources: I will guide you through this via the ‘handout’ (really a partial online text) file. This draws heavily from several texts and other resources, including: Introduction to Economic Analysis version 2.1 by McAfee, Lewis, and Dale – available for free LINKED HERE under a Creative Commons license. Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50… older editions are fine too, but beware of some changes) A free alternative, at a similar level: Microeconomics an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine Microeconomics by Hugh Gravelle and Ray Rees (version 3, widely available online for free) A somewhat more advanced-intermediate-level text which I think you will find very useful; this is not yet officially Open-Source, but you can find it online for free (and the authors are OK with this, I have emailed them). Just do a web search for ‘Gravelle and Rees Microeconomics’ and you will find the pdf From time to time I will refer you (and draw from) another open source work that has very clear explanations: Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus by Yoram Baumann, the self-proclaimed ‘World’s First Standup Economist’ More rigorous, advanced and applied work will draw from David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here)[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/] this will give you a flavor of the PhD level micro David Autor. 14.03 Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy. Fall 2016. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare, https://ocw.mit.edu. License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA. Academic articles and working papers as well as some of my own writings… these are mentioned below *A more detailed description of the texts is given in the next section, here 1.3 This ‘handout’/ web-book/ online resource Welcome to the exciting world of Microeconomics I wrote these notes to outline all of the material you are responsible for, and to give you more resources and insight than I can convey in the short amount of time we have during lecture. I don’t mean you’re simply responsible for material in these printed notes: I mean that these notes will aim to refer to everything that you are responsible for. These notes are meant to be a complement to the textbooks and readings (and to the lectures, tutorials/problem sets and other material on the ELE) and to tie all of this together. I will try my best to stick to the structure outlined in these notes. However, each year the module adjust slightly as we go and I will need to make updates to these notes as we go along. I will try to keep you informed of any changes via the VLE forums. Notes versus slides?: These notes should include all of the slide material plus explanatory notes and enrichment material. (However, I left out some of the jokes.) I use some abbreviations before certain notes to help you understand how to digest this. I will also make the slides themselves available after just before the lectures, even though they are redundant– these notes have everything. Some ‘markers’ and abbreviations: ‘McDL’ refers to the McAfee, Dale and Lewis text ‘NS’ refers to the Nicholson and Snyder text (usually chapters/numbering from the 12th edition is referenced; if you’re using an earlier edition, make sure the content corresponds) GR refers to Gravelle and Rees’ Microeconomics text (free online, more or less) ‘DA’ refers to David Autor’s MIT open courseware notes for Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy ‘QMC’ refers to ‘Quantum Microeconomics with Calculus’ (Baumann) Text in blue usually refers to questions you should try to answer on your own (and I sometimes provide suggested answers in the footnotes. Try to answer it yourself first.) Some text is given in gray to indicate that this is a side point or a discussion. (I’m moving most of this to footnotes.) ‘Comprehension Q:’ A question you should be able to answer if you are following along. ‘T numbers’ (take these loosely please) refer to the weeks of term in which I intended to cover specific material. For example ‘T1:03 - T1:04a’ means ‘term 2 week three (both lectures) and term 2 week 4, first lecture only’ 1.3.1 Tech details of this book (‘do I call this ’collophon’?) I created this in Rmd (the ‘R languages’ ‘markdown’), including some latex and html code too. This is all put together by Knitr and Bookdown using the ‘Pandoc’ conversion tool into an Html file which I’m hosting via Github pages for now. I’ll occasionally use/show some R code; you should consider getting proficient in R and developing other ‘data-sciencey’ tech skills (things like R, Python, Stata, git, vim, shell scripts…) Let me know if you want to look ‘under the hood’. 1.4 Outline and description of module Planned syllabus, coverage: The planned module outline is below; as noted, timings may need to be adjusted, and so material may cut for time constraints.

The material in these problem sets either comes from exams or builds exam skills. These will be posted BELOW. Representative answers for each problem set will be given a few days after each problem set is released, or shortly before the relevant support class. Classes (AKA ‘tutorials’ AKA ‘seminars’) every fortnight (5 total) Support classes will largely focus on covering (exploring, solving, discussing) the problem sets. However, there will obviously not be time to cover every question in the tutorial. Note there are only 5 tutorials but 8 problem sets; thus, tutorials may cover problems from multiple recent problem sets. These classes are about applying material you have learned, not lecturing on it or learning it for the first time. Come ready to ask questions and participate: I aim to make these highly interactive and participatory. To really be helpful, we need to know what areas you might be struggling with and where your logic might be breaking down; thus we will either do cold calling or highly encourage all the students in these tutorials to ask and answer questions. Think of these as (especially) ‘safe spaces’; you will be judged or marked based on your performance in the support classes, and there are no dumb questions. If you have a question many of your peers probably have the same question, so asking it provides a public good. Marks Midterm, 90 minutes 35 marks Final examination, 2 hours: 65 marks Classes every fortnight Plus research ‘coffees’ (discussion sessions) in alternate weeks, if you are interested Texts and resources {-#texts} In previous years I recommended Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50… older editions are fine too). However, you may find this to be too basic a level, as it’s meant for undergraduates. Have a look. I am now using and recommending several other free online resources instead (or in addition). Note that this is a ‘standard core’: any intermediate or advanced textbook in microeconomics will cover most of the same material. A focal resource: Introduction to Economic Analysis - MacAffee, Lewis, Dale A ‘no-fluff’ text from an esteemed source. Covers much of this module, but the level varies somewhat throughout. Includes calculus and lots of parametric examples. Lots of great content. Lots of solved problems. I will also heavily draw on: Quantum Microeconomics; consider the version either with or without calculus An unconventional but very careful and interesting approach; my impression is that it is well organised and explained. You may like it! David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; all the files for this course can be downloaded here this will give you a flavor of nearly-PhD-level micro Microeconomics Markets, Methods &amp; Models an Open Text by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine A full-fledged text covering many of the topics of this module, without calculus Intermediate microeconomics - M Walbert Illinois tutorials - click ‘tutorials’ A series of tutorials for an intermediate microeconomics module. Covers many of the topics of this module. No calculus but a lot of algebra. Lots of supplementary materials too. Note: The module moves through select parts of textbooks; coverage and order given in handout. Lectures \\(\\neq\\) everything!: Some of the text is only mentioned in lecture/handout, but you still must read &amp; learn it. On the other hand some sections of each text are skipped. Some material is covered in these handouts, or recommended readings, that is not in the text; this is clearly emphasized. All of this is laid out in this handout. 2.1 Feedback on your highly-esteemed but extremely humble lecturer We will have two ‘official’ feedback points. There will be an ‘early feedback’ survey, perhaps around week 4 or 5. This gives you a chance to give me constructive suggestions that I can adapt to during the rest of the module. For the Accelerate end-of-module feedback, you will be asked to rate me. All of these questions are seen as an evaluation of my performance specifically by the “associate dean”. You will be asked to express an opinion, from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’, on one or more questions about the quality of this module. In particular: Overall I am satisfied with the quality of the module. If at any time you think you don’t agree with any of these, please let me know how I can make it better I am not particularly a fan of the “customer service” model of education. It leads lecturers to water-down the content and hinders us from presenting challenging and engaging material. and limit your educational experience. In fact, there is in fairly compelling research that suggests that these measures are not reliable and are “poorly correlated with student learning”. Responding to feedback I listen carefully to your responses and continually adjust the material and the approach. To give you the best education, I try to follow a process of Kaizen, or continual improvement. I also make changes from year-to-year, in response to your feedback. Additional enrichment texts (have a look at in case you are thinking of going for a PhD in economics or in doing/applying advanced microeconomic theory in your dissertation) As mentioned, more rigorous and mathematical theory as well as good discussions of empirical and applied research is found in David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware \"Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy; referenced and incorporated throughout the module Nechyba ‘Intermediate Microeconomics’ seems to be a step up from this in maths and formalism PhD level: Jehle and Reny’s “Advanced Microeconomic Theory”, or Hal Varian’s text “Microeconomic Analysis”; Mas-Colell et al for the hardcore only 2.2 The story of this module Note: You may have seen many of these concepts before. But do you really understand them well enough to explain them to a non-economist and to apply them to a new real-world situation? And do you understand the limits and critiques of these, and how economists try to measure and test them? Asessment hint: I try to ask you questions that you would not know the answer to had you not taken this module. What would be the purpose of you simply learning ‘common sense’ or ‘conventional wisdom’ … that you already knew? If you are answering an open response/essay question by simply stating something that the average Joe sitting on a pub bench would have said, you may want to rethink the way you are answering this question. I am not designing the exams to trip you up… just to check that you have learned something. 1. Economic basics (weeks 1-2) In weeks one and two we will go over some of the simple tools in the economists’ kit. I will try to explain to you what we mean by ‘economic models’ and give you some examples of these which may be familiar to you. We will also start thinking about, and formalising individual decisions—over nearly all spheres of life— in a way you may not have seen before, which may even strike you as weirdly hyper-rational. Essentially, this (sometimes confusingly called ‘normative decision theory’) is the way economists typically conceive of and model people’s choices. Even though it seems to require precise optimization, perhaps to a strange extent, there are various reasonable justifications for this, and you might also see it as a benchmark… ‘Let’s understand what optimization would look like, as a starting point’. This framework is actually fairly general; it can allow all sorts of preferences (e.g., embodying ‘risk aversion’ and ‘altruism’) and wide-ranging choices. However it does imply certain ‘restrictions’: it rules out some sort of behavior that is perhaps obviously illogical. We will discuss how ‘preferences’ may define the ‘utility functions’. The ‘uility function’ is the thing that make choices in order to maximize. In the classical framework, people make choices in order to maximise the value of their utility function. Utility functions can also be expressed in terms of ‘indifference curves’ (but keep the distinction in mind; the indifference curves are not themselves the utility functions). Under this framework individuals make the ‘optimal choices’ … by making the choices that yield the maximum value of the utility functions given their constraints … in particular they have a ‘budget constraint’ that says they cannot spend more than they earn. You will learn how to derive these budget constraints and plot these on a graph, along with the indifference curves, and to interpret these diagrams. I will also introduce ‘data’ and some key concepts from ‘Empirical analysis’ and ‘Econometrics’ here 2. Building the model, putting it together, examining it (weeks 3-5 approx) ‘What determines the price and quantities exchanged in an unregulated (or ’free’) market?’ ‘Do markets yield good outcomes?’ These questions have been at the backbone of Economics for millennia, at least since Aristotle. Classical economists such as Adam Smith built-up ideas of how seemingly random and disorganized markets can yield predictable and efficient outcomes, at least under appropriate conditions. Neoclassical and modern economists (such as Alfred Marshall, David Ricardo, Leon Walras, and Paul Samuelson) have formalized these, building models involving of systems of demand and supply and general equilibrium, and have made the case for the efficiency and desirability of the free market outcomes, at least under specified conditions.1 In the second (and largest) chunk of the course, we will learn some of the essential building blocks of this model, and how they are justified and put together to yield predictions for market outcomes and ‘welfare’. In the process, we will get useful ideas and intuitions about the working of markets. We will learn how individual optimization implies a relationship between the price of a good (and the consumer’s income) and the amount a consumer chooses to purchase of that good; her individual demand curve. Adding up these individual demand curves yields the market demand curve, which describes the way the total amount of a good consumers wish to purchase depends on the market price of that good. Someone has to make this stuff, you know! We consider ‘production functions’ that map how inputs can be turned into outputs. If firms are seeking to maximize profits, then whatever output they want to produce … they will try to produce it using the combination of inputs (Capital, labor, etc.) that can do this at the lowest cost. If we know production functions and input costs, we can describe a firm’s cost of producing every amount of a particular good. Economists typically assume that firms make choices to maximize profits. (Mathematically, this ‘optimisation’, i.e., maximisation, has some things in common with the consumer optimisation of utility, so it may look familiar). Knowing their cost of production and the demand curve they will face, firms will thus choose to produce the amount that yields them the highest profit; we will explain the conditions for this. With ‘free entry/exit of firms’ we have the (ideal) situation of perfect competition. Each firm’s supply curve is added up to generate the market supply curve; we consider this in both the ‘short and long run’. We define the concepts of ‘consumer surplus’ and ‘producer surplus’; adding these yields the total value in an economy or the total ‘social welfare’. We will briefly and roughly consider the idea of an equilibrium in all markets; prices such that quantity demanded equals quantity supplied for all outputs and inputs. We will get some sense of the idea of what general ‘economic efficiency’ means. I will state and give you some intuition behind the ‘first and second welfare theorems’; the conditions under which free markets yield ‘good outcomes’, defined in a particular sense. 3. How the market can go wrong (and how to maybe fix it) (weeks 6-7 approx) Notice I kept saying “under certain conditions” free markets yield good outcomes. These conditions may not hold, for various reasons. In the third chunk, we discuss two of these reasons, which lead to ‘market failures’. It is important to understand these. These (sometimes) offer a justification for government intervention, and help us understand how government can best respond. These also offer insights for business models; which ‘goods’ may be hard to provide without government subsidies, and how can we use technological innovation to capture value and reduce the extent of market failures? (Businesses may also be able to take advantage of market failures in ways that are harmful to public welfare, But I would hate to think I’m training you to do this.) Not all goods can easily be restricted to a single consumer. ‘Non-rival’ and ‘non-excludable’ goods (e.g., a fireworks display) are called public goods: these will tend to be undersupplied by the free market, as we will come to understand. We will also discuss the evidence for the private provision of these, and consider government’s ability to provide them. This is the polar opposite market structure to perfect competition; a monopoly is a single firm that exclusively dominated a particular industry. It will tend to produce less and charge more than would be socially optimal, yielding a ‘deadweight loss’ (aka ‘DWL’). ‘Price discrimination’ is (more or less) when a firm charges different prices to different consumers; this can reduce (or increase) the ‘deadweight loss’ of monopoly, as we will learn. 4. Extensions to the model and applications (weeks 8-11) In the final chunk we extend the model to accommodate some important aspects of the real world. We investigate the implication of these for market outcomes. We make many decisions without knowing exactly what the consequence of each choice will be. Economists typically model this using the “expected utility” framework. A warning: students often get this concept wrong, so be careful. Expected utility is not the same as ‘expected monetary value’; and this allows EU to embody risk aversion. For many decisions we make the consequences depend on what others do; we have ‘strategic interaction’. Economists usually consider this using the framework and tools of game theory. Asymmetric information–where one side knows something the other doesn’t– complicates our analysis. Another approach to considering strategic interactions involves enforcable contracts (but some elements that cannot be put into these contracts); this falls under ‘the theory of the Principal and Agent’ or ‘Mechanism Design.’ This has of particular interest to many students in previous years, so I add some coverage of this. People may not actually make decisions in the hyper-rational way we have been assuming. Here we carefully consider the adaptation of some insights from Psychology to Economics, yielding ‘behavioral economics’. The big (small) question What’s gonna be on the exam?? As noted, you are responsible for all material outlined in this handout … the syllabus + assigned readings + materials covered in lecture and tutorials. E.g., the exams may cover material only briefly mentioned in lecture, and will expect knowledge from prerequisites I try to reward broad understanding, rather than merely the ability to memorize a few formulae and definitions. So try to really know this stuff and be able to discuss it and apply it, both to algebraic/numerical examples and to real-world issues. I give you copious examples of what will be on the examinations, including practice problems at the end of each lecture, problem sets, lots of mock and sample question on the VLE, and previous examinations and midterms. Practice: Solving quantitative problems, clearly explaining the steps you take and what it all means Writing succinct, clear, logical answers Understand the logic of questions I have asked in past years, including multiple-choice questions. Be sure you understand what I am asking! Resources So, why are you here? Perhaps not to hear what the lecturer has to say, but for the lecturer to respond to what you say We live in a world post-printing press and with lots of digital media. To be honest, there are some things about lecturing that are obsolete in my opinion. Anyone can hear great lectures online or read extremely informative textbooks. However, as a student at this Russell group University… You can interact with me, ask me questions, come up with ideas, work with other students. Impress me and get a good letter of reference. I advise everyone to come to my office hours at least once. I highly advise you to use the forum to ask and answer questions and make suggestions and comments. Students typically find this forum very useful.

The more conversations we have the more you will get out of this module, and the better you will be able to communicate your ideas on the exams. Stay tuned for the ‘announcements’ Also, there is a bunch of other material on the VLE. Remember to do practice questions and formative assessments! In-lecture interaction Even though our lecture time is scarce, It seems to me that to get value out of this antiquated format known as a lecture, we should have at least some interaction. Otherwise, you may as well be watching a video. Some things we may work with include: Responseware, questions, polls and ‘chat’ In-lecture experiments and games Remember to install Responseware on your smart phones, or get a free turningpoint clicker! Download it on app stores, or use it on a laptop the session id is ‘david’ (check) browser mode: To get the most out of the lectures, I advise you to Ask me questions, especially at beginning and end, raise both hands if you are lost Draw-along and solve-along with the slides and board work. The act of trying to construct models, solve algebra, and draw and interpret diagrams yourself really helps you understand them better and use them How to do well Put in the work Read the handout and the relevant parts of the text (as outlined in this handout) in advance of the lecture, come with questions Handouts and lectures mainly follow the text Do the problem set questions, suggested questions and class questions, understand the answers Do the many practice problems and mock exam questions Care about the content Care about actually understanding this stuff.

Skills to hone and build. Your success in this module will depend in large part on building and applying maths skills and tools, as well as strong reading/writing/logic and communication abilities. You should build the ability to comprehend and respond carefully and logically to nuanced questions (essay/short answer, solved problem, and multiple choice). These problem will incorporate quantitative reasoning, logic, and the ability to understand and clearly express ideas, to correctly characterise and describe theories and evidence, and to apply learned principles to new situations. Fortune Cookie Wisdom Here are some broad lessons that I hope you take away from this module, And that will help you throughout… I will come back to these. It may seem like we have the answers, but this is only where we have asked the questions very carefully But sometimes ignorance is bliss. Examples: Sunk-cost fallacy, gains to trade/comparative advantage, opportunity cost, free-riding/prisoners’ dilemma, double-marginalization,‘raise price to raise profit’, etc. I’ve had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife. Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out. We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a ‘single representative consumer’. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights. However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or testing these models, be careful; people may differ and they may change and they may have multiple motives. Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets \\(\\rightarrow\\) opportunities. I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse. I’m not telling you what you need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics. As I also mentioned, these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks. Here are some possible examples. Imperfection: Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘All you can eat’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for ‘all-you-can-eat’ And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later. Free-riding on public goods \\(\\rightarrow\\) Disneyworld, resorts We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride. They then charge an admission fee to ‘be inside of Disney World’ and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods. Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Uber, AirBnb Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves). Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Tinder Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high. A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit. If you’re interested, see my research on this here, presentation slides here, my research page is here. Asymmetric information, adverse selection \\(\\rightarrow\\) NHS, ‘Obamacare’ This one is a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA. Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later). There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance (or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well. Note: Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you ‘outsource’ and when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do? 2.3 Background What is Economics? Note: DR: It has changed. There are different views. Ask two economists, and you’ll probably get at least three answers. “Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.” “Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” Alfred Marshall Note: The first quote suggests an approach (how we do our research), the second suggests a domain (what we focus on). Note: “Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.” Ludwig von Mises What is Microeconomics? The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets. Largely, using theoretical and mathematical ‘models’ that depend on strong assumptions. Comprehension Q: Consider some examples of ‘relevant choices’ for economic study. Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications. A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and ‘general’; some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed. But even these more general models are simplifications. 2.4 Why learn these models? Consider the parable of the tortoise and the hare (Aesop)… One might question the realism of this story: Can hares really speak? Is this a rabbit or a hare? What other animals were racing? Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above questions? The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models. Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop’s fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of ‘Ceteris paribus’ (all other things being equal) can help us here. What do models give us? There are different views of this Via logic and mathematics: Assumptions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Results and sometimes these also yield testable predictions (if the assumptions hold) Note:2 So why learn these models? A starting point (Sometimes) make concrete predictions you can test Building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking Discussion is framed around them and they are seen as a ‘baseline’ Understand the arguments and models to be able to effectively critique or extend them Some critics of what they call ‘neoliberal economics’ can be misinformed about what it is. Their criticism can sound to us mainstream economists like someone who says ‘cars are dangerous and should be banned because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping’ 2.5 Economic Models Economic model: Simple theoretical description that captures the essentials of how the economy works. Differing views on the use of economic models3 Engage in our ‘wiki’ discussion of these articles HERE Instrumentalist: The Methodology of Positive Economics (Friedman (1953)): the ultimate goal of theory is to “yield valid and meaningful … predictions about phenomena not yet observed”\" “Simplicity” – ‘the less initial knowledge needed to make a prediction’. “Fruitful” – more precise predictions, for a wider range of situations ‘Fictionalist’ (Sugden (2017)): describes a fictional world that is credible or truthlike in something like the way that the events of a realistic novel are; the model connects with the real world by relations of similarity Are these models predictive? If not, are they useful? There are arguments for modeling optimising behavior if it is not predictive. There is some evidence for near-optimisation in some settings, and that choices move in this direction. There is also evidence of ‘predictable irrationality’ (or ’bounded rationality); this motivates behavioural economics. There is some evidence for the following: Psychological costs/benefits relating to *outcomes other than their own final consumption. People may care about others’ consumption (altruism etc.), about the way they make the decision … and about how close they come to certain goals (see ‘reference points’ and ‘loss aversion’). People have self-control problems. They also may realize their short-term choices are not in their lt interest, and try to constrain themselves. It is mentally costly to carefully calculate the costs and benefits \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘rational inattention’ As a result, people may follow simple rules or ‘heuristics’ to make their decisions easier; e.g., ‘work every day until I’ve earned target income’. The PPF: a ‘model’ and a way of seeing things At this point we consider a simple and specific model to fix ideas, to make things less abstract. The NS text brings up the production possibility frontier; this is a common example to start with, although by itself it could be argued that ‘the insights gained are basically by assumption’ … there is not really an additional reasoning step. Perhaps a better depiction of this example is in the Curtis and Irvine open access text, sections 1.3-1.5, where they consider two individuals with distinct production possibilities, and derive the ‘aggregate’ ppf, and show the gains to trade. Above, we see a depiction of the “production possibility frontier” (PPF), explained in the figure’s caption. You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced. The NS text claims… PPF illustrates key principles Principle 1: Scarce Resources Principle 2: Scarcity involves opportunity cost. Notes: The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it. The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone ‘next best’ opportunity from a choice. I may just call this ‘cost’ Comprehension question (advanced): Think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the ‘cost’ and the economists’ definition of an ‘opportunity cost’ On the PPF the opportunity cost of more clothing is less food. Principle 3: Opportunity costs are (often) increasing. What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases. The “law” of diminishing marginal returns.4 However I’m not sure if I would call this a ‘model’, but it certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions. This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now. To make this more clearly a ‘model with assumptions’, let’s assume an economy with Two possible goods: food and clothing A single input into the production process for either good labour (L) The economy has a fixed supply of labour \\(\\bar{L}\\). The production function for food is \\(F_f(L)\\) and the production function for clothing is \\(F_c(L)\\), with both ‘strictly and continuously increasing in their argument’. All firms have these same production functions (this implies there are no spillovers/externalities between firms, and no complementarities between producing each good) Both production functions exhibit diminishing returns to scale (we leave off the maths for how to precisely define this for now) These assumptions could be considered a ‘model’ of an economy. Note that not everything has been specified, e.g., we might ask: How many firms are there? How do the firms compete in output and input markets? What exactly are these production functions? There are also clearly unrealistic elements, e.g., Only two goods Only one input No complementarities in production Still, the assumptions given will yield a PPF with the shape above: the ‘feasible production set’ of the economy will have a particular shape. It’s ‘maximal elements’ constitute the ‘frontier’ of this set, which will be: downward-sloping, because each unit of the input (\\(L\\)) used to produce clothing cannot be used to produce food. concave (increasing opportunity costs), because of the diminishing returns to scale for each good … as more labour is diverted to clothing away from food, it becomes less and less relatively productive This seems to convey an insight that 1. teaches us a way of thinking and 2. seems likely to carry over into more ‘realistic’ models. At the very least, it suggests that, under any economic system, there may be tradeoffs between how much of each good or service can be consumed. E.g., policymakers may need to consider ‘should we have more health care or more non-health consumption’, rather than simply saying ‘we should provide the best health care that money can buy to everyone.’5 The ‘increasing opportunity costs’ insight seems more fragile, more dependent on a fairly strong assumption. How do we know that there are diminishing returns to scale for each good? There are plausible reasons why it may be the opposite… returns to specialisation as an economy, etc. Furthermore, the model at this level of simplicity cannot speak to a number of questions. E.g., without a sense of the market structure (how many firms and how do they compete), we do not know whether we will attain the PPF– the economy may end up producing at the inferior point ‘C’, for example. A ‘simpler’ model is not necessarily better, nor necessarily worse. Note: For comprehension: Be sure you can draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means. 2.6 NS Application 1.1: Economics in the Natural world Studies of honeybees have found that they generally do not gather all of the nectar in a particular flower before moving on. Why not? What key features do modern human economies have that ‘animal economies’ don’t have? Largely: trade, prices, specialisation, free choice vs instinct. The economics of trade may also apply to the natural world in certain ways. Above, we see the working of ant-aphid symbiosis, a form of mutualism. Relevant to the ‘conditions necessary for trade to occur’? The ants ‘farm’ the aphids, who secrete nice substances. In return the ants protect the aphids and only sometimes eat them. 2.7 Returns to education; Is university worth the time and money? Microeconomics is at the core of questions such as this. (This is discussed in the NS text) This is a contentious issue, especially in the USA, where private university tuitions run at over £40,000 per year (for a four-year course!) There is constant popular discussion of this. See, e.g., … Please stop asking whether college is worth it Is your university degree barely worth the paper it’s written on? Discuss The case against education, Bryan Caplan; LSE review Note: the above are popular accounts, not academic Economic peer-reviewed publications. For some fairly recent academic references, see (e.g.) (Carneiro et al, 2011)6, papers cited wihin this, and papers citing it. Link to paper The answer to this question depends on Microeconomic concepts such as Returns to labour inputs in (competitive?) markets; human capital The role of skilled labor in the production function Asymmetric information over employee ‘type’ and ‘signaling’ Intertemporal substitution of consumption and ‘discount rates’ Even framing the question requires microeconomics. Consider: Social vs private returns. Is there a case for ‘market failure’ in the provision of education? 2.8 Basic Supply-Demand Model We will not be covering the historical background to the Marshallian cross (the demand and supply you may be familiar with). You have seen this before. However, I want you to develop a careful and precise understanding of this and of what lies behind it, and to be able to explain this correctly and clearly. …Describes how a good’s price and the quantity exchanged are determined Determined by the preferences, behaviour, and costs of potential buyers and sellers 2.9 Marshall’s Model of Supply and Demand Economists and philosophers have long sought to explain ‘what determines the prices, and why do they change the way they do?’ In the 19th century UK prices were falling while quantities were increasing; this was a puzzle. Alfred Marshall argued that a good’s price must equal both the cost to produce and the value (to consumers) of the last unit produced and consumed. He introduced the ‘demand curve’; with a downward slope. This slope was justified by ‘satiation’: for an individual, additional units of a good are usually valued less and less. For example, you might be willing to pay thousands of pounds to be able to access 100 gallons of water rather than no water at all, but if you already have access to a thousand gallons of water, you will not be willing to pay very much for an additional 100 gallons. Furthermore, firms must cater to less and less keen consumers as they want to sell more and more units. We come back to this later in the module. ‘Willingness to pay’ (wtp) becomes less and less for the next unit purchased, so will buy more only at a lower price. Equivalently, at a lower price more people find the value exceeds the price, and for additional units. Note that we will also return to these questions in more depth in later chapters as we build up the demand and supply curves. With ‘single crossing’ (a fancy condition you can ignore at least for now) there is a unique price where \\(Q^s(p)=Q^d(p)\\), and a unique quantity where the last unit’s value to the consumer equals its cost to produce. Scissors analogy The equilibrium model is analogised to a pair of scissors; neither scis cuts alone So don’t ask ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged’? Understand why ‘Just like neither scis cuts alone, neither the supply nor the demand curve determines the equilibrium price and quantity in isolation’? Consider: What does it mean to be at equilibrium, and how do we get there? Draw: the famous Marshallian cross Be sure you can explain The inefficiency of any price other than where \\(Q^D(p)=Q^S(p)\\)? If the price was set at a different value, what forces might push it to the equilibrium?7 Harder question: Who gains or suffers with a government-imposed price floor/ceiling?. This is the question of ‘tax incidence’. To respect yourself in the morning, you must know Which factors cause the supply and demand curves to shift? What causes ‘movements along’ the supply or demand curve? Note: Caveat, to avoid later confusion: These models assume ‘price-taking’; neither buyers nor sellers consider the impact of their choices on prices 2.10 How Economists ‘Verify’ (or Assess) Theoretical Models Two methods: Testing Assumptions ‘Verifying’ economic models by examining validity of assumptions upon which models are based. Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.? DR: ‘Verifying’ is a bit too black and white’; all models have limitations. Note: NS is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions. However, there are many cases in which the predictions of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms. On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as ‘constant relative risk aversion’ or ‘geometric discounting’ can be very credibly tested. We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure ‘how close’ behavior is to the assumption. Testing Predictions Note: Verifying economic models by asking whether models can accurately predict real-world events. If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid. DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general. 2.11 Some maths I expect you to know All of these maths tools mentioned below should be straightforward for you. If not, you need to revise them very carefully! Most of the tools used in this module are being covered in your ‘Optimization’ (Beem103) and Econometric modules (and those will cover much more as well.) I’m in contact with these instructors. Reading the ‘Optimization’ module will be very helpful in understanding the notation in this handout and the accompanying readings. We will not cover these tools in lecture. I’ve charted some of the key maths concepts from BEEM103 (2018-19, not this year’s) below: L1 Unions and intersections Open and closed sets (for more advanced prep) Sets: the feasible consumption set and the budget set (latter contained within the former) Geometric series (discounting future payoffs) Sign diagrams (esp. if we get to mechanism design/principal-agent aspect of asymmetric information) And obviously the rules of basic algebra etc L2 Simultaneous equations e.g., supply and demand; considering exogenous and endogenous variables nonlinear equations (broadly) Sets of linear equations and matrix methods (for those going further into multi-good demand systems, etc) Functions of one variable, domain, range, graphing natural logarithm power functions (for exploring more advanced concepts like CES utility) Elasticity! Simple stuff (Univariate) Function A ‘map’ from one or more variables (\\(x\\)) (or ‘variables’) to an outcome (\\(y=f(x)\\)) for each value of \\(x\\) the function tells you a single value of \\(f(x)\\); typically we assign \\(y=f(x)\\) Note: ‘Variables’ are more formally called the ‘arguments’ of a function Linear function A function of the form \\(y=a+bX\\); e.g., \\(y = f(x) = -10 + 3x\\) Plotted as a straight line; intercept \\(a\\), constant slope \\(b\\) (Technically this is an ‘affine’ function; a linear function doesn’t have an intercept) Adv, Maths: For strictly linear functions (not including functions with constants) \\(f(a X_1 + b X_2) = a f(X_1) + b f(X_2)\\) for any values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) In particular ‘the function of the average is the average of the functions’ (this also holds for affine functions). This does not hold in general for nonlinear functions. Slope of \\(y = f(x)\\) The change in y for a given change in x. ‘Rise over run’. Arc slope: slope over a range Point slope: slope of the tangent to a curve at a point Nonlinear (univariate) function : A function \\(f(x)\\) of a form other than \\(f(x) = y=a+bX\\); E.g., a quadratic function \\(y = f(x) = a + bx + cx^2\\) E,g, \\(y = f(x) = 10 - 2x + 3x^2\\) Or a logarithmic \\(y=ln(x)\\) or exponential function \\(y = exp(x)\\) Note: I will try to limit things to linear and quadratic functions, and possibly exponential and log functions. I will remind you of the rules for dealing with these whenever it is necessary. For linear functions the slope is the same at any point. For nonlinear functions it may differ at each point. Think of the slope of a mountain versus the slope of a wheelchair ramp. The point here is that increasing X by 1 has the same effect on Y wherever you start, for a linear function but a different effect depending on where you start for a nonlinear function Instantaneous rate of change (instantaneous slope) The slope of the line tangent to the curve at a single point Adv, Math: This is the limit of the ‘rise over run’ as the run goes to zero Convex function: Slope everywhere increasing, unique minimum where slope \\(=0\\) Concave function: Slope everywhere decreasing, unique maximum where slope \\(=0\\) Note: we are referring to the signed value of the slope here, not the absolute value. E.g., for the convex case depicted, it goes from a negative slope to a zero slope to a positive slope For these functions the slope is different at each point. Note: We will mainly deal with functions like these, with a single minimum or maximum that occurs at the unique point with slope zero. Quadratic function are convex if the \\(x^2\\) term has a positive sign and concave if it has a negative sign. That’s because at extreme values of x the term with the largest exponent will dominate all other terms. Example of a convex function: Tiger’s golf earnings per game as function of hours of golf retraining… he had to get worse before he could get better, they say. Or cost per smoothie as function of employees behind smoothie counter. One example of a concave function: how funny I am as function of beers I drink (on the other hand, how funny I think I am may be an everywhere increasing function. Derivative of a function A derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) is another function called \\(f&#39;(x)\\). \\(f&#39;(x)\\) tells us the slope of the function \\(f(x)\\) at any point \\(x\\). For example, the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2\\) For this linear function the slope is a constant, 2 E.g., the derivative of the quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2x - 4\\) derivative of the quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2x - 4\\) E.g., the slope at \\(x=1\\) is \\(f&#39;(x;x=1) = 1*1 - 4 = -2\\) The slope is zero where \\(f&#39;(x)=2x-4=0\\), or where \\(x=2\\) Is \\(x=2\\) at a min, a max, or neither? How do we know? In case you are interested, the R code to do this graph is below; this was some of the first ‘R’ code that I wrote. fun1p &lt;-function(x) 2*x -4 fun1 &lt;-function(x) x * x - 4*x+1 plot(fun1p,-.5,5,asp=1,xlim=c(-2,3),ylim=c(-3,4)) plot(fun1,-.5,5,asp=1,xlim=c(-2,3),ylim=c(-3,4),add=TRUE) abline(h=-1:3, v=-3:3, col=&quot;gray&quot;, lty=3) abline(h=0,v=0) Minimum, maximum, or neither? \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is a function that tells us the slope of \\(f(x)\\), or how \\(f(x)\\) changes in \\(x\\) at any point \\(x\\) In turn, the derivative of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is called \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\). This tells us how the slope changes as \\(x\\) increases Oversimplifying a bit: (Adv, Math: Essentially, for a class of functions where the domain is not bounded) if the slope is always increasing, i.e., if \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) everywhere, the function is convex (u-shaped), and has a single minimum where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) if the slope is always decreasing, i.e., if \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) everywhere, the function is concave (inverse-u-shaped), and has a single maximum where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) Functions of two or more variables (multivariate functions) Utility, profit, cost, production, returns, etc. May depend on multiple variables/inputs Need to illustrate tradeoffs between these \\[y=f(x,z)\\] \\(y\\) may increase and/or decrease in \\(x\\) and in \\(z\\) The rate of increase of y in \\(x\\) may depend on the values of \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) Similar for the rate of increase of y in z E.g., \\[y=\\sqrt(xz) = x^{1/2}z^{1/2}, x \\geq 0, z \\geq 0\\] Note the outcome will increase in each argument at a decreasing rate. What does it look like? 3d: project up to y from a “map” of x and z coordinates on the desk. This is hard to picture; ‘contour lines’ can help. Projecting a function up from X,Y space into the Z axis: Contour lines Contour lines Level sets - depict combinations of variables that hold the function constant at a particular value f(x,z) = A for some value \\(A\\) Level sets: E.g., indifference curves, isoquants and isocost curves. Note: It is difficult to depict more than 2 dimensions on a piece of paper. So we find the values for the 2 variables that give us a particular value for the third … which tells us how these trade off. Consider a production function: \\[Y = f(K,L) = \\sqrt(KL)\\] Setting this equal to 1 we can map out ‘all combinations of K and L that produce output \\(Y=1\\)’. We do this by solving for the amount of K needed to produce 1 as a function of L and then plotting this against a range of L \\[ Y = \\sqrt(KL) = 1 \\rightarrow KL = 1 \\] \\[ \\rightarrow K = 1/L \\] Setting this at Y = 2 \\[ Y = \\sqrt(KL) = 2 \\rightarrow KL = 4 \\] \\[ \\rightarrow K = 4/L \\] Let’s see the value of this function for some random combinations of K and L: K &lt;- rep(c(1,2,3,4), each = 4) L &lt;- rep(c(1,2,3,4), times=4) y &lt;- sqrt(K*L) contour_ex &lt;- hux(data.frame(K,L,y)) %&gt;% huxtable::add_colnames() %&gt;% theme_plain #knitr::include_graphics(&quot;contourcombos.png&quot;) For values of K 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4 and L 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 we have the values of \\(y=\\sqrt(K\\times L)\\): K L y 1 1 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 2 1.41 1 3 1.73 1 4 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 1 1.41 2 2 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 3 2.45 2 4 2.83 3 1 1.73 3 2 2.45 3 3 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 4 3.46 4 1 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 2 2.83 4 3 3.46 4 4 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that different combinations of K and L yield the same Y. E.g., in the above table we see three distinct pairs of K and L yielding Y=2. We can consider ’what combinations of values of this function yield a particular value? Connect values of K and L that lead to the same value of y yields ‘level sets’ or ‘contour lines’. Below, we plot all combinations of X and Z that satisfy \\(Y = \\sqrt(XZ)\\), for three values of Y: Y=1, Y=2, and Y=3. eq = function(x){1/x} eq2 = function(x){2/x} eq3 = function(x){3/x} ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 3)), aes(x=x)) + stat_function(fun=eq, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(colour = &quot;Y=1&quot;)) + stat_function(fun=eq2, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(colour = &quot;Y=2&quot;)) + stat_function(fun=eq3, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(colour = &quot;Y=3&quot;)) + xlab(&quot;X&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Z&quot;) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,3)) Figure 2.1: contour lines for Y = sqrt(XZ) 2.12 Simultaneous equations As shown above, the pair of equations \\[ y =-x+7 \\] \\[ y=2x+1 \\] holds only where \\(x=2\\) and \\(y=5\\).8 Note, in general, we need as many equations as unknowns (above 2 of each) to possibly be able to find a solution. However, some sets of equations have no* solution, and some may have It is meaningless to ask ‘how does a change in X affect Y?’ in the above context. Equally meaningless: ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged?’ in a demand-supply Marshallian cross. 2.13 Empirical microeconomics/econometrics Goals of the following material: Give a flavour of what empirical microeconomics is and you a sense of some of the key issues in empirical work (more of this later on, hopefully) Covers: Empirical research Uses evidence from the real world, i.e., observation, to answer questions (rather than introspection and theory) Econometrics The ‘science’ of using data to answer economic questions Uses statistical tools and often economic theory Micro-data Data where the unit of observation is an individual, household, firm, etc. (Contrasts from macro-data, data on aggregates like GDP, inflation, etc.) See, e.g., Euro-stat microdata Data on individual donations (at the donor level) from a large scale field experiment (Karlan and List) downloadable HERE Price and product data on gluten-free bread at the supermarket level ‘Macro-data’ This is contrasted from ‘Macro-data’ which is aggregated/averaged in some way (e.g., at the country-level or industry-level) E.g., Computer penetration and income by year and Chinese province Suicide, mental health, and GDP by country and year Econometrics often has a different focus and different methodology than ‘regular statistics’. Econometrics has taken on a larger role in economics over the past 40 years, because of greater data availability and computing power. Most published papers in economics now involve some econometric analysis. Throughout the module we will come back to the discussion of empirical work, testing, measuring, and estimating. 2.14 Empirical meta-example Suppose we are trying to estimate the market demand curve; suppose we hypothesize that this demand curve is a linear function. (I.e., suppose we assume that quantity demanded is a linear function of price). \\[Q_d = a-bp\\] Suppose we know that price is changing because of cost changes, shifts in supply curve, or the firm experimenting. Otherwise the problem is poorly identified, as demand and supply will jointly determine price We observe price and quantity data for a period where ceteris paribus is reasonable, such as the data below9 We try to fit the ‘best’ line through these points (minimizing the distances between the line and the points, or minimizing the ‘error’ of this predicted quantity) We estimate the demand curve’s slope and intercept. We can use this to make inferences. This line will never fit exactly, because of unobserved differences, nonlinear demand, measurement error, randomness in behaviour. But this fitted line is only meaningful if we are observing shifts in the supply curve and not the demand curve! (Can you explain why?) Ceteris paribus All [most] economic theories employ the assumption that ‘other things are held constant.’ In above data/figure, demand may differ between weeks/stores, weather may change, etc. ‘the points may lie on several different demand curves, and attempting to force them into a single curve would be a mistake.’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) We would like to carefully ‘control’ for other observable factors May also use flexible functions permitting heterogeneity – differing slopes. We can never control for everything or know ‘true’ functional form. Sadly, all empirical work involves imperfect compromises. But happily there are ways to test and validate the estimates, e.g., see how well they predict future outcomes. 2.15 Exogenous and endogenous variables Suppose a model of supply and demand with ‘exogenous shifters’: \\(W\\) is an external or exogenous variable that increases the quantity demanded at any price E.g., the amount of a windfall tax rebate, boosting net income \\(Z\\) is an exogenous variable that makes production more costly, increasing the price firms require to supply a particular quantity E.g., the level of the minimum wage, or e.g., energy prices We can then write the supply and demand model as: \\[Q=-P+W\\] \\[P=Q+Z\\] P and Q are the endogenous variables Don’t ask ‘how does P change in Q?’ W and Z are the exogenous variables If we know W and Z we can solve for the equilibrium Q and P Can observe how this equilibrium responds to shifts in Q and P 2.16 Changing world oil prices NS application 1A.3, also discussed in PRUM section 4.1. I’m showing this just to give you an easy example of how economic theory and empirical evidence are combined to bring answers to useful questions. This is a great example from perhaps the most important unified global market, with tremendous fluctuations that have huge impacts. It shows the power of empirical microeconomics. Henceforth we will refer to: the market demand curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as \\(Q_D(P,...)\\) and the market supply curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as \\(Q_S(P,...)\\). The quantity (units of a good) that firms in the market are willing to supply is a function of the price and other ‘background’ things. The total quantity that consumers in the market or willing to demand is a different function of the price of other things. We typically these ‘supply curve’, and ‘demand curve’, respectively, but I want to to think of these as functions that can shift. I don’t want you to write ‘demand went down’; that is ambiguous. The price where these quantities are equal is the ‘prevailing price in the market’. We build this up throughout the next sections in more detail. Getting back to the example… Empirical work has estimated the equations below, the estimated supply and demand curves expressed in dollars and millions of barrels, from an earlier period: \\[ Q_D = 85 - 0.4P \\: (D) \\] \\[ Q_S = 55 + 0.6P \\: (S) \\] Setting \\(Q_S=Q_D\\) and solving this yields: \\(85 - 0.4P=55+0.6P \\rightarrow P = 30, Q = 73\\) This approximates the 2000-2002 price So what accounted for price rise in 2008 to about US$130, and then fall to US$50 by March 2009? China and India’s economy grew, implying a growth in the world economy by 3-4% per year Various calculations imply that this represents a shifting out in the Demand curve from \\(Q_D = 85 - 0.4P\\) to: \\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\\] Side note: I think the ‘new demand’ curve comes from an approximation: if the world economy grew at 4% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it’s previous size. … thus the growth is \\(1.047^7=1.316\\). They assume oil’s demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112. Note that the text has a typo: equation 3 on page 40, the new demand, should read \\(Q=112-0.4P\\). With the same supply curve and the new demand curve we have \\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\\] \\[Q_S = 55 + 0.6P\\] This \\(\\rightarrow\\) solves to \\(P=57, Q=87\\) Furthermore, overall price inflation, US$ devaluation \\(\\rightarrow\\) accounts for about a price of US$94 So why was did the price move to $130? Other changes included: Speculation, other disruptions. Supply may have also shifted (political turmoil, new sources of energy, etc.) Do you know the current price of oil per barrel in USD and GBP? 2.17 More advanced material on causal inference -The mixtape, Scott Cunningham pp 18-22, and more Autor, MIT ‘Microeconomic theory and public policy’, lecture 2 We now consider the very very fundamental building blocks behind the (in)famous ‘neoclassical economics model.’ Accept these ’axioms and nearly everything flows from it! 2.18 Between first and second week; priority home-study Make sure you are following along. Can you answer the questions mentioned above and in the lecture? E.g., can you explain why (supply) demand curves slope (upwards) downwards? Can you solve a system of two equations (supply, demand) for an equilibrium price and quantity? What causes shifts versus movements along the demand curve? After week 1, before week 2 lectures, be sure you have read/understood all of the ‘handout’ and corresponding material up to this point. To prepare for the week 2 lectures, you should look ahead at the readings and handout material (below). In particular, read and consider the material on ‘preference axioms’, ‘utility functions’, and how the latter are depicted using indifference curves. These are difficult and somewhat abstract concepts; try to test your understanding and bring questions (or ask these on the VLE)! If you have time, please also start considering the budget constraints and conditions for consumer optimisation. In particular, the ‘bang for the buck’ condition is something you will want to look at closely to get your head around it. Note: Further sections to be added as we progress "],

Some motivation for these abstract ideas Consider a decision you recently made? Define this decision clearly; what were the options? How do you think you decided among these options? What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the same decision? If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same situation again. Do you think you’d make the same decision? Suppose I asked you: ‘State a rule that governs how people do make decisions’… I want this rule to be both Informative (it rules out at least some sets of choices) and Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule). Suppose I asked an apparently similar question: ‘State a rule that governs how people should make decisions’.. By ‘should’ I mean that they will not regret having made decisions in this way. If people did follow these rules, what would this imply and predict? Economists (and decision theorists/decision scientists) have specifically defined such rules in terms of ‘axioms about preferences’ They have started from these ‘reasonable axioms’ and followed their logical implications for individual choices, individual responses to changes in prices and income, market prices and quantities and their responses, ‘welfare’ and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc. The ‘Standard axioms’ (imply that) choices can be expressed by ‘individuals maximising utility functions subject to their budget constraints’. This yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc. We want to develop a model that can be used to show how we make choices or decisions. In the (neo) classical economics framework, your (optimising) choices are determined by two things: Preferences: what goods do you like? Constraints: how much money do you have, what are the prices of the goods you buy? 3.1 Utility Utility “The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity.” Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated, thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, ‘utility’, which is maximised. Utility from two goods We may specify a “utility function” of two goods (or aggregations of goods) \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\): \\[Utility = U(X,Y; other)\\] We can get a lot of insight from considering models Of an individual’s preferences over only two goods. These two ‘goods’ could represent, for example: Leisure and ‘goods consumption’ Food and non-food Coffee and tea (holding all else constant) Recall \\(U(X,Y)\\) expresses a function with two arguments, X and Y. \\(U(X,Y)\\) must take some value for every positive value of X and Y. In general a function of X and Y might increase or decrease in either X or Y, or increase over some ranges and decrease over other ranges of these two arguments. For example, consider the function ‘altitude of land in Britain as a function of degrees longitude and latitude’. \\(U(X,Y)\\) expresses a general function; I haven’t specified what this function is. E.g., it could be \\(U(X,Y)=\\sqrt(XY)\\). 3.2 Measuring and comparing utilities This is a difficult but well-studied issue, as it is important for methodology and welfare analysis. In more detailed discussions, we might speak of ‘cardinal utility’, ‘ordinal utility’, etc., to indicate the ways we can or cannot compare utility between individuals and in response to policy changes. Utility is not ‘observable and measurable in utils’ Utility is seen to govern an individual’s choices and thus it’s only inferred indirectly, from the choices people make Who gets ‘more’ utility? We don’t know. Also, considering a transfer from Al to Betty: Is the reduction in Al’s utility more or less than the increase in Betty’s? Revealed preference: if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a dog was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat. As we only get at utility through an individual’s decisions, we have no reliable way to compare it across individuals. Standard utility functions are only ‘identified’ (only make distinct predictions) ‘up to a monotonic transformation’ i.e., a ‘rank preserving’ transformation, like stretching a rubber band. E.g., multiply by a positive number, log, square, add/subtract from it; the new utility function makes the same predictions. The person will make the same decisions, so we cannot tell them apart. The “benefit” of this property: we can transform (e.g., log) a utility function for convenient calculation When we deal with uncertain choices, the ‘Von Neuman - Morgenstern’ utility functions will be somewhat more restrictive and better identified. If you believe people are really obeying the VMN axioms and thus maximising expected utility.10 3.3 Assumptions about preferences (‘axioms’) Technical note: The more formal and parsimonious definition (Autor readings, Jehle/Reny) develop this from a single relation ‘weakly preferred to’: \\(\\succsim\\). Completeness: Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive. Transitivity (internal consistency): If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C. More is Better (nonsatiation) Completeness and transitivity (and continuity) are necessary for people’s choices to be represented by (continuous) utility functions. Nonsatiation will help us derive results. 1. Completeness The following is forbidden: “I cannot choose between a ski holiday and a beach holiday, yet I am not indifferent between these.” Why wouldn’t I be able to express a preference? In the case above that seems strange, but for other cases it may be extremely difficult or painful to make a choice, or very hard to compare two things. Imagine if you were asked to choose between never seeing your mother or never seeing your father. In general, economists’ standard approach assumes we have a consistent preference ranking over all possibilities, and choose accordingly. Other social sciences see this differently/ Also ‘forbidden’ in the classical model: the time or frame in which I make the decisions must not affect my choices. This will be relaxed when we discuss behavioral economics. Formal notation: Either A preferred to B, B preferred to A, or A indifferent to B \\[A \\succ B, B \\succ A, \\: or \\: A \\sim B \\] Violations?: See, e.g., ‘Predicting Hunger: The Effects of Appetite and Delay on Choice’; Read and van Leeuwen, 1998* Is there really a clear ‘true preference’ here? See also Sunstein ad others on ‘choosing not to choose’ 2. Transitivity \\[ A \\succ B \\: and \\: B \\succ C \\rightarrow A \\succ C \\] If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer an Apple to a Cherry. A similar idea holds if I am indifferent between one pair of these. (\\(\\sim\\)) … this obviously extends to ‘chains’ combining these … so \\[ A \\succ B \\:\\: and \\: \\: B \\sim C \\rightarrow A \\succ C \\] etc. We may write this concisely as \\(A \\succ B \\sim C\\). If this seems confusing it may be because it is too obvious (although behavioral and experimental economists claim to find violations of this. Technical note: Formally, completeness of these \\(\\succ\\) and \\(\\sim\\), and the transitivity of each makes this a ‘Partial Ordering’ of the choice set. If you found someone who stricly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them!. In more detail… Intuitively: Transitive preferences are ‘internally consistent’: If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C. Loosely, I might expect this if I think that a person has preferences that can be ranked in a normal way. The standard ‘utility framework’ takes this for granted. If we have any rule over preference such as ‘more is better’ or ‘tastier is better’, this should hold. Also, someone whose makes choices following preferences that are not transitive may quickly be impoverished by a shrewd trader. We do not see this happening in general. If you found someone who strictly preferred a apple to a bananas, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple, you could make a lot of money out of them. This is easiest to illustrate if we allow these goods to be non-discrete and assume ‘more is always better.’ It works as follows: Obtain (or borrow) an apple, a banana and a cherry. Offer to give this person an apple in exchange for their banana plus a tiny little extra small unit of banana (or ‘money’). Next offer them a cherry for their apple plus a bit extra. Next offer a banana for their cherry plus a bit extra. … Keep repeating steps 1-3, until you’ve drained all of their resources. (Final) Exam question: What are ‘transitive preferences’? Give an example of a person making choices that seem to reflect preferences that are transitive, and explain how you could ‘pump money’ from this person. Ans:11 Violations of transitivity?: see (inter alia) Loomes, Graham, Chris Starmer, and Robert Sugden. “Observing violations of transitivity by experimental methods.” Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society (1991): 425-439. Choi, Syngjoo, et al. “Who is (more) rational?.” The American Economic Review 104.6 (2014): 1518-1550. 3. More is better (‘global nonsatiation’) Perhaps this seems unreasonable? One way you might justify it: If the product is a ‘bad’ (e.g., pollution), redefine the product as the absence of the product. The darkly shaded area above represents those combinations of X and Y that are unambiguously preferred to the combination X*, Y*. This is why goods are called ‘goods’; individuals prefer having more of any good rather than less. Combinations of X and Y in the lightly shaded area are inferior to the combination \\(X^{\\ast}, Y^{\\ast}\\), whereas those in the questionable areas may or may not be superior to \\(X^{\\ast}, Y^{\\ast}\\). Who cares? If people obey the first two above assumptions/axioms, the completeness and transitivity\\(\\ast\\), they will make choices in a way consistent with maximising a (continuous) utility function. (… OK, maybe you still don’t care, but economists do.) Technical note: * Technically, these conditions are necessary but not sufficient. Adding ‘Continuity’ of preferences yields a sufficient condition, and also guarantees continuous utility functions and demand curves without strange jumps). The third axiom (nonsatiation) makes the maths more convenient, and is necessary for some results/predictions, like establishing that an outcome allows a ‘Pareto improvement’. Strictly, most results only require ‘local nonsatiation’; starting from any consumption point, increasing the amount of *some good by a tiny \\(\\epsilon\\) amount will yield a preferred point. This will yield results like ‘people will spend all of their wealth’ and ‘(roughly) people will never buy a more expensive bundle when a cheaper bundle is preferred.’ We are not saying people actually consult a utility function. That would be a dumb thing to say. We are considering that ‘people behave as if they are maximizing utility functions’; this is (basically) equivalent to saying \"people choose based on preferences that satisfy the above assumptions. These axioms stand directly behind ‘revealed preference’ methods for measuring how much people value nonmarket goods, like clean air and national parks. It also gives us a vocabulary and a way to test for violations of this consistency, and make alternate predictions. On continuity of preferences Continuity: If \\(A \\succ B\\) and \\(C\\) ’lies within an \\(\\epsilon\\) radius of \\(B\\) then \\(A \\succ C\\). Adding this to the previous axioms \\(\\rightarrow\\) a utility representation; these are jointly sufficient conditions. Continuous preferences will also ensure continuous utility functions and allow us to discuss concepts such as ‘marginal utility’ and ensure and gradually sloping demand curves. Note that everywhere-differentiable utility functions are obviously continuous. Tough question – what preferences might we describe (given below) that are actually not continuous? Answer:12 An interesting case A leading counterexample: ‘lexicographic’ preferences E.g., if I have lexicographic preference over houses each category of a house is considered in order. I may prefer the largest house no matter what. If both houses are the same size, I prefer the house closest to my work. If both are the same size and equidistant from work, I prefer the house with more sunlight, etc. This is not continuous; consider two houses of 800 sq ft, but A is 1 mile closer to my work than B. The ‘epsilon-ball’ around the characteristics of B must include the characteristic 800+\\(\\epsilon\\) square feet. But any such house would be preferred to A. In fact, lexicographic preferences (in a continuous product space) cannot be represented by a utility function. Diminishing marginal returns, or (in multiple dimensions, without requiring differentiability, ‘quasiconcavity’) will also be necessary for certain results. How can we compare the “?” areas? Which are preferred? \\(\\rightarrow\\) Compare utilities, depict this using Indifference Curves 3.4 Indifference curves Indifference curve A curve that shows all the combinations of goods or services that provide the same level of utility. Formally (for 2 goods), the set of pairs of \\({X,Y}\\) such that \\(U(X,Y)=c\\) for some constant c.13 Autor: &gt; Define a level of utility say \\(U(x) = U\\). Then, the indifference curve for U, \\(IC(U)\\) is the locus of consumption bundles that generate utility level U for utility function \\(U(x)\\). Consider the above diagram.14 Think of this as a map with a projection above it. How far East you go on this map determines how much of the x good is consumed How far North you go determines how much of the Y good is consumed. How high is the projected image… Determines how much utility is obtained from this combination of goods X and Y.15 The above diagram also includes color to depict the utility level, like a ‘heat map.’16 Properties of indifference curves Figure 3.1: indifference curves Note for above: Suppose you are someone that likes hamburgers and soft drinks. If this is too difficult to imagine, think of two healthy goods, like runner beans and green tea. Note that the period of consumption—a day, a year, or a lifetime—is not specified. Comprehension Q: Rank order of preference between points A-E using the formal notation (Answers to most comprehension questions are given in footnotes. Try to answer it yourself before looking at the footnote.)17 Q: How do we know \\(E \\succ B\\) ?18 Q: How do we know \\(E \\succ A\\) ?19 Even though these concepts are rather abstract, we can already apply this to an interesting question that has been central to economics throughout history. Why is there ‘voluntary trade’ (between individuals)? This gives us insight into why people trade with one another. Considering figure 3.1 (above and in the NS text), an individual is ok with giving up soda for hamburgers or vice/versa along her indifference curve. A trade that put her above the IC makes her ‘strictly’ better off. So consider if one individual had allocation D and another allocation A, and they had the same preferences. What trade could they make to make each of them better off? Note that the line between two bundles depicts all ‘convex combinations’ of these \\(\\alpha\\) of D and \\(1-\\alpha\\) of A, where \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\). In normal-speak, a partial share of each bundle. We can see that with the same DMRS for both, trades along this line make both better off; the points they would trade to depends on their bargaining power. They might also trade in a way that puts one below this line but still above the original indifference curve. 3.5 Marginal rate of substitution (MRS): Absolute value of slope of indifference curve The MRS measures the maximum amount of one good (\\(Y\\)) that you would be willing to give up in order to gain one more unit of another good (\\(X\\)). I.e., this would be the amount you could give up of \\(Y\\) when you gain one unit of \\(X\\) and be no worse or better off. You are ‘indifferent’ to making this change. This slope will equal the negative of the ratio of the rate at which utility increases in each good (partial derivative). Intuition: giving up a certain utility from one good must be balanced by an increase in utility from the other good. So the MRS is the ratio itself, because it’s the absolute value.) Formally, the MRS at point \\(X,Y\\), where \\(U(X,Y)=U_1\\) is: \\(MRS(X,Y)=-\\frac{dY}{dX}|U(X,Y)=U_1\\), the absolute value of the total derivative of Y with respect to X, holding utility constant Returning to fig 3.1: Moving from A to B: She is willing to give up 2 burgers to get 1 more soda. \\(\\rightarrow\\) Here the slope \\(-2\\), implying a \\(MRS=2\\)20 From B to C? (think about it) willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1 more soda \\(\\rightarrow MRS =1\\) C to D? \\(MRS = \\frac{1}{2}\\) (Here this refers to ‘arc slopes’, not precisely the slope at points tangent to the curve.)21 Note the decline in the MRS as she gets more hamburgers (and fewer sodas): this ‘diminishing MRS’ is a common assumption… this may reflect satiation; as she gets more and more hamburgers each one adds incrementally less to her utility (because she grows tired of them.) Careful: it is very easy to get the numerator and denominator wrong in computing the MRS. Find a way to remember this for yourself. Preference for variety/balance This ‘preference for variety’ is thought to hold for most combinations of goods, most of the time, but probably not for all pairings^[This assumption generally makes it easier to find solutions where people consume both goods, and will imply smooth reactions to price changes. An extreme case is where each good is an ‘absolute necessity’, so as its consumption goes to zero its marginal utility goes to infinity; here people must consume some of each good no matter the price. With an indifference curve with this shape (‘convex’) any consumption bundle that represents a ‘mixture’ between two equally attractive extremes will be preferred to those extremes.22 E.g., if I like bundles A and D equally, I prefer a bundle of 1/3 of A and 2/3 of D to either A or D. How do I know the line connecting these points describes such mixtures? You can see by defining these formally and plotting this line… in multiple dimensions this is a plane or ‘hyperplane’. More inuitively, consider that the slope of this line represents the slope of the difference in these bundles: ‘the reduction in hamburgers divided by the increase in soft drinks’. (Equivalently, in giving up a share of the upper left bundle to gain the lower right bundle, the number of soft drinks one gains for each hamburger sacrificed.) In giving up a certain share of one bundle to gain a share of the other bundle I am reducing my consumption of one good to gain another good at a constant linear rate. Here, I need to move from 6 to 2 hamburgers and from 2 to 6 soft drinks. The slope of this is just one (6-2/6-2) in this case, as seen in the dashed line. More formal concept: quasiconcavity More formal concept: (strictly) convex preferences \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) (strictly) ‘quasiconcave’ utility function, allowing ‘n goods’: This essentially means that for a ‘convex combination’ of any two bundles \\(\\mathbf{A}=(X_A,Y_A)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{D}=(X_D,Y_D)\\) \\[U(\\alpha\\mathbf{A}+(1-\\alpha)\\mathbf{D})\\geq\\alpha U(\\mathbf{A}) + (1-\\alpha)U(\\mathbf{D})\\] where \\(0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1\\). (Note the switch to a ‘weak inequality’ here for quasiconcavity, strict for ‘strict quasiconcavity’) E.g. (with two goods), \\[U(\\alpha X_A + (1-\\alpha)X_D,\\alpha Y_A + (1-\\alpha)Y_D) \\geq \\] \\[\\alpha(U((X_A,Y_A)) + (1-\\alpha)(U(X_D,Y_D)\\] where \\(0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1\\). One reason economists like this ‘quasiconcavity’ is because it rules out the ‘false summits’, the local, but not global optima, so we only need to use the first-order conditions to find the optima. (But is this ‘looking under the streetlight to find our keys’ or is it truly without loss of generality?) Note that ‘quasiconcavity’ does not require differentiability, and it is preserved under a ‘monotonic transformation’ (stretching). This means it is called an ‘ordinal property’. Essentially, quasiconcave utility functions yields indifference curves that are ‘convex to the origin’. All relevant properties of utility functions are unchanged by such monotonic transformations, including the MRS. This is well-illustrated in Autor’s reading (Lecture 3, pp 11-14) Indifference curve map This looks like the special case of ‘homothetic preferences’: these have the same slopes as you shift them outward. I.e., the slopes only depend on the ratios of each good, implying that consumption of each good expands proportionally in income and the impact of a single-consumer’s income increasing by 1 million dollars will be the same as 1 million consumers’ incomes increasing by 1 dollar; this assumption underlies ‘representative consumer’ models. Key principles: Indifference curves never cross never slope upwards and they have zero thickness 3.6 Illustrating particular preferences N&amp;S give some examples of preference which violate some of the above assumptions and do not exhibit diminishing MRS. Further notes on the above diagram: Smoke grinders are useless: violates ‘more is better’; this good can be ignored. Houseflies are a bad. (But housefly reduction is a good). Two types of petrol: perfect substitutes (at 1:1); no preference for variety. Left and right shoes are perfect complements in 1:1 proportions; no benefit to more of one without the other; consumed in exact proportions. Product positioning in marketing This is discussed in NS App 2.3 Do people have a preference for balance? (Convex indifference curves)? If market research suggests a broad group indifferent between A and D (in fig 2.3), they may strictly prefer G, by this argument. \\(\\rightarrow\\) a possible niche for a new profitable product ? But what may be a critique, exception to this logic, e.g., for a particular food? Some suggested answers, others are reasonable…23 Convex preferences, ‘preferring mixtures’ is a very strong assumption, unlikely to hold everywhere, or for actual mixtures. I may be indifferent between liver and custard, but it doesn’t mean that I prefer liver-flavoured custard, nor even necessarily equal amounts of liver and custard side by side. Producing an ‘intermediate’ attribute may be more costly; it may be easy to make crunchy but low-taste cereal or tasty but low-crunch cereal, but expensive to make a cereal with both attributes. E.g., hard to make a car that is spacious and fast. Utility/indifference curves: Also a framework for marketing analysis The utility and indifference curve construct may seem highly theoretical. Indeed, these models were developed largely to address big questions like ‘who gains from trade?’ Still, it helps organise thinking and analysis for at least some managers and marketing groups. According to the text, Marriot hotel used focus groups to ‘construct (multidimensional) indifference curves’ to consider their ideal product positioning. I have seen a similar presentation for other hotels presented at Behavioural boozeonomics in London.} 3.7 Definitions: Perfect substitutes and complements Perfect substitutes Goods A and B are Perfect Substitutes when an individual’s utility is linear in these goods when she is always willing to trade off A for B at a fixed rate (not necessarily 1 for 1) Perfect complements Goods A and B are Perfect Complements when an individual only gains utility from (more) A if she also consumes a defined (additional) amount of B, and vice-versa These goods are ‘enjoyed only in fixed proportions’. E.g., left and right shoes (1:1) bicycle frames and wheels (1:2) or, perhaps, baking powder and flour (1:40) for someone who only eats soda bread.24 3.8 Choices are subject to constraints You cannot spend more than your (lifetime) income/wealth \\(\\rightarrow\\) budget constraint. Consider the budget constraint given in the figure below. Figure 3.2: Budget constraint for two goods Budget constraint for two goods, slope \\(-P_x/P_y\\) Notes: For example, think ‘food’ and ‘nonfood’. Budget constraint algebra I realise this may be trivial for many of you, but others will find this a helpful refresher. If I spend all my income (which I should do over a ‘relevant lifetime’), then: Expenditure on X + Expenditure on Y = Income (I) \\[P_X X + P_Y Y = I \\] To see how \\(Y\\) trades off against \\(X\\), rearrange this to: \\[Y = -\\frac{P_X}{P_Y} X + \\frac{I}{P_Y}\\] Intercept: \\(\\frac{I}{P_Y}\\), i.e., amount of Y you can buy if you only buy Y Slope: \\(-\\frac{P_X}{P_Y}\\), i.e., how much Y you must give up to get another unit of X Notes and intuition: The slope \\(-P_X/P_Y\\): How much \\(Y\\) I must sacrifice to get another unit of \\(X\\), expressed as a negative number.25 To get another unit of \\(X\\) it costs me \\(P_xX\\), so the more costly is \\(X\\) the more \\(Y\\) I must give up. For each unit of \\(Y\\) I give up I save \\(P_Y\\), so the more costly is \\(Y\\) the more I can save by giving up 1 unit of it, thus, the less I need to sacrifice of \\(Y\\) to get another unit of \\(X\\). 3.9 Constrained utility maximization We started with an individual’s preferences, one of the baseline elements of the neoclassical model. Under some conditions these can be described by utility functions, which we depicted graphically as ‘mountains’ with levels sets depicted by indifference curves. So, we have a way of depicting what people prefer, but this doesn’t tell us what people will choose to consume (and firms to produce). We next introduced the second fundamental element of the neoclassical model, constraints, in particular, the budget constraint. We put these together to describe the consumer’s problem: maximizing her utility subject to her budget constraints. This is depicted in figure 2.7 below for the two-good case. Imagine that you are this consumer with these preferences and this budget constraint. You can choose any point in the shaded area, as it is on or below your budget constraint. You want to get to the highest indifference curve. Consider: How do we know A is suboptimal (i.e., NOT optimal)? What about B? Points between B and C? We can demonstrate that you will choose point C, yielding utility \\(U_2\\). What is special about point C? It’s the point of tangency between the budget constraint and an indifference curve. It’s also (not a coincidence) the point where the slopes are equal. Slope of budget constraint = slope of indifference curve \\(\\rightleftarrows\\)26 \\[P_X/P_Y = MRS\\] Note that both slopes are negative, so both negative signs cancel out, leaving this condition. Warning: The above is shorthand; recall that the marginal rate of substitution may vary everywhere along an indifference curve (remember the idea of satiation and diminishing MRS). It is a function of the point it is evaluated, i.e., \\(MRS = MRS(X,Y)\\). It is only at the point where the consumer is optimizing that these slopes must be equal. They can also be equal at some other suboptimal points, where she is not spending all of her income, or if the indifference curves have a shape very different from the one above (more or less, where they are not ‘convex’). Where she is consuming some of every good, this is a necessary condition for such a point to represent an optimal consumption choice, but it may not be a sufficient condition. May also be optimal for her to consume none of certain goods, in which case this condition will not hold. We return to this later. At an optimal consumption choice (given above assumptions, see above footnote) Consume all of income (locate on budget line; follows from ‘more is better’) Psychic tradeoff (MRS) equals market tradeoff (\\(P_X/P_Y\\)) Intuition: If I can give up X for Y in the market (buy less X, get more Y) at a certain rate, and the benefit I get from doing this is at a different rate, I can make myself better off. Thus the original point could not have been optimal! Think about this carefully; it is a key method of proving things in economic theory called ‘proof by contradiction’. Example, for intuition Suppose that at the consumption bundle you choose your MRS = 1. To remain indifferent, you would be willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1 soda. Suppose the price of soda is £1 and the price of a burger is £2. \\(\\rightarrow\\) Price ratio: \\(P_S/P_B = 1/2\\) Thus if you buy one less burger you can buy two more sodas. Thus if you give up one burger, you can get one more soda to keep you indifferent plus an additional soda. This means you would be better off; thus the original bundle wasn’t optimal. Practice question: in which direction would you adjust this bundle if the price of a soda was £2 and a hamburger was £1? Explain. More insight into MRS Recall \\(U=U(X,Y)\\). \\[U_X(X,Y) := MU_X(X,Y)\\] Derivative with respect to X: rate that utility increases if we add a little X, holding Y constant Similarly for \\(MU_Y\\). It turns out the MRS at a point is the ratio of these marginal utilities. MRS: ‘how much Y would I be willing to give up to get a unit of X’? Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each … we can show \\(MRS(X,Y)=\\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\\) Mathy intuition: The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point – the higher is \\(MU_X\\) – the more Y I am willing to give up to get it. That is why \\(MU_X\\) is in the numerator. The more valuable a bit more Y is at that point – the higher is \\(MU_Y\\) – the less Y I am willing to give up to get a bit more X. That is why \\(MU_Y\\) is in the denominator. The ‘first order change in utility’ (or ‘total differential’) is: \\[ dU = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X}dX + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Y}dY\\] \\[ = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY\\] Where \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X}\\) refers to the partial derivative of U(X,Y) with respect to X, and similarly for Y, i.e., the marginal utility. Essentially, this approximates the total change in utility for very small changes in X and Y. Setting it equal to zero and rearranging it yields the rate, at the margin, one is willing to give up Y for X: \\[dU = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY = 0 \\] \\[\\frac{dY}{dX}=-\\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}\\] Tech note: This is a simple case of the implicit function theorem. Essentially \\(U(X,Y)=c\\) defines an implicit function \\(Y(X)\\), whose slope is the negative of the ratio of the derivatives. Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields more intuition: \\[P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y\\] (at each consumption point X,Y) \\[\\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}.\\] I.e., the same ‘bang for each buck’. Note: If this didn’t hold true and you were spending on both goods, you would be paying ‘more per util’ for one good than the other, and thus should reallocate to that other good. 3.10 Note on ‘corner solutions’ The above applies to any interior solution If you are consuming both goods and optimising, \\(P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y\\) must hold This is a “necessary but not sufficient condition”, sufficient if there is a diminishing MRS everywhere. But you might consume none of some good (say X): if even with no X, \\(MU_X/P_X&lt;MU_Y/P_Y\\) i.e., the marginal utility of the first unit of X is less than that of Y we will see examples of this (maths and graphically). The same condition applies to each good you are consuming a positive amount of. 3.11 Enrichment, ‘applications’ Enrichment (formal) The constrained problem is equivalent to optimising a single unconstrained ‘Lagrangian’ function See Autor notes (Lecture 4: Theory of Choice and Individual Demand) This yields the above optimisation (first-order) conditions but only where solutions are positive; there are additional non-negativity constraints, \\(\\rightarrow\\) should use Kuhn-Tucker ‘complementary slackness’ conditions; however, if an unconstrained problem yields a solution that doesn’t violate the contraint, we can ignore it. Figure 3.3: From Autor notes NS App 2.4: ticket scalping Suppose tickets are rationed: one per customer. This constraint (which is additional to the budget constraint) implies lower utility; the individual depicted above would choose A if unconstrained. Here the budget line is not tangent to indifference curve; the slopes are not equal. The individual would be better off buying more tickets, but she cannot. She would be willing to buy an additional ticket at full price (move to point C). Actually, she would be willing to pay more than full price for a second ticket. (See previous final exams and textbook questions asking, e.g., ‘how much would she be willing to pay?’) She could give up up to an additional C-D of goods for ticket 2 and still be as well off. Tougher questions: Why would NFL institute this rule? Who benefits? (Maybe poor consumers?) Why do people see scalping as unfair? Is there ever a justification to forbid a transaction between 2 consenting parties? NS App 2.5: What’s a rich uncle’s promise worth? Note: Willie would choose point A with his original income, but his uncle paid him $5k to abstain from sinful goods. If he accepts this and only consumes ‘other goods’, this would get him to point B, gaining him \\(U_3\\). But now suppose that his uncle reneged on the promise, so he is at point C. Graphically, how much $ would have been enough to compensate for abstaining? Harder question, foreshadowing future concepts like the inefficiency of in-kind subsidies… How much would Willie need to be paid to get him to \\(U_3\\) without the restriction? Is this more or less than $5k? 3.12 Different sorts of preferences, optimisation examples Why do people spend their money on different things? What do different preferences/indifference curves imply for choices? This will presumably be simple for you to understand… but in case you need revision, please see the powerpoint here; view it in presenter mode. What indicates each persons’ preference for one good over the other? The shape of the indifference curve. The flatter (steeper) the indifference curve the stronger the preference for the good on the Y-axis (X-axis) Algebraic/numerical examples Perfect substitutes, but not identical Consider: are the following ‘perfect substitutes’ for someone who wants caffeine, but has no taste buds? Yes, they are! Recall the definition of perfect substitutes. By ‘perfect substitutes’ we mean pairs of goods for which some amount of one is always valued the same as some amount of the other, and this proportion is always the same. An easy example: I might always be indifferent between three pints of mild ale and two pints of strong ale, if they have the same total alcohol content and I only want to get tipsy. So (for perfect substitutes) buy the one that increases it more per-£. Warning: Remember, if goods are not perfect substitutes, marginal utility ratios (thus, marginal rates of substitution) generally depend on consumption levels. Numerical example: \\[U(X,Y)=4X+3Y\\] Rate at which each good (X and Y) increases utility per-unit (derivative) is constant \\(MU_X = 4\\), so every additional unit of X will add four units of utility in this example, no matter what the starting point is. \\(MU_Y = 3\\), … so every unit of Y will add 3 units… So (for perfect substitutes) the consumer will buy the one that increases utility more per-£ Compare \\(MU_X/P_X\\) to \\(MU_Y/P_Y\\) Here, if \\(4/P_X &gt; 3/P_Y\\), then buy X. if \\(4/P_X &lt; 3/P_Y\\), then buy Y (if equal, buy either) Rearranging, if \\(P_X &lt; 4/3 P_Y\\), buy X … etc. (I sometimes call this the “bang for the buck” condition.) Perfect complements AKA ‘Leontief preferences’ Numerical example: \\[U(X,Y)=min(2X,Y)\\] E.g., where X is bicycle frames and Y bicycle wheels. Warning:27 Shortcut: figure out the proportions it will be consumed in determine the cost of ‘one bundle of the combination’ at given prices … then buy as many such bundles as you can afford You should be able to do this without having taken economics. Suppose you were given £100 and asked to spend it to make as many sausages-with-baps as possible. No one can eat a sausage without a bap, nor vice-versa. Sausages come in packs of 4, and baps come in packs of 8. How many packs of each will you buy, supposing both types of packs cost £1 each? Middle-ground A Cobb-Douglas example Recall, as I noted above, that for the “general” rather than extreme cases the marginal rate of substitution at a particular point may vary everywhere, and depends on the amount of each good consumed. Below the “Cobb-Douglas” functional form is one example of such a ‘middle ground’ utility function, expressing neither perfect substitutes and are perfect complements. A simple case of this Cobb-Douglas utility is:28 \\[ U(X,Y)=\\sqrt(XY) \\] We are ‘allowed’ to square the whole thing to simplify the problem. Why? Utility is only “identified up to a monotonic transformation”. In general you can transform the utility function in any way that preserves the ordering of preferences over the combinations of X and Y. (E.g., multiply/divide it by any positive amount, add any constant, take it to any power, put it into an exponential or large transformationx… Doing this, replacing utility function with this “new” utility function will have no impact on the choices the person makes. The only thing that will change is the realized level utility, which is not a meaningful concept. However, this will no longer hold later in the module when we consider uncertainty and expected utility. Amount of Y you’d give up to get a unit of X: \\[MRS(X,Y)= MU_X/MU_Y = Y/X\\] Note: The last equality comes from this particular function; it is not always Y/X. Note also that this is the same as ’the amount of Y you’d need to give up a unit of X Checking your work: is this solution reasonable? The more Y I have, the more I am willing to give up to get a unit of X. This seems reasonable, as it reflects satiation. We can derive this slope. \\(MU_X\\) is the slope of \\(U(X,Y)\\) in X at a particular point, i.e., the (partial) derivative with respect to X \\(MU_X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} (XY)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2} (XY)^{-1/2}Y = \\frac{1}{2} (Y/X)^{1/2}\\) Similarly, \\(MU_Y = \\frac{1}{2}(X/Y)^{1/2}\\). Note:29 In general, the marginal rate of substitution (at a point) is the ratio of the marginal utilities at that point. Here30 (for this Cobb-Douglas), utility-maximization requires, at optimal choices of X and Y: \\[MRS(X,Y)= Y/X = P_X/P_Y\\] Check that it makes sense: As \\(P_X\\) increases, the right-hand-side (RHS) increases, and so to increase the left-hand-side (LHS) I must increase the units of Y consumed, and thus decrease the units of X consumed. Thus as \\(P_X\\) increases I consume more units of X and less Y, which is what you might expect for a standard case. For any price ratio, you can find the ratio of units of Y &amp; X consumed. Then, if you know the prices and total income \\(I\\), you can calculate the consumption and spending on X and Y Rearranging the optimization condition: \\[Y P_Y = X P_X\\] Question: What is weird about this condition, for this example31 Combining this with the budget constraint \\[P_X X + P_Y Y = I\\] we can now solve for amounts of X and Y purchased, as functions of prices and income. Calculations: Rearranging the optimization condition, \\(Y = X P_X/P_Y\\). From the budget constraint, \\(X = (I - P_Y Y)/P_X\\). Substituting in for Y yields \\(X = (I - P_Y(X P_X / P_Y))/P_X = I/P_X - X\\) \\(\\rightarrow 2X = I/P_X \\rightarrow X = I/(2P_X)\\) \\(X P_X = I / 2 \\rightarrow\\) this person always spends half her income on X.32 Advanced shortcut tip:33 3.13 Generalisations Complicated (e.g., nonlinear) pricing and budget constraints Many goods; when can I consider all other goods as a ‘composite good’? Cobb-Douglas general form \\[U(X,Y)=X^aY^b\\] where a, b are positive constants Aside note: This is “homothetic”: Homothetic: MRS constant along a ray through the origin. \\(\\rightarrow\\) It can be represented by an HD1 utility function. This ties down ‘income effects’ in a boring way: consumption of each good expands proportionally in income. This if everyone has these preferences impact of 1 consumer’s income increasing by £1 million is the same as 1 million consumers gaining £1. This underlies ‘representative consumer’ models. …so the poor man just buys a tiny amount of foies gras and jumps in his tiny money bin \\[MU_X=\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X} = aX^{a-1}Y^b\\] \\[MU_Y=\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Y} = bX^{a}Y^b-1\\] Taking the ratio of these yields \\[MRS = \\frac{a}{b}\\frac{Y}{X}\\] So only the ratio Y/X affects the MRS; double both, MRS is the same. Another relevant example: ‘Constant Elasticity of Substitution preferences’ A non-homothetic (here, ‘Quasilinear’) example \\[U(X,Y)=X+ln(Y)\\] Here Y has a diminishing MU, but for X MU is constant \\[\\frac{MU_X}{MU_Y}= \\frac{1}{1/Y}=Y\\] So the MRS diminishes as Y increases, but it is independent of the amount of X consumed. Q: So, if we double both then (class question)?34 This represents Quasilinear preferences: These are particularly relevant with three or more goods. More generally, quasilinear utility satisfies \\(U=x_1+f(x_2,...,x_n)\\); i.e., it is linear in one ‘numeraire’ good \\(x_1\\). Here, the amount of the ‘non-numeraire goods’ consumed adjust to match the price ratio but don’t depend on the income. We imagine that ‘the tradeoff between these goods is the same for people of all income levels’ E.g., iin principal-agent analysis we can then ignore the question ‘but won’t the preference for leisure change when people are richer’? Mathy intuition: if the ‘Y’ goods \\((x2,..., xn)\\) have more MU consume them ‘first’, until their MU diminishes to that of the numeraire, then consume X. Note that budget constraints need not be linear From NS App 2.6: Loyalty programmes Notes: Purchases in excess of \\(X_D\\) are at a lower price. Unlikely price programme which exactly makes consumer indifferent. Lower slope after \\(X_D\\): still locate at A, higher slope: buy larger quantity.35 Should Economists care how the mind works? from NS 2.2 application Should we Look to biology, psychology, cognitive science for key principles/modeling? There is evidence of systematic departures from maximization of a consistent and standard utility function - E.g., treating some prices differently and ignoring information - Self-control and ‘paying not to go to the gym’ Should we describe/model optimizing behavior or ‘typical behavioral patterns’? Arguments for each; see ‘Behavioral Economics’ There are good arguments for understanding what optimising behavior would look like and what it would predict even if it might not always be descriptive. There is also good evidence that people’s behavior is inconsistent with a very simple maximization and is sometimes ‘predictably irrational’ (although I hate to use the word ’irrational). We will return to this when we discuss behavioral economics. More specifically, e.g., : people may have psychological costs/benefits relating to outcomes other than their own final consumption. They may care about others’ consumption (altruism etc.), about the way they make the decision, and about how close they come to certain goals (‘reference points’ and ‘loss aversion’). They may realize their own short-term choices are not in their long term interest, and try to constrain themselves They may also find it mentally costly and time-consuming to carefully calculate the costs and benefits, and thus exhibit ‘rational inattention’ They may choose to follow simple rules or ‘heuristics’ to make their decisions easier; e.g., ‘I will work every day until I have earned a target income’. 3.14 Doctoral-prep concepts Some examples of things you may need to learn and use for a PhD micro module, (although only a small subset of economists actually use this in their research!). You will not be directly examined on this in the present module. Another taste, nice UCLA notes here As noted, standard utility functions are defined up to ‘monotonic transformations’. We can derive proofs of the invariance of the implied preferences to these. More formal (and multivariable) representations of the preference axioms, nvolving a bit of set theory (e.g., open and closed sets). A formal definition and proof of the idea that a utility function ‘represents’ preferences. Exercises like ‘show that lexicographic preferences cannot be represented by a continuous utility function’ What conditions on a (multivariate) utility function ensure it exhibits the equivalent of a diminishing marginal rates of substitution? - Something called ‘quasi-concavity’, equivalent to ‘having convex upper contour sets’ Representation of the MRS between all goods as a matrix, depicting the properties of this Strict quasi-concavity takes the place of DMRS in ensuring ‘simple optimisation conditions’ 3.15 Tutorial/practice problems: see VLE, or watch this space The Autor reading refers to Cardinal versus Ordinal utility. We use the latter in demand/consumer theory.↩ Transitivity (internal consistency): If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C. If ‘Intransitive Eddy’ is offered 1 apple and 1 banana and 1p, he chooses the apple. If he is offered 1 banana versus 1 cherry and 1p, he chooses the banana. If he is offered 1 cherry versus 1 apple and 1p, he chooses the cherJjji Pump money from him: Buy an apple, a banana, and a cherry. Get him to buy a banana from you. Get him pay you 1p to trade his banana for your apple. Then get him to pay 1p to trade his apple for your cherry. Then get him to pay 1p to trade his cherry for your banana.
