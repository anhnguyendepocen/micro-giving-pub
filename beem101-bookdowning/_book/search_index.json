We have considered price-elasticity, income and substitution effects, the impact of price on revenue (expenditure), etc. With charitable donations this is not so clear cut: What is the ‘price’ and what is the ‘output consumed’? This depends on what benefits the potential donors gain from giving, and how they perceive this. As charity is largely a creedence good, donors may not get direct and accurate feedback between the activities (outputs) and achievements (outcomes) of the these. This chapter deals with several aspects of price and effectiveness: Prices expressed matches and rebates to donors/gifts Charity ratings that do not directly measure per-dollar impact (but overall governance) Responses to ‘Overhead’ information, a common measure that does not do a good job of explaining a donor’s marginal impact on outcomes Impact on (outputs and) outcomes per dollar; responses to scientific analytical information The latter is arguably the most important measure for donors who are striving to ‘do the most good’ with their donations. 1.1 Price of giving: Impact of matches To justify a tax break, a price elasticity of 1 or greater (more elastic) is considered the ‘gold standard’. Otherwise this policy leads the government to forgo more in taxes than it raises in terms of charitable contributions. There are many ‘observational data’ papers on how charitable giving responds to changes in the ‘tax price’ The results vary greatly across studies, although there is a very weak consensus around unit elasticity But these are arguably ‘poorly identified’: income and tax rates tend to move together And the effect of private ‘matches’ may be different So we might turn to field experiments Karlan and List: “Does Price Matter in charitable giving…” (2007, AER) Issue: Marginal illusion; Match comes with a Maximum. What if it is met? In practice….it is often met by definition Returns from 50,000 mailings 2% response rate 300 controls (1.8% response) 735 treatments: about 245 of each (2.2% response) Finding 1: Extensive effect - The existence of a match increased propensity to give by 22% Finding 2: Extensive effect: Match alone increased donation from $0.81 to $0.97 per mailing. Increase of 19% Finding 3: No intensive margin effect of the match on d, out-of-pocket donation, (but g, charity receipt per mailing, rose a lot with match, all the way to $3.75 per mailing.) Finding 5: No effect of limits; Marginal illusion or not? “Match ratios have no additional impact” Huck and Rasul “Matched fundraising: Evidence from a natural field experiment,” J Public Econ 2011, Andreoni summary Huck and Rasul (2011; Bavarian State Opera, program to benefit local disadvantaged). 60k leadership gift: Announced 0.5-1 match (60k match cap; truthful, real differences, or misleading information?) 1-1 match Conditions: C: Control, No mention of leadership gift L: Leadership gift mentioned, but not match M1: L + a 0.5 to 1 match is stated M2: L + a 1 to 1 match is stated C vs L isolate the effect of a leadership gift L vs M1 and M2 isolate the effect of match Findings: All the increase is due to the Leadership gift Matches actually have a dominating income effect. Higher matches lower d (amount sacrificed). That is, g (amount received) is inelastic wrt p. Charities would be better off just announcing the lead gift and having no match. So, it seems the ‘price of giving’ doesn’t matter in a conventional way in ‘matching contributions’ Caveats to both studies: special samples; self selection of “who opens envelope”) but this should resemble selection for real interventions in similar contexts 1.2 Framing of match: match versus rebate Eckel and Grossman, 2008 (ExpEcon), how do theoretically equivalent rebates and matching grants affect donations? “A rebate subsidy of \\(s_r\\) and a matching subsidy of rate \\(s_m\\) = \\(s_r/(1 - s_r)\\) present a donor with the same net cost of giving to the charity and therefore should result in the same level of giving” REBATE: pledge $1 to Minnesota Public Radio, later receive a partial refund (e.g., $0.20) from the authors of the study. MATCHING: $1.00 matched by an additional donation (e.g. $0.25) to MPR by the researchers. Random allocation: (1) No subsidy, (2) Match 25%, (3) Match 1/3, (4) Rebate 20%, (5) Rebate 25% Matching grants raise more than equivalent rebates in this study (echoes previous lab results) Price elasticities are roughly one and one-half to three times as large as for the rebate subsidy 1.3 Info/comms: Does information (about recipients/charity…) help? Fong, C., Oberholzer-Gee, F., Truth in giving: Experimental evidence on the welfare effects of informed giving to the poor, J. Public Econ. (2010) dictators from the university community [Carnegie-Mellon] Real-life welfare recipients living in 178 public housing in Pittsburgh Choice treatment: Can choose to pay $1 to learn about subject’s drug/disability Exogenous: this information is provided freely. (Also tested with comparable $9 endowment) “both types of recipients are worse off when dictators can choose to learn” … [but] dictators are weakly better off by construction “In the endogenous information treatment, we not only ask dictators how much they want to give to a poor person, we also encourage them to think about why the recipients are poor, possibly highlighting reasons not to give” \"a third of subjects are willing to sacrifice resources to obtain additional information But it’s not a fair comparison: those who decide not to buy information appear less generous than the average 1 Eyeballing their results on exogenous information (e.g., regression table 4) It increases transfers to the disabled by about $1-$3 (statistically significant) but decreases transfers to drug-abusers a small amount (insignificant) Seems to increase transfers on average 1.4 Charity ratings, overhead There are a few organisations that rate charities on the basis of their transparency, governance and overhead ratios. As we have argued these are not great metrics for the per-dollar impact of a gift. Nonetheless, we might consider Whether donors are more likely to give/give more to charities that are highly rated. This would provide evidence against the most extreme warm glow model, where donors do not care at all about how their funds are used. It’s also important to understand the workings of this ‘industry’. There are several papers providing evidence on this. Yörük, Barış K. “Charity ratings.” Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy 25.1 (2016): 195-219. We have data on charity ratings (here, from ‘Charity Navigator’) and on amounts each charity raises per year (public reporting) Does a regression of amounts raised on the rating tell us the impact of the rating? No! Better charities may get higher ratings and more donations because of their quality, not because of the rating. Response: Look at changes in ratings/donation (fixed effect modeling) But: “time-variant unobservable charity characteristics that are correlated with charitable contributions may also be correlated with the third party ratings” But note that the ‘Charity Navigator’ gives discrete ‘star ratings’ based on a continuous score Class: Any idea how this can help? “Regression discontinuity”: If we robustly control for the score, we can look at the effect of crossing a star threshold Being ‘just above’ or ‘just below’ a threshold can be seen as random But donors may react to the stars and not see the score itself; so crossing the threshold may have a large effect 2 Results: No significant overall effect (contradicts previous literature) Significant impact for small charities only: finds a nearly 20% effect of a one star increase Argument: These charities are less well-known, so people rely more on this information Other work: Brown ea (2017), Gordon ea (2009); they tend to find positive effects of good ratings, but the former is a lab experiment, and the latter doesn’t clearly identify causality (imho). 1.4.1 Financial measures in a mailing experiment (Parsons, 2007) 2 x 2 mailing appeal for People with Aids Coalition-Houston, Add “Service efforts and accomplishment info”(SEA) Add favorable “FINANCIAL” spending/overhead ratio info FINANCIAL (alone) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 180% increase in odds of donating among prior donors (\\(p&lt;0.05\\)) (Other effects mainly insignificant, underpowered) Unsure if it’s a logit or LPM – confusing writing Not effect-coded; no measure of overall impact of FINANCIAL across both SEA treatments Probably not preregistered I’d like to see CI’s Details from Parsons 1.5 Overhead and fundraising expense ratios Gneezy, Uri, Elizabeth A. Keenan, and Ayelet Gneezy. “Avoiding overhead aversion in charity.” Science 346.6209 (2014): 632-635. “We test whether designating early large gifts to cover overhead costs increases donors’ willingness to contribute to a charity” It “should not matter” People might see it as a sign of efficiency and honesty, or it might give them a greater feeling of impact From an economic perspective, designating initial large gifts as seed money or using them to cover overhead costs is the same. Charities are interested in maximizing the total funds raised and are agnostic about whether overhead costs are cov- ered by initial donations or are shared by all donors. Consumers, however, seem to have clear, strong preferences: They want their donations to be put to “good” use—in other words, for di- rect program costs.} Lab experiment: two charities: (i) Kids Korps USA, and (ii) charity: water; each participant could choose which got $100 if their decision was randomly chosen They varied how much of the $100 went to the charity, and whether this ‘overhead’ was covered by a third party DR: I don’t agree that their lab experiment represents the sort of ‘overhead aversion’ we care about. Field experiment, education charity, request letter to 40,000 US households, wants to fund as many $20k projects as possible (in USA). Asked to give $ 20/50/100 Treatments: SEED: “A private donor who believes in the importance of the project has given this campaign seed money in the amount of $10,000.” MATCH: \"… The matching grant will match every dollar given by donors like you with a dollar, up to a total of $20,000 OVERHEAD: \" … $10,000 to cover all the overhead costs associated with raising the needed donations…\" Results Share donating: Overhead (8.5%) \\(&gt;\\) *** Seed \\(\\geq\\) Match \\(&gt;\\) Control (3.4%) Amount raised: Overhead ($2.31) &gt; *** Seed, Match &gt; *** Control ($0.80) (Extensive margin: Seed \\(&gt;\\)*** Control) These results have been replicated in other trials [ref]. 1.6 Impact on (outputs and) outcomes per dollar; responses to scientific analytical information 1.6.1 The puzzle There is a puzzle: inefficient giving/little to highest-impact causes “Why don’t we give more to the most effective charities and to those most in need?”, and “Why are we not more efficient with our giving choices?” Ben Grodeck: … although people have their pet charity causes (e.g. blindness), even if you buy an argument of incommensurability between causes (which we shouldn’t imo), there are more effective charities within these subsets. From a recent grant application … When confronted with a “girl drowning in a pond” most people are willing to sacrifice substantial wealth to save her life. However, most peopledon’*tmake large donations to the very poor, in spite of evidence suggesting that lives can be saved for less than $10,000. There is a strong case that most donations go to charities that improve well-being far less per-dollar than others. Even within the same category, more can be achieved for less: e.g., while it costs about$40,000 to provide a blind person a guide dog, each $100 given for mass-distribution of ivermectin may prevent* 10-50 years of river-blindness. This raises two related questions: 1. “Why don’t we give more to the most effective charities and to those most in need?”, and 2. “Why are we not more efficient with our giving choices?” To address this, we must understand what drives giving choices, and how people react to the presentation of charity-effectiveness information. (NOTE: Singer, Peter. “The Singer solution to world poverty.” The New York Times Magazine 5.September (1999): 60-63.) While social science, biology and philosophy suggest a range of explanations for ineffective giving– invoking values, preferences, and biases–the discussion and evidence is scattered. There have been no systematic reviews or large projects targeting this, and limited communication across disciplines. Loewenstein and Small (2007) offer a theoretical framework, focusing on the interplay between the mental processes of “deliberation” and “sympathy”. Other (largely unpublished or non-academic) merely “lists” the evidence, typically citing a single paper for each potential channel, without evaluation.3 1.6.2 What are these ’ barriers’ to effective giving? If people are motivated by ‘the extent that they can help others, and reason in a maximizing way’, the above is a puzzle. What ‘barriers’ and ‘biases’ might explain it? Some of the following mechanisms may drive giving behavior\" in ways that depart from “maximizing one’s impact” (for a given contribution), and might deter giving to the most effective causes. These may lead some causes to be ‘neglected’, i.e., underfunded. If we imagine a diminishing marginal impact of giving to each cause or recipient, the causes that are neglected, receiving less support, will be left with a greater marginal impact per dollar. Barriers: a workable categorization No moral-utilitarian concerns: people may simply not be ‘moral utilitarians’; they may give for other reasons (e.g., reputation; although this kicks the problem up a level; why should one’s reputation and standing be tied to charitable giving… and shouldn’t the effectiveness of such giving matter to this?) Psychological distance,’ (lack of) awareness and consideration psychological distance/emotional arousal: Whether a cause/charity is something people are aware of, feel is important/salient, and feel close to. Key examples: Spatial/Physical distance, cultural distance; parochial altruism and ingroup bias may lead some causes to be neglected. Temporal (future problems and people) may not be as salient as current problems Other sorts of distance: Lower-probability events, Emotional/Affective distance (Small), experiential Consistent problems aren’t as noticeable (reflected in media also) availability heuristic Identity and self-perception: Things that run against one’s self-perception and how one believes others will will see you. Figure 1.1: 2. Identity &amp; self-perception; 3. Inertia and systemic factors; 4. Quantitative biases Avoiding cognitive dissonance; people don’t want to admit that their previous choices were sub-optimal ‘The volunteer experience unlocks emotion and giving’; but to local causes only? Social perceptions and signaling empathy vs effectiveness; Related: difficulty of coordinated signaling with a hard-to-coordinate measure such as ‘effectiveness’ Quantitative biases: Problems dealing with numbers and making logical evaluations involving numbers, values and amounts. Common cognitive errors or intuitive and emotional reactions triggered in these contexts. These may lead people to not reason well and make less efficient charitable choices. Some of these biases may particularly affect the more effective and neglected charities. Altruistic opportunity cost neglect Statistical/identifiable victim effect Availability heuristic (in probabilities?) Misunderstanding need (and misunderstanding marginality/tractability/sunk costs?) Proportional dominance effect/drop in bucket/psychosocial numbing/psychophysical numbing Scope insensitivity/embedding effect/part-whole effec Overhead aversion Inertia and systemic/institutional factors: Factors limiting individual and social change in behavior Social norms and difficult-to-ignore requests to donate to local charities Aversion to DOING evaluations: Things that make people reluctant to evaluate and consider the effectiveness of charities, and ways that doing these evaluations reduce generosity. “Taboo Trade-Offs (c.f., Protected Values)” Market &amp; Social Norms may clash -Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) aversion/disinterest (or simply finding it less appropriate/normal/virtuous in the charity context) Cost effectiveness information may turn off System-1 and reduce giving; statistics diminish impact of ‘identifiable victim’ I.e., the evaluation process itself may switch off empathy; see ‘dual system’ models of fast/slow thinking NOTE: I mainly focus on this latter channel below ### Defining ‘per dollar impact’ of a donation {#def-impact} (Total or marginal) impact per dollar = output per dollar \\(\\times\\) impact per output Impact of a donation: \\(B&#39;(G_i)\\) for the marginal donor GiveWell, ImpactMatters, and others attempt to measure this We know: \\(B&#39;(G_i)\\) is much larger for the most impactful relative to the most popular charities. (See Steinberg &amp; Morris 2010, for a discussion of marginal vs average effectiveness in this context.) 1.7 How do donations respond to (analytical) effectiveness and impact information? The evidence. 1.7.1 Evidence brief: key findings Small, Lowenstein, Slovic, ’07 (Lab char’l giving), prime analytic (vs emotion): NEGATIVE Study 3: Identifiable victim \\(&gt;\\) donation stats, Study : Priming analytic (maths) vs. priming feelings (‘impressions’) \\(\\rightarrow\\) less giving to identifiable victims Karlan &amp; Wood, ’17, field mailing, scientific impact info: NULL, tight-ish bounds; (+/- for ‘prior large/small donors’ Karlan &amp; W bounds, table 2: column 1 incidence near-0, se under 1%, baseline incidence 14% Amount donated +2.35, se 1.98, mean 14.17; windsorised -0.074, se 0.82, mean 11.30 Parson, ’07, field mailing, numeric overhead info: POSITIVE effect for previous donor subset (but not really ‘impact’ information) Mixed/null/positive evidence of ‘real-world ratings’ (Yoruk ’16; Brown ea ’17; Gordon ’ea ’19) Mixed evidence (lab; charity/non) of ‘excuse-driven information seeking’ (Exley ’16b; Fong &amp; O, ’10; Metzger &amp; G ’19) Bergh and Reinstein 2019 (SPPS): Analytical efficiency information has a fairly effect overall (somewhat underpowered); emotional information has a stronger effect, and it can drive people to choose the more efficient charity Reinstein et al, further experiments: ‘per-dollar-impact’ (unrealistically high) seems to drive an increased contribution rate See also: Sandra Goff; Cohn et al ’14; Dalk and Schzech ’13 1.7.2 Identifiable victims effect/ deservingness vs deliberation; initial evidence that giving is emotional only? Claim: Better to portray an individual (child) than convey the total affected Small &amp; Loewenstein (03); Small et al (07); Kogut &amp; R (05) Driven by System-1 empathy, switched off by analytic thinking Small, Lowenstein, Slovic (2007): [Study 3] “individuals who faced an identifiable victim donated more…” “…than those who faced victim statistics, p &lt; .01,” …“than those who faced [both] an identifiable victim [and] statistics, p &lt; .05.”\" Small et al, ’07, Study 4 Priming analytic thinking reduced donations to an identifiable victim relative to a feeling-based thinking prime. Yet, the primes had no distinct effect on donations to statistical victims, which is symptomatic of the difficulty in generating feelings for these victims. Tightly bounded null, but … nonlinearity? the latter non-effect appears tightly bounded; but this could simply be driven by nonlinearity. If people gave little to statistical victims, there is less room for this to decrease further. A classic problem when considering interactions. DR comment: The ‘identifiable victim effect’ appears strong and has been replicated. However, the Small et al papers is at best weak evidence on the impact of providing analytical information on giving. Verkaik (2016) notes: While previous studies have convincingly shown that providing output information, informing donors of how their donation is used, increases generosity (Cryder &amp; L, ’10; Cryder ea ’13; Aknin ea ’13) 4 …the evidence on the effects of impact information are more mixed, with mainly null effects (Metzger &amp; G ’15; Karlan &amp; W, ’14; Baron &amp; S, ’10; Caviola ea ’14, Berman ea ’15) 1.7.3 Ratings and information in general: mixed evidence (recapping) Above (see Charity ratings, overhead) we have already discussed the (mixed) evidence suggesting that People seem to respond somewhat to general charity ratings as well as to specific positive financial information presented in charity appeals People are averse to what is referred to as ‘overhead’ People may react to evidence about the perceived ‘deservingness’ of recipients However, none of these are reliable measures of the per-dollar impact on outcomes defined above. 1.7.4 “Effectiveness” info So, how do donations respond to (analytical) effectiveness and impact information? One of the strongest pieces of evidence is provided by: Karlan and Wood (2017) Add scientific impact text to appeal (&amp; remove emotional text): \\(\\rightarrow\\) little net effect \\(\\rightarrow\\) reduced (increased) giving among small (large) prior donors (not a preregistered hypothesis) Potential confounds, specificity Some skeptical notes: Yale/institution effect (seemed negative) Nature of ‘impact’ information (not exactly quantitative) ex-post splitting two things changed at once (impact in, emotional out) Details of Karlan first wave: SCIENCE vs EMOTION According to studies on our programs in Peru that used rigorous scientific methodologies, women who have received both loans and business education saw their profits grow, even when compared to women who just received loans for their businesses. But the real difference comes when times are slow. The study showed that women in Freedom from Hunger’s Credit with Education program kept their profits strong–ensuring that their families would not suffer, but thrive. Because of caring people like you, Freedom from Hunger was able to offer Sebastiana a self-help path toward achieving her dream of getting “a little land to farm” and pass down to her children. As Sebastiana’s young son, Aurelio, runs up to hug her, she says, “I do whatever I can for my children.” 1.8 Information as an ‘excuse’ not to give; allows motivated reasoning Do people selectively seek information on charities to avoid giving? Do they interpret such evidence with ‘motivated reasoning’ in order to feel good about not donating? Exley, 2016b: Greater discounting of ‘less-efficient’ charity in charity-charity decision-making than in charity-self decision-making. Fong &amp; O, ’10: “Dictators [charitable giving] who acquire information mostly use it to withhold resources from less-preferred types, leading to a drastic decline in aggregate transfers” But… Exley issues: Experimenter demand (M-turk focus), not really ‘impact’ information Fong: Selection effects. In their tables, exogenous provision of information seems to increase donations overall. Also … it’s evidence on the deservingness of the recipients, not on impact of a charity itself. Metzger &amp; Gunther, ’19 Lab donations to high/low-performing NGO More purchasing of ‘recipient type’ than ‘impact’ info Mixed &amp; weak evidence on excuse-driven information-seeking Caveats… Opportunity to buy info on ‘recipient type’ increased giving, on ‘admin costs’ decreased giving (marginal significance for both), no effect of ‘aid impact’ but wide CI ‘Free info’ on each of these had insignificant effects (underpowered!) Lots of caveats; e.g., recipient type (artists vs children) may have been seen as a proxy for impact 1.9 Reinstein ‘Our empirical approach’ Naturalistic environments Robustness across setups/frames Honest presentation of evidence, allowing integration The general project is a practical one (although Bergh’s project aims to explore into specific mechanisms). By measuring the impact of several types of efficiency information, across several contexts, we aim to produce a fairly robust picture. We expect heterogeneity and sensitivity to frames; thus results may vary, and we will carefully examine the overall picture as well as this variation in a ‘mini-meta-analysis’. To limit various types of experimenter demand and arbitrary coherence, these experiments are between participant, and (largely) run in contexts where the donation is not the focus of the interaction. We have preregistered our studies, hypotheses and analyses. We will share all of our data to enable future reanalyses. Todo: How should we interpret these estimates?↩ This is for small charities↩ See: Loewenstein and Small 2007); (Berman et al. 2018) (introduction). (Baron and Szymanska, 2011). Unpublished or non-academic: ‘Ideas42, 2016; Gertler, 2015; Yoeli↩ Robin: I personally wouldn’t count the Cryder studies as examples of studies demonstrating that effectiveness has a positive effect on giving. There’s a fundamental difference between psychological perceptions of impact (and “tweaks” of info to make it seem more impactful to donate) versus evaluating actual evidence of effectiveness. For instance, the fact that donors are more willing to donate when a fundraiser is close to reaching a goal tells us something about how people feel about donating, but it tells us absolutely nothing about the actual effectiveness of a charity and how people process such information. Effectiveness is an attribute of the charity, not a perception of making a difference (if we reduce effectiveness to a subjective impact belief then guide dogs could also argued to be highly effective). DR: True; But I wouldn’t say it is completely unrelated. For actual cost-effectiveness/impact information to be used to increase/improve giving we presumably need both 1. Individuals care about their own impact per $, as they perceive it (Cryder speaks to this),2. Individuals can reasonably draw conclusions about effectiveness per $ from the information properly presented, and 3. The presentation of this information does not itself substantially reduce the actualized motivation to give↩ "],

We are running this subject to the final say of the charity. We have proposed that the Treatment emails (but not the control emails) will include a sentence/fragment such as the following in both a captioned photo in the email, and the email text: “Last year, we were able to provide [general provision of an outcome here relevant to the charity] to a [recipient unit] with just $[small amount of money].” (from prereg) We plan to perform standard nonparametric statistical tests of the effect of this treatment on Average gift amount (including zeroes) Incidence/number of people making a gift, [and] Incidence of gifts of exactly $10. In particular, we will focus on Fisher’s exact test (for incidence) and the standard rank sum and t-tests for the donation amounts. Power calculations Response rates in previous such emails were extremely low: approximately 1 per 3,000 emails. Our power calculations suggest that we have .29 power to detect a 50% effect, and 0.90 power to detect approximately a 100% (doubling) on incidence… Because of this limited power, we will ask the charity to run this trial a second time with an equivalent-sized sample.
