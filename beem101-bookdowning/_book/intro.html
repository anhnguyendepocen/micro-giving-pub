<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> This module</h2>
<p><strong>BEEM101: Microeconomics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lectures</p></li>
<li><p>Problem sets: There are eight problem sets, each covering a specific block of material. <em>The material in these problem sets either comes from exams or builds exam skills.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Representative answers for each problem set will be given a few days after each problem set is released, or shortly before the relevant support class.</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes (AKA ‘tutorials’ AKA ‘seminars’) every fortnight (5 total)</li>
</ul>
<p>Support classes will largely focus on covering (exploring, solving, discussing) the problem sets. However, there will obviously not be time to cover every question in the tutorial. Note there are only 5 tutorials but 8 problem sets; thus, tutorials may cover problems from multiple recent problem sets.</p>
<p>These classes are about <em>applying</em> material you have learned, not lecturing on it or learning it for the first time.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>Come ready to ask questions and participate:</em></p>
<p>we aim to make these highly interactive and participatory. To really be helpful, we need to know what areas you might be struggling with and where your logic might be breaking down; thus we will either do cold calling or highly encourage all the students in these tutorials to ask and answer questions. Think of these as (especially) ‘safe spaces’; you will be judged or marked based on your performance in the support classes, and there are no dumb questions. If you have a question many of your peers probably have the same question, so asking it provides a <em>public good</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Marks</p>
<ul>
<li>Midterm, 90 minutes 35 marks</li>
<li>Final examination: 65 marks</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Classes every fortnight</p></li>
<li><p>Plus research discussion sessions in alternate weeks, if you are interested</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="texts" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Texts and resources</h3>
<p>In previous years I recommended Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50… older editions are fine too). However, you may find this to be too basic a level, as it’s meant for undergraduates. Have a look.</p>
<p>I am now using and recommending several other free online resources instead (or in addition).</p>
<p>Note that this is a ‘standard core’: any intermediate or advanced textbook in Microeconomics will cover most of the same material.</p>
<p>A focal resource:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/dale/ieav21.pdf">Introduction to
Economic Analysis - MacAffee, Lewis, Dale</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A ‘no-fluff’ text from an esteemed source. Covers much of this module, but the level varies somewhat throughout. Includes calculus and lots of parametric examples. Lots of great content. Lots of solved problems.</p>
<p>I will also heavily draw on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.smallparty.org/yoram/quantum/#downloads">Quantum Microeconomics</a>; consider the version either with or without calculus</p>
<ul>
<li>An unconventional but very careful and interesting approach; my impression is that it is well organised and explained. You may like it!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here)[<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/" class="uri">https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/</a>] this will give you a flavor of the PhD level micro</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://laecon1.lyryx.com/textbooks/OPEN_CURTIS_MIC_1/marketing/CurtisIrvine-Microeconomics-2017A.pdf">Microeconomics
Markets, Methods &amp; Models
an Open Text
by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine</a></p>
<ul>
<li>A full-fledged text covering many of the topics of this module, without calculus</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="http://my.ilstu.edu/~mswalber/ECO240/index.html">Intermediate microeconomics - M Walbert Illinois tutorials</a> - click ‘tutorials’</p>
<ul>
<li>A series of tutorials for an intermediate microeconomics module. Covers many of the topics of this module. No calculus but a lot of algebra. Lots of supplementary materials too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://cnx.org/contents/bc498e1f-efe9-43a0-8dea-d3569ad09a82">Principles of Economics 2e, Openstax</a> - very well organised, but not quite ‘intermediate’, not enough maths for my taste, but may be very helpful as revision and as an additional source of explanations!</p></li>

<hr />
<p><font color='red'>Note:</font> The module moves through select parts of textbook; coverage and order given in handout.</p>
<p>Lectures <span class="math inline">\(\neq\)</span> everything!: <em>Some</em> of the text is only <em>mentioned</em> in lecture/handout, but you still must read &amp; learn it. On the other hand some sections of the text are skipped. Some material is covered in these handouts, or recommended readings, that is <em>not</em> in the text; this is clearly emphasized. All of this is laid out in this handout.</p>

<div id="my-feedback" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Feedback on your highly-esteemed but extremely humble lecturer</h2>
<p>We will have two ‘official’ feedback points. There will be an ‘early feedback’ survey, perhaps around week 4 or 5. This gives you a chance to give me constructive suggestions that I can adapt to <em>during</em> the rest of the module.</p>

<div id="economic-basics-weeks-1-2" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> 1. Economic basics (weeks 1-2)</h3>

<p>In weeks one and two we will go over some of the simple tools in the economists’ kit. I will try to explain to you what we mean by ‘economic models’ and give you some examples of these which may be familiar to you. I will not go over the math tools in the lecture; you should study/revise this on your own. We <em>will</em> go over many of these again briefly as we apply these math tools to our economic models throughout the module.</p>
<p>We will also start thinking about, and formalising individual decisions—over nearly all spheres of life— in a way you may not have seen before, which may even strike you as weirdly hyper-rational.</p>
<p>Essentially, this (sometimes confusingly called ‘normative decision theory’) is the way economists typically conceive of and model people’s choices. Even though it seems to require precise optimization, perhaps to a strange extent, there are various reasonable justifications for this, and you might also see it as a benchmark… ‘Let’s understand what optimization would look like, as a starting point’.</p>
<p>This framework is actually fairly general; it can allow all sorts of preferences (e.g., embodying ‘risk aversion’ and ‘altruism’) and wide-ranging choices. However it <em>does</em> imply certain ‘restrictions’: it rules out some sort of behavior that is perhaps obviously illogical.</p>
<p>We will discuss how ‘preferences’ may define the ‘utility functions’. The ‘uility function’ is the thing that make choices in order to maximize. In the classical framework, people make choices in order to maximise the value of their utility function. Utility functions can also be expressed in terms of ‘indifference curves’ (but keep the distinction in mind; the indifference curves are not themselves the utility functions).</p>
<p>Under this framework individuals make the ‘optimal choices’ … by making the choices that yield the maximum value of the utility functions given their constraints … in particular they have a ‘budget constraint’ that says they cannot spend more than they earn. You will learn how to derive these budget constraints and plot these on a graph, along with the indifference curves, and to interpret these diagrams.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.2</span> 2. Building the model, putting it together, examining it (weeks 3-5)</h3>
<p>‘What determines the price and quantities exchanged in an unregulated (or ’free’) market?’ ‘Do markets yield good outcomes?’</p>
<p>These questions have been at the backbone of Economics for millennia, at least since Aristotle.</p>
<p>Classical economists such as Adam Smith built-up ideas of how seemingly random and disorganized markets can yield predictable and efficient outcomes, at least under appropriate conditions.
Neoclassical and modern economists (such as Alfred Marshall, David Ricardo, Leon Walras, and Paul Samuelson) have formalized these, building models involving of systems of demand and supply and general equilibrium, and have made the case for the efficiency and desirability of the free market outcomes, at least under specified conditions.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In the second (and largest) chunk of the course, we will learn some of the essential building blocks of this model, and how they are justified and put together to yield predictions for market outcomes and ‘welfare’. In the process, we will get useful ideas and intuitions about the working of markets.</p>

<p>We will learn how individual optimization implies a relationship between the price of a good (and the consumer’s income) and the amount a consumer chooses to purchase of that good; her individual <em>demand curve</em>.</p>
<p>Adding up these individual demand curves yields the <em>market demand curve</em>, which describes the way the <em>total</em> amount of a good consumers wish to purchase depends on the market price of that good.</p>

<p>Someone has to make this stuff, you know! We consider ‘production functions’ that map how inputs can be turned into outputs. If firms are seeking to maximize profits, then whatever output they want to produce … they will try to produce it using the combination of inputs (Capital, labor, etc.) that can do this at the lowest cost. If we know production functions and input costs, we can describe a firm’s cost of producing every amount of a particular good.</p>

<p>Economists typically assume that firms make choices to maximize profits. (Mathematically, this ‘optimisation’, i.e., maximisation, has some things in common with the consumer optimisation of utility, so it may look familiar).</p>
<p>Knowing their cost of production and the demand curve they will face, firms will thus choose to produce the <em>amount</em> that yields them the highest profit; we will explain the conditions for this.</p>
<p>With ‘free entry/exit of firms’ we have the (ideal) situation of <em>perfect competition</em>.</p>

<p>Each firm’s supply curve is added up to generate the market supply curve; we consider this in both the ‘short and long run’.
We define the concepts of ‘consumer surplus’ and ‘producer surplus’; adding these yields the total value in an economy or the total ‘social welfare’.</p>
<p>We will briefly and roughly consider the idea of an <em>equilibrium</em> in all markets; prices such that quantity demanded equals quantity supplied for all outputs and inputs.
We will get some sense of the idea of what general ‘economic efficiency’ means.</p>
<p>I will state and give you some intuition behind the ‘first and second welfare theorems’; the conditions under which free markets yield ‘good outcomes’, defined in a particular sense.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="how-the-market-can-go-wrong-and-how-to-maybe-fix-it-weeks-6-7" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.3</span> 3. How the market can go wrong (and how to maybe fix it) (weeks 6-7)</h3>
<p>Notice I kept saying “under certain conditions” free markets yield good outcomes. These conditions may not hold, for various reasons. In the third chunk, we discuss two of these reasons, which lead to ‘market failures’. It is important to understand these. These (sometimes) offer a justification for government intervention, and help us understand how government can best respond. These also offer insights for business models; which ‘goods’ may be hard to provide without government subsidies, and how can we use technological innovation to capture value and reduce the extent of market failures? (Businesses may also be able to take advantage of market failures in ways that are harmful to public welfare, But I would hate to think I’m training you to do this.)</p>

<p>Not all goods can easily be restricted to a single consumer. ‘Non-rival’ and ‘non-excludable’ goods (e.g., a fireworks display) are called <em>public goods</em>: these will tend to be undersupplied by the free market, as we will come to understand. We will also discuss the evidence for the private provision of these, and consider government’s ability to provide them.</p>

<p>This is the polar opposite market structure to perfect competition; a monopoly is a single firm that exclusively dominated a particular industry. It will tend to produce less and charge more than would be socially optimal, yielding a ‘deadweight loss’ (aka ‘DWL’).</p>
<p>‘Price discrimination’ is (more or less) when a firm charges different prices to different consumers; this can reduce (or increase) the ‘deadweight loss’ of monopoly, as we will learn.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.4</span> 4. Extensions to the model and applications (weeks 8-10)</h3>
<p>In the final chunk we extend the model to accommodate some important aspects of the real world. We investigate the implication of these for market outcomes.</p>

<p>We make many decisions without knowing exactly what the consequence of each choice will be. Economists typically model this using the “expected utility” framework. A warning: students often get this concept wrong, so be careful. Expected utility is not the same as ‘expected monetary value’; and this allows EU to embody risk aversion.</p>

<p>For many decisions we make the consequences depend on what <em>others</em> do; we have ‘strategic interaction’. Economist usually consider this using the framework and tools of <em>game theory</em>.</p>

<p>People may not actually make decisions In the hyper-rational way we have been assuming. Here we carefully consider the adaptation of some insights from Psychology to Economics, yielding ‘behavioral economics’</p>

<p>I’ve had many discussions about these things with my non-economist wife. Some of them make her more sanguine and content; other stress her out.</p>

<p></p>
<p>We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a ‘single representative consumer’. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to applying these things to the real world, or testing these models, be careful; people may differ and they may change and they may have multiple motives.</p>

<p><strong>Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> opportunities.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse.</p>
<p>I’m not telling you what <em>you</em> need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics.</p>
<p>As I also mentioned, these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks.</p>
<p>Here are some possible examples.<br />
</p>
<p><em>Imperfection:</em> Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> ‘All you can eat’ <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <font color='blue'>Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited</font><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><font color='gray'>When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for ‘all-you-can-eat’ And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later.</font></p>
<p>Free-riding on public goods<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <font color='ForestGreen'>Disneyworld, resorts</font><br />
</p>
<p><br />
<font color='gray'>We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride. They then charge an admission fee to ‘be inside of Disney World’ and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods.</font></p>
<p>Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <font color='ForestGreen'>Uber, AirBnb</font><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves).</p>
<hr />
<p>Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <font color='ForestGreen'>Tinder</font></p>
<p>Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high.</p>
<p>A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit.</p>
<p><font color='gray'>If you’re interested, see my research on this</font> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx4yfun1ctxuezw/LosingFace.pdf?dl=0">here</a>, presentation slides <a href="http://wp.me/aZhn3-c8">here</a>, my research page is <a href="https://wordpress.com/page/davidreinstein.wordpress.com/18">here</a>.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Asymmetric information, adverse selection<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <font color='ForestGreen'>NHS, ‘Obamacare’</font></p>
<p>This one <em>is</em> a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA.</p>
<p>Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later).</p>
<p>There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance ( or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you ‘outsource’ and when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do?</p>

Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop’s fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of ‘Ceteris paribus’ (all other things being equal) can help us here.</p>

<p>What do models give us?</p>
<p><em><font color='OliveGreen'>There are different views of this</font></em></p>
<p>Via logic and mathematics:</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> Results</strong><br />
</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>and sometimes these also yield testable predictions (if the assumptions hold)</p>
<p><br> </p>

<p><img src="picsfigs/PPF_text.png" width="80%" height="3in" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Above, we see a depiction of the “production possibility frontier” (PPF), explained in the figure’s caption. You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced.</p>
<p><font color='gray'>I’m not sure if I would call it a ‘model’, but it certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions. This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now.</font></p>
<p>Note: <font color='RawSienna'>For comprehension: <em>Draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means</em>. <em>See fig 1.1</em> <em>Advanced: Consider … what assumptions does the PPF (implicitly) make?</em></font></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PPF illustrates key principles</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Principle 1: Scarce Resources</p>
<p>Principle 2: Scarcity involves opportunity cost.<br />
</p>
<p><em>Notes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it.</li>
<li>The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone ‘next best’ opportunity from a choice.</li>
<li>I may just call this ‘cost’</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Comprehension question (advanced):</em> <font color='blue'>Think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the ‘cost’ and the economists’ definition of an ‘opportunity cost’</font></p>
<p>On the PPF the opportunity cost of more clothing is less food.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Principle 3: Opportunity costs are (often) increasing.</p>
<ul>
<li>What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To produce more and more clothing you would have to give up increasing amounts of food.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The “law” of diminishing marginal returns.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I’m somewhat sceptical of this being a ‘law’; there are certainly increasing returns in certain regions.</em> However, you will see it again and again as it is a fairly standard assumption.</p>

<p>Argument: If it were trading at any other price (say 1-1), no one would hunt a deer, they would just hunt a beaver and trade it for a deer; so that can’t be the prevailing price.</p>

<hr />
<!---
The early nineteenth century was a period of considerable controversy in economics, especially in England. The two most pressing issues of the day were whether international trade was having a negative effect on the economy and whether industrial growth was harming farmland and other natural resources
It is testimony to the timelessness of economic questions that these are some of the same issues that dominate political discussions in the United States (and elsewhere) today. One of the most influential contributors to the earlier debates was the British financier and pamphleteer David Ricardo (1772–1823).
-->
<blockquote>
<p>Farmland was expanding in England … as new and less fertile land was brought into use, it would naturally take more labor … to produce an extra bushel of grain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Ricardo:</p>
<p><em>Diminishing returns:</em> the cost of producing one more unit of good A (here, food)—in terms of other goods foregone—rises as more of A is produced</p>
<ul>
<li>Explains why a supply curve might slope upwards
<ul>
<li>(produce more <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> costs more <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> higher price necessary)</li>
<li>Left unexplained: How much is produced, thus ‘what <em>is</em> the price?’</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Some key points:</em> Ricardo’s model is inconsistent with the falling prices that occurred during the 19th century. These were ‘Falling prices’ in terms of goods purchased per unit of labour (leisure foregone). However, the Marshallian cross also doesn’t explain it without a further understanding of technological change.</p>
</div>
<div id="marshalls-model-of-supply-and-demand" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.18</span> Marshall’s Model of Supply and Demand</h2>
<p>Economists and philosophers have long sought to explain ‘what determines the prices, and why do they change the way they do?’</p>
<p>In the 19th century UK prices were falling while quantities were increasing; this was a puzzle.</p>
<p>Alfred Marshall argued that a good’s price must equal <em>both</em> the cost to produce and the value (to consumers) of the last unit produced and consumed.</p>
<p>He introduced the ‘demand curve’; <em>with a downward slope</em>.</p>
<p>This slope was justified by ‘satiation’: for an individual, additional units of a good are usually valued less and less. For example, you might be willing to pay thousands of pounds to be able to access 100 gallons of water rather than no water at all, but if you already have access to a thousand gallons of water, you will not be willing to pay very much for an additional 100 gallons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, firms must cater to less and less keen consumers as they wants to sell more and more units. We come back to this later in the module.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>‘Willingness to pay’ (wtp) becomes less and less for the next unit purchased, so will buy more only at a lower price. Equivalently, at a lower price more people find the value exceeds the price, and for additional units.</p>
<p><font color='gray'>Note that we will also return to these questions in more depth in later chapters as we build up the demand and supply curves.</font></p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>With ‘single crossing’ (a fancy condition you can ignore in this module) there is a unique price where <span class="math inline">\(Q^s(p)=Q^d(p)\)</span>,
and a unique quantity where the last unit’s value to the consumer equals its cost to produce.</p>
<p><strong>Scissors analogy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The equilibrium model is analogised to a pair of scissors; neither <em>scis</em> cuts alone</li>
</ul>
<p>So <em>don’t</em> ask ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged’?</p>
<ul>
<li><font color='blue'>Understand why</font> ‘Just like neither scis cuts alone, neither the supply nor the demand curve determines the equilibrium price and quantity in isolation’?</li>
</ul>
<p><font color='RawSienna'> Consider: What does it mean to be at equilibrium, and how do we get there?</font></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Draw: the famous Marshallian cross</em> <em>Can you explain?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The inefficiency of any price other than where <span class="math inline">\(Q^D(p)=Q^S(p)\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>If the price was set at a different value, what forces might push it to the equilibrium?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>Suggested ans:</em></p>
<p>To economists, a ‘shortage’ is where, at the prevailing or imposed price, consumers are willing to buy more than is available. Some consumers get value from the good in excess of the price.<br />
</p>
<p>In such a case, firms might offer a higher price, or sellers might ask for a higher price. The price rise would reduce quantity demanded (not ‘reduce demand’)  and increase quantity supplied (not ‘reduce supply’).</p>
<p><br> </p>

<li><p>Which factors cause the supply and demand curves to shift?</p></li>
<li><p>What causes ‘movements along’ the supply or demand curve?</p></li>

However, you are not forbidden from making normative statements, and positive results are useful in making normative judgements. But we should try to be clear which type of statement we are making. Still, much economic research has both positive and normative interpretations and implications. Some economists work on ways of clearly defining and quantifying preferences over social outcomes. Others work on determining determining ‘how to optimise’, with implications for which policies and decisions (for individuals, firms, governments, and nonprofits) will be most efficient and effective at attaining particular goals.</font></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.31</span> Exogenous and endogenous variables</h2>

<li>the <em>market demand</em> curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as <span class="math inline">\(Q_D(P,...)\)</span> and</li>
<li>the <em>market supply</em> curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as <span class="math inline">\(Q_S(P,...)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quantity (units of a good) that firms in the market are willing to supply is a function of the price and other ‘background’ things. The total quantity that consumers in the market or willing to demand is a different function of the price of other things. We typically these ‘supply curve’, and ‘demand curve’, respectively, but I want to to think of these as functions that can shift. I don’t want you to write ‘demand went down’; that is ambiguous.</p>
<p>The price where these quantities are equal is the ‘prevailing price in the market’. We build this up throughout the next sections in more detail.</p>
<p>Getting back to the example…</p>
<p>Empirical work has estimated the equations below, the estimated supply and demand curves expressed in dollars and millions of <em>barrels</em>, from an earlier period:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Q_D = 85 - 0.4P \: (D) \]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ Q_S = 55 + 0.6P \: (S) \]</span></p>
<p>Setting <span class="math inline">\(Q_S=Q_D\)</span> and solving this yields: <span class="math inline">\(85 - 0.4P=55+0.6P \rightarrow P = 30, Q = 73\)</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This approximates the 2000-2002 price</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>So what accounted for price rise in 2008 to about US$130, and then fall to US$50 by March 2009?</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>China and India’s economy grew, implying a growth in the world economy by 3-4% per year</p></li>
<li><p>Various calculations imply that this represents a shifting out in the Demand curve from <span class="math inline">\(Q_D = 85 - 0.4P\)</span> to:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\]</span></p>
<p><font color='gray'>Side note:</font> I think the ‘new demand’ curve comes from an approximation: if the world economy grew at 4% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it’s previous size. … thus the growth is <span class="math inline">\(1.047^7=1.316\)</span>.
They assume oil’s demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112.
Note that the text has a typo: equation 3 on page 40, the new demand, should read <span class="math inline">\(Q=112-0.4P\)</span>.</p>
<p>With the same supply curve and the new demand curve we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[Q_S = 55 + 0.6P\]</span></p>
<p>This <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> solves to <span class="math inline">\(P=57, Q=87\)</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, overall price inflation, US$ devaluation <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> accounts for about a price of US$94</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>So why was did the price move to $130?</p>
<p>Other changes included: Speculation, other disruptions. <em>Supply</em> may have also shifted (political turmoil, new sources of energy, etc.)</p>
