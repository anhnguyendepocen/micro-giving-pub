<h2>This module</h2>
<p><strong>BEEM101: Microeconomics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lectures</p></li>
<li><p>Problem sets: There are eight problem sets, each covering a specific block of material. <em>The material in these problem sets either comes from exams or builds exam skills.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Representative answers for each problem set will be given a few days after each problem set is released, or shortly before the relevant support class.</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes (AKA ‘tutorials’ AKA ‘seminars’) every fortnight (5 total)</li>
</ul>
<p>Support classes will largely focus on covering (exploring, solving, discussing) the problem sets. However, there will obviously not be time to cover every question in the tutorial. Note there are only 5 tutorials but 8 problem sets; thus, tutorials may cover problems from multiple recent problem sets.</p>
<p>These classes are about <em>applying</em> material you have learned, not lecturing on it or learning it for the first time.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>Come ready to ask questions and participate:</em></p>
<p>I aim to make these highly interactive and participatory. To really be helpful, we need to know what areas you might be struggling with and where your logic might be breaking down; thus we will either do cold calling or highly encourage all the students in these tutorials to ask and answer questions. Think of these as (especially) ‘safe spaces’; you will be judged or marked based on your performance in the support classes, and there are no dumb questions. If you have a question many of your peers probably have the same question, so asking it provides a <em>public good</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Marks</p>
<ul>
<li>Midterm, 90 minutes 35 marks</li>
<li>Final examination, 2 hours: 65 marks</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Classes every fortnight</p></li>
<li><p>Plus research ‘coffees’ (discussion sessions) in alternate weeks, if you are interested</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="texts-and-resources--texts" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Texts and resources {-#texts}</h3>
<p>In previous years I recommended Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50… older editions are fine too). However, you may find this to be too basic a level, as it’s meant for undergraduates. Have a look.</p>
<p>I am now using and recommending several other free online resources instead (or in addition).</p>
<p>Note that this is a ‘standard core’: any intermediate or advanced textbook in microeconomics will cover most of the same material.</p>
<p>A focal resource:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/dale/ieav21.pdf">Introduction to
Economic Analysis - MacAffee, Lewis, Dale</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A ‘no-fluff’ text from an esteemed source. Covers much of this module, but the level varies somewhat throughout. Includes calculus and lots of parametric examples. Lots of great content. Lots of solved problems.</p>
<p>I will also heavily draw on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.smallparty.org/yoram/quantum/#downloads">Quantum Microeconomics</a>; consider the version either with or without calculus</p>
<ul>
<li>An unconventional but very careful and interesting approach; my impression is that it is well organised and explained. You may like it!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/">all the files for this course can be downloaded here</a> this will give you a flavor of nearly-PhD-level micro</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://laecon1.lyryx.com/textbooks/OPEN_CURTIS_MIC_1/marketing/CurtisIrvine-Microeconomics-2017A.pdf">Microeconomics
Markets, Methods &amp; Models
an Open Text
by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine</a></p>
<ul>
<li>A full-fledged text covering many of the topics of this module, without calculus</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="http://my.ilstu.edu/~mswalber/ECO240/index.html">Intermediate microeconomics - M Walbert Illinois tutorials</a> - click ‘tutorials’</p>
<ul>
<li>A series of tutorials for an intermediate microeconomics module. Covers many of the topics of this module. No calculus but a lot of algebra. Lots of supplementary materials too.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br> </p>
<hr />
<p><font color='red'>Note:</font> The module moves through select parts of textbooks; coverage and order given in handout.</p>
<p>Lectures <span class="math inline">\(\neq\)</span> everything!: <em>Some</em> of the text is only <em>mentioned</em> in lecture/handout, but you still must read &amp; learn it. On the other hand some sections of each text are skipped. Some material is covered in these handouts, or recommended readings, that is <em>not</em> in the text; this is clearly emphasized. All of this is laid out in this handout.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="my-feedback" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Feedback on your highly-esteemed but extremely humble lecturer</h2>
<p>We will have two ‘official’ feedback points. There will be an ‘early feedback’ survey, perhaps around week 4 or 5. This gives you a chance to give me constructive suggestions that I can adapt to <em>during</em> the rest of the module.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>For the Accelerate end-of-module feedback, you will be asked to rate me.
<em>All</em> of these questions are seen as an evaluation of <em>my performance</em> specifically by the <a href="https://twitter.com/ass_deans?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">“associate dean”</a>.</p>
<p>You will be asked to express an opinion, from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’, on one or more questions about the quality of this module.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> You may have seen many of these concepts before.</p>
<p>But do you really understand them well enough to <em>explain</em> them to a non-economist and to <em>apply</em> them to a new real-world situation?</p>
<p>And do you understand the <em>limits and critiques</em> of these, and how economists try to <em>measure and test</em> them?</p>
<p><font color='gray'>Asessment hint: I try to ask you questions that you would not know the answer to had you not taken this module. What would be the purpose of you simply learning ‘common sense’ or ‘conventional wisdom’ … that you already knew? If you are answering an open response/essay question by simply stating something that the average Joe sitting on a pub bench would have said, you may want to rethink the way you are answering this question.

<div id="economic-basics-weeks-1-2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>1. Economic basics (weeks 1-2)</h3>

<p>In weeks one and two we will go over some of the simple tools in the economists’ kit. I will try to explain to you what we mean by ‘economic models’ and give you some examples of these which may be familiar to you.</p>
<p>We will also start thinking about, and formalising individual decisions—over nearly all spheres of life— in a way you may not have seen before, which may even strike you as weirdly hyper-rational.</p>
<p>Essentially, this (sometimes confusingly called ‘normative decision theory’) is the way economists typically conceive of and model people’s choices. Even though it seems to require precise optimization, perhaps to a strange extent, there are various reasonable justifications for this, and you might also see it as a benchmark… ‘Let’s understand what optimization would look like, as a starting point’.</p>
<p>This framework is actually fairly general; it can allow all sorts of preferences (e.g., embodying ‘risk aversion’ and ‘altruism’) and wide-ranging choices. However it <em>does</em> imply certain ‘restrictions’: it rules out some sort of behavior that is perhaps obviously illogical.</p>
<p>We will discuss how ‘preferences’ may define the ‘utility functions’. The ‘uility function’ is the thing that make choices in order to maximize. In the classical framework, people make choices in order to maximise the value of their utility function. Utility functions can also be expressed in terms of ‘indifference curves’ (but keep the distinction in mind; the indifference curves are not themselves the utility functions).</p>
<p>Under this framework individuals make the ‘optimal choices’ … by making the choices that yield the maximum value of the utility functions given their constraints … in particular they have a ‘budget constraint’ that says they cannot spend more than they earn. You will learn how to derive these budget constraints and plot these on a graph, along with the indifference curves, and to interpret these diagrams.</p>
<p><em>I will also introduce ‘data’ and some key concepts from ‘Empirical analysis’ and ‘Econometrics’ here</em></p>

<div id="building-the-model-putting-it-together-examining-it-weeks-3-5-approx" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>2. Building the model, putting it together, examining it (weeks 3-5 approx)</h3>
<p>‘What determines the price and quantities exchanged in an unregulated (or ’free’) market?’ ‘Do markets yield good outcomes?’</p>
<p>These questions have been at the backbone of Economics for millennia, at least since Aristotle.</p>
<p>Classical economists such as Adam Smith built-up ideas of how seemingly random and disorganized markets can yield predictable and efficient outcomes, at least under appropriate conditions.
Neoclassical and modern economists (such as Alfred Marshall, David Ricardo, Leon Walras, and Paul Samuelson) have formalized these, building models involving of systems of demand and supply and general equilibrium, and have made the case for the efficiency and desirability of the free market outcomes, at least under specified conditions.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In the second (and largest) chunk of the course, we will learn some of the essential building blocks of this model, and how they are justified and put together to yield predictions for market outcomes and ‘welfare’. In the process, we will get useful ideas and intuitions about the working of markets.</p>

<p>We will learn how individual optimization implies a relationship between the price of a good (and the consumer’s income) and the amount a consumer chooses to purchase of that good; her individual <em>demand curve</em>.</p>
<p>Adding up these individual demand curves yields the <em>market demand curve</em>, which describes the way the <em>total</em> amount of a good consumers wish to purchase depends on the market price of that good.</p>

<p>Someone has to make this stuff, you know! We consider ‘production functions’ that map how inputs can be turned into outputs. If firms are seeking to maximize profits, then whatever output they want to produce … they will try to produce it using the combination of inputs (Capital, labor, etc.) that can do this at the lowest cost. If we know production functions and input costs, we can describe a firm’s cost of producing every amount of a particular good.</p>

<p>Economists typically assume that firms make choices to maximize profits. (Mathematically, this ‘optimisation’, i.e., maximisation, has some things in common with the consumer optimisation of utility, so it may look familiar).</p>
<p>Knowing their cost of production and the demand curve they will face, firms will thus choose to produce the <em>amount</em> that yields them the highest profit; we will explain the conditions for this.</p>
<p>With ‘free entry/exit of firms’ we have the (ideal) situation of <em>perfect competition</em>.</p>

<p>Each firm’s supply curve is added up to generate the market supply curve; we consider this in both the ‘short and long run’.
We define the concepts of ‘consumer surplus’ and ‘producer surplus’; adding these yields the total value in an economy or the total ‘social welfare’.</p>
<p>We will briefly and roughly consider the idea of an <em>equilibrium</em> in all markets; prices such that quantity demanded equals quantity supplied for all outputs and inputs.
We will get some sense of the idea of what general ‘economic efficiency’ means.</p>
<p>I will state and give you some intuition behind the ‘first and second welfare theorems’; the conditions under which free markets yield ‘good outcomes’, defined in a particular sense.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="how-the-market-can-go-wrong-and-how-to-maybe-fix-it-weeks-6-7-approx" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>3. How the market can go wrong (and how to maybe fix it) (weeks 6-7 approx)</h3>
<p>Notice I kept saying “under certain conditions” free markets yield good outcomes. These conditions may not hold, for various reasons. In the third chunk, we discuss two of these reasons, which lead to ‘market failures’. It is important to understand these. These (sometimes) offer a justification for government intervention, and help us understand how government can best respond. These also offer insights for business models; which ‘goods’ may be hard to provide without government subsidies, and how can we use technological innovation to capture value and reduce the extent of market failures? (Businesses may also be able to take advantage of market failures in ways that are harmful to public welfare, But I would hate to think I’m training you to do this.)</p>

<p>Not all goods can easily be restricted to a single consumer. ‘Non-rival’ and ‘non-excludable’ goods (e.g., a fireworks display) are called <em>public goods</em>: these will tend to be undersupplied by the free market, as we will come to understand. We will also discuss the evidence for the private provision of these, and consider government’s ability to provide them.</p>

<p>This is the polar opposite market structure to perfect competition; a monopoly is a single firm that exclusively dominated a particular industry. It will tend to produce less and charge more than would be socially optimal, yielding a ‘deadweight loss’ (aka ‘DWL’).</p>
<p>‘Price discrimination’ is (more or less) when a firm charges different prices to different consumers; this can reduce (or increase) the ‘deadweight loss’ of monopoly, as we will learn.</p>
</div>
<div id="extensions-to-the-model-and-applications-weeks-8-11" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>4. Extensions to the model and applications (weeks 8-11)</h3>
<p>In the final chunk we extend the model to accommodate some important aspects of the real world. We investigate the implication of these for market outcomes.</p>

<p>We make many decisions without knowing exactly what the consequence of each choice will be. Economists typically model this using the “expected utility” framework. A warning: students often get this concept wrong, so be careful. Expected utility is not the same as ‘expected monetary value’; and this allows EU to embody risk aversion.</p>

<p>For many decisions we make the consequences depend on what <em>others</em> do; we have ‘strategic interaction’. Economists usually consider this using the framework and tools of <em>game theory</em>.</p>

<p>Asymmetric information–where one side knows something the other doesn’t– complicates our analysis. Another approach to considering strategic interactions involves enforcable contracts (but some elements that cannot be put into these contracts); this falls under ‘the theory of the Principal and Agent’ or ‘Mechanism Design.’ This has of particular interest to many students in previous years, so I add some coverage of this.</p>

<p>People may not actually make decisions in the hyper-rational way we have been assuming. Here we carefully consider the adaptation of some insights from Psychology to Economics, yielding ‘behavioral economics’.</p>

<p>We are building models based on very precisely defined assumptions, usually assuming things like a ‘single representative consumer’. These models are seductive and very helpful for clearly conveying insights.</p>

<p><strong>Major theme: Markets work well but not perfectly. Imperfections in existing markets <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> opportunities.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>I don’t want you to go away thinking that economists believe, ‘markets solve everything, markets yield the best of all possible worlds’. The simplest models do aim to show the conditions under which this holds, but that is not a good characterization of most economic work. Most economists recognize the existence of market failures, and I believe that most recognize the usefulness of government intervention in many cases. Difference of opinion mainly arise over the prevalence of these market failures, and the extent to which government can do a good job of fixing them, or ends up making things worse.</p>
<p>I’m not telling you what <em>you</em> need to believe, I just don’t want you to have a false impression of mainstream Economics.</p>
<p>As I also mentioned, these apparent imperfections or market failures actually can lead to opportunities to create value and profit. Things that were once market failures might be solved by technology or new frameworks.</p>
<p>Here are some possible examples.<br />
</p>
<p><em>Imperfection:</em> Inefficient monopoly markups for information goods<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> ‘All you can eat’ <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <font color='blue'>Spotify, Netflix, Kindle Unlimited</font><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><font color='gray'>When people who value certain goods which could be shared with them at no cost, are nonetheless priced out of this market, this represents an inefficiency. The only price per unit that will lead to the efficient amount of consumption Would here be a zero price. However, firms and content providers cannot stay in business with zero prices. On the other hand, if they can get a good signal of what people would be willing to pay for ‘all-you-can-eat’ And then charges this to them as a subscription fee, Those consumers who subscribe will then consume the efficient amount. This represents an example of a two-part tariff, a form of price discrimination which may actually increase welfare. We will learn more about price discrimination later.</font></p>
<p>Free-riding on public goods<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <font color='ForestGreen'>Disneyworld, resorts</font><br />
</p>
<p><br />
<font color='gray'>We will see that markets will not provide the efficient amount of certain goods that are non-rival and non-excludable. However (as for the information goods case), 4 large enough territory some of these things like fireworks can essentially be made excludable. Disney World has fireworks every night, and they own such a large property that they can exclude people from coming anywhere near where the fireworks are being shown, so it would be hard to free ride. They then charge an admission fee to ‘be inside of Disney World’ and then they want to make the experience of being inside Disney World as nice as possible, so they produce a great deal of what would otherwise be considered public goods.</font></p>
<p>Imperfection: Lack of information about ‘experience goods’, lack of trust in one-shot-interactions<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <font color='ForestGreen'>Uber, AirBnb</font><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another potential market failure comes from Asymmetric information (we won’t cover this in detail); consumers may not know the quality of a product until after they have purchased it. In some cases, this means no one may be able to sell a certain product because consumers will not trust its quality, the so-called ‘lemons problem’ or ‘adverse selection’. Reputation systems, particular those developed on Internet sites like Uber and Air B&amp;B, can help reduce this problem and create new markets (and profit for themselves).</p>
<hr />
<p>Shyness and fear of ‘losing face’<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <font color='ForestGreen'>Tinder</font></p>
<p>Perhaps two people want to work together, or socialize or romance each other. However they may both be afraid of the consequences of being rejected. Even though both would like to be ‘partnered’, neither will make an overture to the other because the risks seem too high.</p>
<p>A third-party intermediary, man or machine, could be set up to only share information about ‘Mutual matches’. Once again, this will create fruitful transactions and the intermediary may be also be able to profit.</p>
<p><font color='gray'>If you’re interested, see my research on this</font> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx4yfun1ctxuezw/LosingFace.pdf?dl=0">here</a>, presentation slides <a href="http://wp.me/aZhn3-c8">here</a>, my research page is <a href="https://wordpress.com/page/davidreinstein.wordpress.com/18">here</a>.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Asymmetric information, adverse selection<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <font color='ForestGreen'>NHS, ‘Obamacare’</font></p>
<p>This one <em>is</em> a government intervention, obviously. However, private corporations are very deeply involved in these markets and healthcare systems; even in the UK, where healthcare Is perhaps more Directly provided by the government than anywhere else in the world, there are private providers like BUPA.</p>
<p>Insurance markets can fail because of a problem of ‘adverse selection’. A given set of insurance policies will tend to be more attractive to those people who envision their at more risk; in the context of health insurance, more likely to become sick and require hospitalization. Because of this, insurance companies will need to charge rates that reflect risks for the less healthy population. Because of this, healthier people may be ‘priced out of the market’, i.e., prefer to not obtain insurance. This may be inefficient because Even these healthy people may be ‘risk-averse’, and would benefit from purchasing ‘actuarially fair insurance’ (We will define these terms later).</p>
<p>There is a strong case to be made that a mandate to purchase insurance (or system of fines and subsidies) can improve overall outcomes in these situations. This is the logic behind several healthcare systems and proposals, including the USA Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama administration, and some aspects of the Netherlands’ system as well.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Firms themselves do not typically use markets: if we look inside the firm and see all sorts of mechanisms to correct or circumvent internal markets. Understanding when and why firms do this, and the trade-offs involved, can help you be a better manager. For example, when should you ‘outsource’ and when should you keep a task in house? When should you offer employees very strong incentives and when should you just tell them what to do?</p>

<p><font color='gray'>Comprehension Q: Consider some examples of ‘relevant choices’ for economic study. </font></p>

<p>Consider: Are they ‘fully realistic’? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications.</p>

<div id="why-learn-these-models" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Why learn these models?</h2>
<p>Consider the parable of the tortoise and the hare (Aesop)…</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="picsfigs/tortoisehare.jpg" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br> </p>

<p>One might question the realism of this story:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can hares really speak?</p></li>
<li><p>Is this a rabbit or a hare?</p></li>
<li><p>What other animals were racing?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, the story is not so realistic. However, it conveys an important message. Is this message in any way affected by the answers to the above questions?</p>
<p>The same can be asked about many criticisms of simple economic models. Of course one should always consider the applicability of particular models to real-world problems, and carefully consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and relevant, and whether the departures from these assumptions will lead to any different predictions. However, in considering the general insight conveyed by the model, some criticisms can merely be distracting. At the very least, we should not reject economic models simply because they are not fully realistic, just as we do not reject Aesop’s fables because they involve talking animals. The idea of ‘Ceteris paribus’ (all other things being equal) can help us here.</p>

<h3>The PPF: a ‘model’ and a way of seeing things</h3>
<p><img src="picsfigs/PPF_text.png" width="80%" height="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Above, we see a depiction of the “production possibility frontier” (PPF), explained in the figure’s caption. You may be familiar with this from your previous study. The PPF describes the maximum amount of one good that can be produced conditional on a certain quality of another good being produced.</p>
<p>The NS text claims…</p>
<p><strong>PPF illustrates key principles</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Principle 1: Scarce Resources</p>
<p>Principle 2: Scarcity involves opportunity cost.<br />
</p>
<p><em>Notes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The opportunity cost of a good is measured by the alternative uses that are foregone producing it.</li>
<li>The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone ‘next best’ opportunity from a choice.</li>
<li>I may just call this ‘cost’</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Comprehension question (advanced):</em> <font color='blue'>Think of an example that illustrates the distinction between what is commonly thought of as the ‘cost’ and the economists’ definition of an ‘opportunity cost’</font></p>
<p>On the PPF the opportunity cost of more clothing is less food.<br />
</p>
<p>Principle 3: Opportunity costs are (often) increasing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What this means is that as you produce more of one good, its opportunity cost (in terms of the other good foregone) increases.</p></li>
<li><p>The “law” of diminishing marginal returns.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>However</strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure if I would call this a ‘model’, but it certainly provides a way of visualizing the trade-offs in an economy, and the way it is drawn embody certain assumptions. This graphic has a mathematical representation which we will not cover now.</p>
<p>To make this more clearly a ‘model with assumptions’, let’s assume an economy with</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Two possible goods: food and clothing</p></li>
<li><p>A single input into the production process for either good labour (L)</p></li>
<li><p>The economy has a fixed supply of labour <span class="math inline">\(\bar{L}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The production function for food is <span class="math inline">\(F_f(L)\)</span> and the production function for clothing is <span class="math inline">\(F_c(L)\)</span>, with both ‘strictly and continuously increasing in their argument’. All firms have these same production functions (this implies there are no spillovers/externalities between firms, and no complementarities between producing each good)</p></li>
<li><p>Both production functions exhibit diminishing returns to scale (we leave off the maths for how to precisely define this for now)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p>These assumptions could be considered a ‘model’ of an economy. Note that not everything has been specified, e.g., we might ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many firms are there?</li>
<li>How do the firms compete in output and input markets?</li>
<li>What exactly are these production functions?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also clearly unrealistic elements, e.g.,</p>
<ul>
<li>Only two goods</li>
<li>Only one input</li>
<li>No complementarities in production</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, the assumptions given will yield a PPF with the shape above: the ‘feasible production set’ of the economy will have a particular shape. It’s ‘maximal elements’ constitute the ‘frontier’ of this set, which will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>downward-sloping, because each unit of the input (<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>) used to produce clothing cannot be used to produce food.</p></li>
<li><p>concave (increasing opportunity costs), because of the diminishing returns to scale for each good … as more labour is diverted to clothing away from food, it becomes less and less relatively productive</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This seems to convey an insight that 1. teaches us a way of thinking and 2. seems likely to carry over into more ‘realistic’ models. At the very least, it suggests that, under any economic system, there <em>may</em> be tradeoffs between how much of each good or service can be consumed. E.g., policymakers may need to consider ‘should we have more health care or more non-health consumption’, rather than simply saying ‘we should provide the best health care that money can buy to everyone.’<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The ‘<em>increasing</em> opportunity costs’ insight seems more fragile, more dependent on a fairly strong assumption. How do we know that there are diminishing returns to scale for each good? There are plausible reasons why it may be the opposite… returns to specialisation as an economy, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Furthermore, the model at <em>this</em> level of simplicity cannot speak to a number of questions.</p>
<p>E.g., without a sense of the market structure (how many firms and how do they compete), we do not know whether we will <em>attain</em> the PPF– the economy may end up producing at the inferior point ‘C’, for example.</p>
<p>A ‘simpler’ model is not necessarily better, nor necessarily worse.</p>
<p>Note: <font color='RawSienna'>For comprehension: <em>Be sure you can draw the PPF; consider its slope and what it means</em>.</font></p>

What are the limitations to the analysis as discussed in the text?
How would you estimate the 'return'; Who should we compare?  What years of data are these based on -- does it tell us about *future* returns?

Should the government subsidise it?  Won't people get the optimal education without subsidies?

## Application 1.3: Rise and Fall of Blockbuster

*Critical contemporary business challenge*:

(Note edition 12 is updated and discusses  Netflix, etc) Blockbuster and Netflix are selling what we call *information goods*. These have a zero marginal (distribution) cost. They are competing with online merchants.

This is characteristic of many things 'online'


> In a turnabout in policy, Blockbuster agreed to give the studios a substantial share (as much as 40 percent) of the revenues from its movie rentals in exchange for price reductions of up to 90 percent.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.9</span> Marshall’s Model of Supply and Demand</h2>
<p>Economists and philosophers have long sought to explain ‘what determines the prices, and why do they change the way they do?’</p>
<p>In the 19th century UK prices were falling while quantities were increasing; this was a puzzle.</p>
<p>Alfred Marshall argued that a good’s price must equal <em>both</em> the cost to produce and the value (to consumers) of the last unit produced and consumed.</p>
<p>He introduced the ‘demand curve’; <em>with a downward slope</em>.</p>
<p>This slope was justified by ‘satiation’: for an individual, additional units of a good are usually valued less and less. For example, you might be willing to pay thousands of pounds to be able to access 100 gallons of water rather than no water at all, but if you already have access to a thousand gallons of water, you will not be willing to pay very much for an additional 100 gallons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, firms must cater to less and less keen consumers as they wants to sell more and more units. We come back to this later in the module.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>‘Willingness to pay’ (wtp) becomes less and less for the next unit purchased, so will buy more only at a lower price. Equivalently, at a lower price more people find the value exceeds the price, and for additional units.</p>
<p><font color='gray'>Note that we will also return to these questions in more depth in later chapters as we build up the demand and supply curves.</font></p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>With ‘single crossing’ (a fancy condition you can ignore at least for now) there is a unique price where <span class="math inline">\(Q^s(p)=Q^d(p)\)</span>,
and a unique quantity where the last unit’s value to the consumer equals its cost to produce.</p>
<p><strong>Scissors analogy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The equilibrium model is analogised to a pair of scissors; neither <em>scis</em> cuts alone</li>
</ul>
<p>So <em>don’t</em> ask ‘how does the price affect the quantity exchanged’?</p>
<ul>
<li><font color='blue'>Understand why</font> ‘Just like neither scis cuts alone, neither the supply nor the demand curve determines the equilibrium price and quantity in isolation’?</li>

<p>Be sure you can explain</p>

<li><p>The inefficiency of any price other than where <span class="math inline">\(Q^D(p)=Q^S(p)\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>If the price was set at a different value, what forces might push it to the equilibrium?<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>

<p><em>‘Verifying’ economic models</em> by examining validity of <em>assumptions</em> upon which models are based. Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.?</p>
<p><em>DR: ‘Verifying’ is a bit too black and white’; all models have limitations.</em></p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>Note:</em> NS is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions. However, there are many cases in which the <em>predictions</em> of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms. On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as ‘constant relative risk aversion’ or ‘geometric discounting’ can be very credibly tested. We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure ‘how close’ behavior is to the assumption.}</p>

<p><em>Note: Verifying economic models</em> by asking whether models can accurately <em>predict</em> real-world events. If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid.</p>

<p>Consider a production function:</p>

<p>Setting this equal to 1 we can map out ‘all combinations of K and L that produce output <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span>’.</p>
<p>We do this by solving for the amount of K needed to produce 1 as a function of L
and then plotting this against a range of L</p>

Econometrics has taken on a larger role in economics over the past 40 years, because of greater data availability and computing power.

<p>Throughout the module we will come back to the discussion of empirical work, testing, measuring, and estimating.</p>

<div id="empirical-meta-example" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.14</span> Empirical meta-example</h2>
<p>Suppose we are trying to estimate the market demand curve; suppose we hypothesize that this demand curve is a linear function.
(I.e., suppose we assume that quantity demanded is a linear function of price).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q_d = a-bp\]</span></p>
<p>Suppose we know that price is changing because of cost changes, shifts in supply curve, or the firm experimenting.</p>
<p><font color='RawSienna'> Otherwise the problem is poorly identified, as demand and supply will jointly determine price</font></p>
<p>We observe price and quantity data for a period where <em>ceteris paribus</em> is reasonable, such as the data below<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="picsfigs/demanddata.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We try to fit the ‘best’ line through these points (minimizing the distances between the line and the points, or minimizing the ‘error’ of this predicted quantity)</p>
<p>We estimate the demand curve’s slope and intercept.
We can use this to make inferences.</p>
<p>This line will never fit exactly, because of unobserved differences, nonlinear demand, measurement error, randomness in behaviour.</p>
<p>But this fitted line is <em>only</em> meaningful if we are observing shifts in the <em>supply curve and not the demand curve</em>! <font color='blue'>(Can you explain why?)</font></p>

<div id="ceteris-paribus" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Ceteris paribus</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>All [most] economic theories employ the assumption that ‘other things are held constant.’</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In above data/figure, demand may differ between weeks/stores, weather may change, etc.</li>
<li>‘the points may lie on several different demand curves, and attempting to force them into a single curve would be a mistake.’
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> We would like to carefully ‘control’ for other observable factors</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><font color='RawSienna'>May also use flexible functions permitting heterogeneity – differing <em>slopes</font>.</em></p>
<p>We can never control for everything or know ‘true’ functional form. Sadly, all <em>empirical</em> work involves imperfect compromises.</p>
<p>But happily there are ways to test and validate the estimates, e.g., see how well they predict future outcomes.</p>

<div id="exogenous-and-endogenous-variables" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.15</span> Exogenous and endogenous variables</h2>
<p>Suppose a model of supply and demand with ‘exogenous shifters’:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is an external or <em>exogenous</em> variable that increases the quantity demanded at any price
<ul>
<li>E.g., the amount of a windfall tax rebate, boosting net income</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is an <em>exogenous</em> variable that makes production more costly, increasing the price firms require to supply a particular quantity
<ul>
<li>E.g., the level of the minimum wage, or e.g., energy prices</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>We can then write the supply and demand model as:
<span class="math display">\[Q=-P+W\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P=Q+Z\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>P and Q are the <em>endogenous</em> variables
<ul>
<li>Don’t ask ‘how does P change in Q?’</li>
</ul></li>
<li>W and Z are the <em>exogenous</em> variables
<ul>
<li>If we know W and Z we can solve for the equilibrium Q and P</li>
<li>Can observe how this equilibrium responds to shifts in Q and P</li>
</ul></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.16</span> Changing world oil prices</h2>
<p>NS application 1A.3, also discussed in <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/principles-of-economics">PRUM</a> section 4.1.</p>
<p>I’m showing this just to give you an easy example of how economic theory and empirical evidence are combined to bring answers to useful questions.
This is a great example from perhaps the most important unified global market, with tremendous fluctuations that have huge impacts.
It shows the power of empirical microeconomics.</p>

<p><img src="glasses.png" width="20%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
<p>Henceforth we will refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>market demand</em> curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as <span class="math inline">\(Q_D(P,...)\)</span> and</li>
<li>the <em>market supply</em> curve, as a function of price (P) and other things, as <span class="math inline">\(Q_S(P,...)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quantity (units of a good) that firms in the market are willing to supply is a function of the price and other ‘background’ things. The total quantity that consumers in the market or willing to demand is a different function of the price of other things. We typically these ‘supply curve’, and ‘demand curve’, respectively, but I want to to think of these as functions that can shift. I don’t want you to write ‘demand went down’; that is ambiguous.</p>
<p>The price where these quantities are equal is the ‘prevailing price in the market’. We build this up throughout the next sections in more detail.</p>
<p>Getting back to the example…</p>
<p>Empirical work has estimated the equations below, the estimated supply and demand curves expressed in dollars and millions of <em>barrels</em>, from an earlier period:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Q_D = 85 - 0.4P \: (D) \]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ Q_S = 55 + 0.6P \: (S) \]</span></p>
<p>Setting <span class="math inline">\(Q_S=Q_D\)</span> and solving this yields: <span class="math inline">\(85 - 0.4P=55+0.6P \rightarrow P = 30, Q = 73\)</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This approximates the 2000-2002 price</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>So what accounted for price rise in 2008 to about US$130, and then fall to US$50 by March 2009?</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>China and India’s economy grew, implying a growth in the world economy by 3-4% per year</p></li>
<li><p>Various calculations imply that this represents a shifting out in the Demand curve from <span class="math inline">\(Q_D = 85 - 0.4P\)</span> to:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\]</span></p>
<p><font color='gray'>Side note:</font> I think the ‘new demand’ curve comes from an approximation: if the world economy grew at 4% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it’s previous size. … thus the growth is <span class="math inline">\(1.047^7=1.316\)</span>.
They assume oil’s demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112.
Note that the text has a typo: equation 3 on page 40, the new demand, should read <span class="math inline">\(Q=112-0.4P\)</span>.</p>
<p>With the same supply curve and the new demand curve we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q_D = 112 - 0.4P\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[Q_S = 55 + 0.6P\]</span></p>
<p>This <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> solves to <span class="math inline">\(P=57, Q=87\)</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, overall price inflation, US$ devaluation <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> accounts for about a price of US$94</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>So why was did the price move to $130?</p>
<p>Other changes included: Speculation, other disruptions. <em>Supply</em> may have also shifted (political turmoil, new sources of energy, etc.)</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><font color='blue'>Do you know the current price of oil per barrel in USD and GBP?</font></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.18</span> Between first and second week; priority home-study</h2>
<p>Make sure you are following along.</p>
<p>Can you answer the questions mentioned above and in the lecture?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>E.g., can you explain why (supply) demand curves slope (upwards) downwards?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you solve a system of two equations (supply, demand) for an equilibrium price and quantity?</p></li>
<li><p>What causes shifts versus movements along the demand curve?</p></li>
</ul>
<!--
 Can you explain 'how economists use models and why'?
-->
<p>After week 1, before week 2 lectures, be sure you have read/understood all of the ‘handout’ and corresponding material up to this point.</p>
<p>To prepare for the week 2 lectures, you should look ahead at the readings and handout material (below).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In particular, read and consider the material on ‘preference axioms’, ‘utility functions’, and how the latter are depicted using indifference curves. These are difficult and somewhat abstract concepts; try to test your understanding and bring questions (or ask these on the VLE)!</p></li>
<li><p>If you have time, please also start considering the budget constraints and conditions for consumer optimisation. In particular, the ‘bang for the buck’ condition is something you will want to look at closely to get your head around it.</p></li>
