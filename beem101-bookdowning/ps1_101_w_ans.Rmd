### Problem 1: simple demand and supply curves, computation, inference {-}


![](picsfigs/ns_prob1.png)

**Express the algebraic equation for  these lines.**

\

**Answer (suggested answer guidelines)**



- (Recall GCSE maths formula for straight line: $y=mx+b$)

- This is a linear function $P = a+bQ$ (when we get to demand, we allow $b$ to be negative)

*Essentially repeating the above 'rise over run' calculation'...*

- For supply, increase P by 1 and Q increases by 200. (See diagram)
    - i.e, for $\Delta P = 1$, $\Delta Q = 200$
    - ... implying that if price were to increase by 1, firms would be willing to provide 200 more units in total

```{block2,  type='note'}

Doing this more carefully ... if we have any two points, $x_1,y_1$ and $x_2,y_2$ we can compute the slope $m= \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$, again 'rise over run'.

```

`r format_with_col("Take any two points on the supply curve (the table above), and compute this to get the slope.","gray")`

E.g., $(P_1,Q_1)$ = $(1,100)$ and $(P_2,Q_2)$=$(2,300)$.  The slope is thus $\frac{(300-100)}{(2-1)}=200.$ as stated above. However, this is the slope of $Q$ in $P$.


```{block2,  type='tip'}
	Confusingly, although economists usually consider how $Q$ changes in $P$ along supply (or demand curves), our convention is to plot $P$ on the vertical axis an $Q$ on the horizontal. So, when drawing the slope, remember to keep this straight. If the slope of Q in P is 200, the slope of P in Q is actually the inverse of this, namely $1/200$. (Check: $\frac{P_2-P_1}{Q2-Q1}=1/200$). Also note that a slope of $1/200$ would look almost flat, so it's better to make the quantity axis in units of 100, so you can do a slope of 1/2 (vertical increase of 1 units for each 2 units of horizontal increase).

```

\

Thus $\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q} = \frac{1}{200}$

- We know the slope $b=\frac{1}{200}$

- $\rightarrow P = a + \frac{q}{200}$

\

*What about the intercept $a$?*
Just plug some value into the formula and solve for this.

- at $P=2$, $Q=300$
- $\rightarrow 2 = a + \frac{300}{200} = a + \frac{3}{2}$
- so $a = \frac{1}{2}$

Thus the equation is $P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{Q_s}{200}$
- or $Q_s=200P-100$

```{block2,  type='tip'}
Check: does this equation describe the graph? Is it intuitive? Supply upward-sloping in price. Intercept: $P>1/2$ necessary for a positive quantity supplied.

```

\

For demand, increase P by 1 and Q declines by 100.

- Solves similarly to above:
    - $\rightarrow$ $P=8-\frac{Q_d}{100}$ or $Q_d=800-100p$

\

```{block2,  type='tip'}

This was the intuitive way.
Another way to do this is to simply plug two points into $P = a+bQ$  and solve these equations:

Start with the point $P=1, Q=100$

$$1 = a+b\times 100 \leftrightarrow$$
$$1 - a = b\times 100 \leftrightarrow$$
$$b = (1 - a)/100$$

Now we plug this expression for b (the slope) into the formula at another point, the point $P=2, Q=300$.

$$2 = a+b\times 300$$ Plugging in $b=(1 - a)/100$ $\rightarrow$
$$2 = a + \frac{1 - a}{100} \times 300 = a + 3(1 - a) = 3-2a$$ $\leftrightarrow$
$$1=2a \leftrightarrow a = 1/2$$

Now we can plug this in to solve for b:
$$b = (1 - a)/100 = \frac{1}{2}/100 = 1/200$$

Again, this yields the supply curve $P = 1/2 + Q/200$
which is the same as $Q_s=200P-100$

```




### 1.1.C: Use your solutions from part b to calculate the "excess demand" for orange juice if the (imposed) market price is zero {-}

Note that for the supply curve, quantity supplied is never negative -- below a certain price, it will just be zero.

- Consider: (why) does this make sense?

*More technically, firms choose among their feasible 'production sets', which must be non-negative.

\

**Ans:**

- Draw these functions on the same graph to aid intuition
- $Q_d(P)=800-100P$ $\rightarrow$ $Q_d(0)=800$
- $\rightarrow$ Excess demand at $P = 0$ is $Q_d(0)-Q_s(0)=800-0 = 800$.

*Consider: does this make sense? If the government declared 'orange juice must be free' and imposed no subsidies, would you expect there to be excess demand?*




\

### MCQs from previous exams, slightly adjusted  {-}

\

**MCQ3  True or false: It is valid to plot observed prices and quantities traded in a market and fit a line through them to estimate a market demand curve.**


**Answer:**
False.  "If we plot prices and quantities traded in a market, we are be observing the interaction of shifts in supply and demand curve, so it is difficult to estimate either curve without further assumptions."

`r format_with_col("Extension question: what conditions might you need to be able to estimate a market demand curve from data?","blue")`


\

**MCQ2 True or False: One example of microdata is a set of over 5 million observations of income, hours worked, and demographic information from over 1 million households' tax returns over five years.**

<br> \bigskip


**Answer:**

True. Microdata refers to the level of the unit of observation; the economic decision-maker, such as an individual or household, rather than an aggregation, such as an entire country or market. 65\% got this one right.

Note – this was covered in the mini-lecture ‘Empirical microeconomics/econometrics’ as well as in the NS text.


Note^[One might argue that this involves *some* level of aggregation, as the household may consist of multiple individuals.
However, conventionally household-level data is considered micro-data, perhaps because:
1. We typically (but not always) consider the household as a decision-making agent, the 'unitary household model)
2. This is not 'very aggregated' and still has many many independent units. We typically consider it microdata unless it is aggregated, e.g., at the level of a region or country.
]

I want you to have more than just a ‘textbook theoretical’ understanding. Understanding how data is used in business, economic analysis, and policy, will be very important in your career (as well as for your research project, if you are doing one)!

**MCQ5: True or false: If people who attended university earn more than those who did not, this proves that university makes people more productive. **

(Extension: What conditions would be necessary to obtain credible evidence on this question?)


'


**Answer:**

False. Those who attended university may have had a greater potential to earn money whether or not they *actually* attended university. They may have been more skilled, hardworking, etc.

If we had a clean experiment randomly assigning people to university we might be able to credibly assert that attending university did *cause* later outcomes, and perhaps caused these people to earn more money. However, we still would not that this occurred through the *channel* of making people more productive. There are other reasons why completing university may increase income other than 'making people more productive'.

### Consider the following utility function (direct maximisation) {-}

```{block2,  type='note'}
Note, these examples are taken from the "theory of consumer choice" section in the Autor notes. But try it on your own first.
```

$$U(x,y) = \frac{1}{4} ln x + \frac{3}{4} ln y$$ where 'ln' denotes the natural log.

**A. Show that this utility function satisfies 'global nonsatiation'**

\

**Answer**: Remember our definition of 'global nonsatiation' for differentiable functions:^[Also note that global nonsatiation is a *stronger* condition than local  nonsatiation: if global holds than local must also hold.]

Global nonsatiation:

$$\frac{\partial U(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_i}>0 \: \forall i\:  \forall \mathbf{x}$$ 

I.e.,  at any consumption bundle $\mathbf{x}$ the marginal utility of each good is positive.
\

Here $MU_x = \frac{\partial U(x,y)}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial(\frac{1}{4} ln x + \frac{3}{4} ln y)}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{4x} \: >0 \: \forall x>0$. 

Here $MU_y = \frac{3}{4y} \: >0 \: \forall x>0$. 

(Note that as consumption of either good goes to zero the utility converges to $-\infty$).

As this is always positive for both goods (at least for positive levels of consumption, and with positive income individuals with this utility function  will certainly consume a positive amount of each),  global nonsatiation holds.

(Note that MU is *decreasing* in  the consumption of each good but it never becomes negative.)




\



**B. Compute the marginal rate of substitution for this utility function. Does it exhibit 'a 'diminishing marginal rate of substitution'?**

\

**Answer**:  we can either

ii. Explicitly totally differentiate this for this particular function, as in the Autor notes: 

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='65%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/dmrs_cobbdoug_autor_calc.png")
```

ii. Recall our general formula for MRS as the ratio of marginal utilities:  $MRS(x,y) = \frac{MU_x(x,y)}{MU_y(x,y)}$  (amount of y you will give up to attain a bit of x at point x,y) and plug in the values computed in the previous part $\rightarrow$ 
$\frac{MU_x(x,y)}{MU_y(x,y)}=\frac{4y}/{12x} = \frac{y}{3x}$



\

As Autor notes, this is increasing in the amount of y consumed ... The willingness to give up x for y is of course the reciprocal of this, $\frac{3x}{y}$ which is increasing in the amount of $x$ consumed. 

\

This is what we refer to as diminishing marginal rate of substitution.  This is the 'normal thing we expect' as you become relatively satiated with goods you have more of. The reason we call it *diminishing* MRS is because it diminishes as you move down a standard indifference curve (less X, more Y)... hmm, I can see why this terminology could be confusing.


\

**C. Suppose an individual had the above utility function, and prices and income were:**

$p_x=1, p_y=2, I=12$.

- **Solve for the individual's choice of each good here**

There are a few ways to do this:

i. Impose the constraint directly by rearranging the budget constraint so that $y=\frac{I-p_x x}{p_y}$, here $y =\frac{12-x}{2}$.   Plugging this into the utility function  yields a maximization problem in one variable without a constraint (other than the non-negativity constraints).

$$max_{x} U(x,\frac{I-p_x x}{p_y})$$

Here,   plugging in our specific utility function and  income and price parameters:

\
$$max_{x} \frac{1}{4} ln (x) + \frac{3}{4} ln \frac{12-x}{2} = max_{x} \frac{1}{4} ln (x) + \frac{3}{4} ln (12-x) - \frac{3}{4}ln(2)$$

FOC: Taking the partial derivative wrt $x$ and setting it to 0:

$$\frac{1}{4x} + \frac{3}{4(x-12)} \: = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{3}{(x-12)}=0  \rightarrow$$

$$\frac{1}{3x} = \frac{1}{12-x} \rightarrow 3x= 12-x \rightarrow 4x=12 \rightarrow x^*=3  $$

Plugging in to the modified budget constraint: 
$y^{*} =\frac{12-x}{2} = (12-3)/2 = \frac{9}{2}$

\

ii. Set up the *general* Lagrangian or general optimization necessary conditions (see [Khan 'just skip the Lagrangian'](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/constrained-optimization/a/lagrange-multipliers-examples) that the gradient of the target and constraint function must align. This will yield the conditions
$$\frac{MU_x(x,y)}{MU_y(x,y)} = \frac{p_x}{p_y}$$ and     
$$I-xp_x-yp_y = 0$$.

Then plug in the specific values for this problem and simplify/solve.

iii. Set up the Lagrangian/optimisation specific for *this utility function and budget constraint*, plug in specific values and solve; this is basically what Autor's notes do (although they jump a bit between general and specific)

\

```{block2,  type='note'}
Note in all of this you must check your solution and consider the non-negativity constraints which we did *not* impose above. If your solution yields a negative consumption choice of $x$ or $y$ or both then it cannot be right. However, if it yields positive values then the  no negativity constraint did not "bind", i.e. it did not matter you were okay ignoring it.

Here you knew in advance that the FOC of this utility function would never yield a negative solution for either good -- do you know why?

```  

\


- **How much additional utility, at the margin would be provided by an additional \$1 of income. Is this a meaningful concept?**

```{block2,  type='tip'}
Here you can do this either with the Lagrangian method or by plugging the constraints into the optimising equation, leaving income $I$ as an argument.
```

The value of the Lagrange constant tells us this, as Autor's notes demonstrate in general (sec 2.3; also an application of the 'envelope theorem')

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/autor_lagrange_general.png")
```

```{block2,  type='note'}

*Wait*, he said this tells us how *Utility* increases, but here he only demonstrates that this is the total derivatives of the *Lagrange* function wrt *I*. (Note it's the *total* and not partial derivative because $x$ and $y$ are allowed to adjust.)   But notice the third term in the Lagrangian function; at optimum,  spending all income, this equals zero  and what's left is just the utility. Also  note that we see the envelope theorem 'working'  here, as, because the values of x and y are set optimally, those inner parentheses terms are 0.
```

So,  know that we believe that this is represented by $\lambda$,  we simply need to compute $\lambda$ for this case, as Autor shows us:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/autor_lagrange_example.png")
```

Plugging  in our solutions for $x^*$ and $y^*$ yields $1/(4\times 3)=1/12$ and $\frac{3}{8(9/2)}=1/12$.
\


So, at this point (the optimum point given these prices and income) an  additional unit of income yields utility at the rate $1/12$ per dollar.  

\
Is this is a meaningful concept? No. We don't see the *absolute magnitude*  utility as meaning anything in the consumer optimization context. We  would not have been able to distinguish this from a utility  function that yielded twice as much utility per dollar everywhere. (However,  when we apply the same optimization framework in other contexts, particularly the production context it will be meaningful, telling us how much output  an additional dollar of costs will produce.)


\

We also could have derived this by solving the problem in general but holding $I$ (and, if you like, prices) as a variable solving for optimised utility,  and  computing the derivative of this with respect to income. (I'll add this here when I have a moment).



### Indirect utility function  example {-}

Suppose $$U(x,y) = x^{\frac{1}{2}}y^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ (Cobb-Douglas with CRS and symmetry between the two goods).

Derive the optimal consumption (the individual demand functions) for x and y as a function of income $I$ and prices $p_x$ and $p_y$.

\

**Answer:**

There are lots of shortcuts to solving this. I solved this same case in the web-book [above](cobbdoug). Autor gives us the most complicated way to solve it, with the full Lagrangian:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='65%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/autor_cobbdoug_lagrange.png")
```

\

**What  'share of expenditure' goes to each good?  Weird, huh?**

\

**Answer:** Half to each. Thus this will not be an adequate 'flexible' functional form of utility to use in empirical work nor in 'toy' theoretical examples. Imposing this function (or any Cobb-Douglas, or more generally, any homothetic utility function) will rule out important income effects.

\

**Now plug these functional forms  into the original utility function to derive the 'Indirect utility function' as a function of income and prices. What is the interpretation of this function, which we will denote $V(p_x,p_y,I)$?**

\

**Answer:**

The 'regular' utility function we are considering is 

$$U(x,y) = x^{\frac{1}{2}}y^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
Plugging in the optimised choices $x^{*} = \frac{I}{2p_x}$ and  $y^{*} = \frac{I}{2p_y}$ yields the indirect utility function

$$V(I,p_x,p_y) = (\frac{I}{2p_x})^\frac{1}{2} (\frac{I}{2p_y})^\frac{1}{2}$$

... 'tell me prices and income, and I'll tell you your utility'.

(There will be an equivalent to this on the production side as well... telling us how much output can be produced by an optimizing firm willing to incur a certain cost, given particular input prices.)

\

### Roy's identity example {-}

**Now take the partial derivative of the above indirect utility function $V(p_x,p_y,I)$ with respect to the price of x $p_x$. What is the interpretation of this?**

\


**Ans**: 

$$\frac{\partial V(\cdot)}{\partial p_x}= -\dfrac{I}{2^\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{\frac{I}{p_x}}p_x^2}(\frac{I}{2p_y})^\frac{1}{2}$$

Interpretation: How (optimised) utility changes (decreases) as the price of X increases, at a given value of   

\

This is kind of a mess: too much algebra. Let me simplify the example by using the equivalent utility function $u=xy$.

This yields indirect utility 

$$\tilde{V}(I,p_x,p_y) = (\frac{I}{2p_x}) (\frac{I}{2p_y})= \frac{I^2}{4p_yp_x} =  \frac{I^2}{4p_y}p_x^{-1} $$

Derivative wrt the $p_x$ is just 
$$\frac{\partial \tilde{V}(\cdot)}{\partial p_x}=-\frac{I^2}{4p_yp_x^2}$$

Again, interpretation: How (optimised) utility changes (decreases) as the price of X increases, starting from the optimal choices and utility at a given value of income and prices.

\


**Now take the partial derivative of the above indirect utility function** $V(p_x,p_y,I)$ **with respect to income** $I$. **What is the interpretation of this?**

**Ans**: 

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial I}   \frac{I^2}{4p_yp_x}   = \frac{2I}{4p_yp_x}  $$

Interpretation: How (optimised) utility changes (decreases) as the income increases, starting from the point achieved with a particular income and prices... this is the same as the $\lambda$ coefficient in the Lagrangian. 

\


**Now take the negative of the ratio of the above partial derivatives:**

**Ans**: 

$$-\frac{\partial V/\partial p_x}{\partial V/\partial I} = \frac{I^2}{4p_yp_x^2}/\frac{2I}{4p_yp_x}= \frac{1}{2}\frac{I}{p_x}   $$

\

**Check: this should yield the (Marshallian demand) for good** $x$, $d_x(p_x,p_y,I)$.

**Ans**: 
Yes, it does; recall our solution above that one always spends half of their income on good $x$.


In fact, this holds in general, for any utility function: $$-\frac{\partial V/\partial p_x}{\partial V/\partial I}= d_x(p_x,p_y,I)$$


**It's called 'Roy's identity'. Weird, huh? Do you have any intuition for this?**

\

**Ans:**

Intuition: The rate that utility decreases in the price of x divided by the rate utility increase in income, at optimum, is equal to the optimised consumption of good x. 

Numerator: The more $x$ I am consuming the more an increase in price reduces my 'income left over after consuming $x$, (holding consumption of x constant). 

Denominator: Each unit of 'reduced remaining income' costs me utility at rate $\partial V/\partial I$. 

*Voila.*

\


### Purposes of economic models, readings {-}

*This question comes from the 2018 midterm*

What are the purposes and uses of 'economic models'? Should the assumptions be `realistic'? How can these models be tested and assessed? Discuss this with reference to issues discussed in Friedman's 'The methodology of positive economics,' Sugden's (2002) 'Credible worlds: the status of theoretical models in economics' and or Sitzia and Sugden's (2011)  'Implementing theoretical models in the laboratory, and what this can and cannot achieve.' In your discussion, try to refer to specific economic models (such as Akerlof's 'Market for Lemons').

\

**Answer**

There are differing views. See discussion in web book [Differing views on the use of economic models](https://vle.exeter.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1438859/mod_resource/content/1/_book/intro.html#economic-models) and in [wiki](https://vle.exeter.ac.uk/mod/ouwiki/view.php?id=690987&page=%28Group%29+discussion+of+articles+on+modeling).
