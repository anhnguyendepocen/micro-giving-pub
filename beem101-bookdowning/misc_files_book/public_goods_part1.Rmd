*Key goals of this chunk*

1. Learn how economists define a public good
- Be able to assess whether something fits into this category
1. Understand what 'market failures are'
1. Learn and be able to explain why a competitive market will usually *undersupply* a public good (but may still supply *some* of it)
1. Understand the difficulties *government* may face in providing the right amount of a public good
1. Get a sense of the general patterns and evidence on *voluntary* provision of public goods, including in 'lab experiments'
- and what 'lab experiments' in economics are



<br> <br> \bigskip

Outline: What is a public good, why do markets fail to provide these optimally, (how) can governments provide these optimally, when do people provide these voluntarily?

<br> <br> \bigskip


**Motivation**

- Policy: The 'public goods argument' is critical to justify many government programmes (military, environmental cleanup, research, etc)
- Management: Firms/workers can only profit from providing a public good through getting subsidies or by turning it into a private good.

## Market failures

- Occur when prices don't fully reflect the marginal social benefits or costs
    - Provide scope for political intervention
    - How does this happen?
    - One potential source of market failure: Public Goods

## Public Goods (attributes, categories)

What are the characteristics of a public good?


*Def* -- A **Pure Public Good** is a good that is both

<br> <br> \bigskip

1. *Non-excludable*: Once the good is provided, it is impossible/costly to prevent any individual from using/benefiting from it.


*Note:* This even includes individuals who have not paid for it

<br> <br> \bigskip

Opposite (and alt definition)
*Exclusive goods*: ... a good is exclusive if it is relatively easy to bar people from benefitting from it once it has been produced


<br> <br> \bigskip

2. *Non-rival:* One person's consumption doesn’t reduce the quantity available for others.

- The fact that some people use the good doesn’t prevent others from using the *same* good.


- There is no “crowding.”

Alt (equivalent def):

- Providable to additional users at zero marginal (social) cost.

-  Consumption of additional units of the good involves zero marginal social cost of production. (E.g., if we had produced a film but restricted it to subscribers, the marginal social cost of letting the whole world download it is essentially zero; the exclusion would take us away from the 'utility frontier')




Q: think of some examples.


```{block2,  type='note'}

In market economies, private suppliers provide the majority of goods and services to consumers. However, certain goods are publicly provided. These include for example defense, education, and health. Why does the government instead of the market provide these goods?  Which characteristics differentiate goods that are privately provided from goods that are publicly provided? How do we define public goods?

The terminology might induce the conclusion that 'public goods are good that are publicly provided as opposed to private goods which are privately provided.' This conclusion is simply WRONG! The public or private nature of the good is an intrinsic characteristic of goods that is not related to the provider of the good
Hence, it may well be that the state provides a private good or that the market provides a public good.

## Examples, In-between's {-}


Excludable and rival (depleatable)? $\rightarrow$ *Private good*

<br> <br> \bigskip

\

*“Club goods”:* excludable but non-rivalrous (at least up to a congestion point).

\

<br> <br> \bigskip

*"Common property"*: Nonexcludable but rivalrous


<br> <br> \bigskip

“Somewhat” nonexcludable and/or “somewhat” nonrival:  $\rightarrow$  “impure public goods.”

```

**What about?**

- Recorded music
- “Information” goods (e.g., software)
- A national park
- A theatre performance
- Roads
- Clean air
- Education
- Aid to the needy
- Loud music coming from my window
- Disease control
- Economic research
- The justice system
- Fireworks in Disney World
- The 2012 Olympics in London

## The basic idea

If a good is *non-rival* then additional provision is costless.
Thus,

- if exclusion is possible, and *any* positive price is charged, some are deterred from consuming it
- this is inefficient: people who could benefit from the good, at no cost to others, will not consume it :(

If a good is *non-excludable* it will be difficult to charge people for it

- many might prefer to wait for *others* to buy it, and then they enjoy it anyways (free-ride), which could lead to coordination problems


and...

<br> <br> \bigskip


Even if each person provided it for their *own* benefit (on the assumption that no one else would), they would typically choose *too little* from a social POV...


<br> <br> \bigskip

Considering their own marginal benefits (and MRS) versus the price or cost, not the *social* marginal benefit (essentially, a positive externality)


<br> <br> \bigskip

But if firms cannot charge for its full value, they might not pay the fixed costs to develop/build/provide it

- Who would pay to produce a film that is freely pirated/distributed?
- Who would pay to develop a drug that must be priced at its marginal cost?
- Why contribute to police protection for your village, if your neighbours will pay for it anyways?


*Note:* Loosely, 'rivalryness' basically relates to whether market provision will be *efficient*; 'excludability' tells you whether firms can make *some revenue* from providing it, selling the same prooduced good to more than one person (or to a 'club' of people)

\

### Application: drug development {-}

*Drug R\&D may be a public good, or a common resource*

- Expensive to develop and introduce a new drug -- 'sunk costs' once developed
- But cheap to copy and produce; without patent protection may have $P=mc$ and no ex-post profit to compensate for sunk costs
    - $\rightarrow$ No incentive to develop drugs without patent protection guaranteeing 'excludability' and a limited monopoly
- But ex-post, patent protection is costly; drug produced for a few pennies sold for £1000's
    - People may not buy, or NHS may not cover
    - $\rightarrow$ Inefficient: some consumers may value drug at £100's, far above MC, yet they don't consume it
- Possible solution: Government *awards* and subsidies for drug development.

*Note:* In fact, governments do fund and subsidise R\&D. But there are difficulties here too. Governments may free-ride off of other governments. It is also for government to know whom to fund, hard to quantify the benefits to potential drugs, and offering 'prizes' to developers offers its own challenges: how to asses if the drug is good enough to deserve the prize? And too many firms working on the same drug may be wasteful.
