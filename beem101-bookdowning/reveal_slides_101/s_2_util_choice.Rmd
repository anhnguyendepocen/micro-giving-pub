# Chunk 2:  Utility and Choice [Chapter 2: 1-2 hours]


## Motivation (preamble)

Consider a decision you recently made?

<br> \bigskip

- Define this decision clearly.

- How do you think you decided among these options?


<!-- \pause -->

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

<aside class="notes">What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the same decision?

If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same situation again. Do you think you'd make the same decision?</aside>

----

Suppose I asked you

'State a rule that governs (determines/characterizes) how people *do* make decisions'...

<!-- . . . -->

<br> \bigskip

I want this rule to be...

1. Informative (it rules *out* at least some sets of choices)

2. Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule)

----

Similar question:

'State a rule that governs how people *should* make decisions'..

 <br> \bigskip

By 'should' I mean that *they will not regret having made decisions in this way.*

<!-- \pause -->

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

----

<big> If  people *did* follow these rules, what would this imply and predict? </big>

<!-- \pause -->

Rules defined as 'axioms about preferences'


<!-- . . . -->


<small> 'Standard axioms'  $\rightarrow$ (imply that) choices can be expressed by 'individuals maximising *utility functions* subject to their *budget constraints*' </small>


$\rightarrow$ yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc.

<aside class="notes">Economists and decision theorists have tried to come up with and defend such rules.

 They have started from these `reasonable axioms' and follow their logical implications for \textCR
individual choices, individual responses to changes in prices and income,

market prices and quantities and their responses,

`welfare' and inequality outcomes for entire economies, etc.</aside>

# Chunk 2 -- Utility and Choice -- coverage

## Key goals

**Learn, understand, be able to explain and explain:**

'Utility', how it's defined and interpreted by economists

Key assumptions about preferences/choices; their justifications and implications


. . .


Depict preferences/utility with 'indifference curves'

Examples ('perfect substitutes' and 'perfect complements', etc.)


. . .


Extensions to general forms

----



'Budget constraints', compute and model them


. . .


Maximising utility subject to constraints

- optimisation condition for this

<aside class="notes">
price ratios \& mgnl rates of substn.
</aside>


----


- Depict and interpret optimisation with indifference curves and budget constraints
    - Considering the characteristics and 'comparative statics' of this optimisation problem
    - Dual 'minimization problem'

<aside class="notes">
 Part 2 (ch 2-3) involves building the demand curve from first principles,

  and discussing how to interpret it</aside>

<aside class="notes">
- Want to develop a model that can be used to show how we make choices or decisions.

-Your choices are determined by two things:

-Preferences: what goods do you like

-Constraints: how much money do you have, what are the prices of the goods you buy

# Utility

## Utility

Utility
:     "The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity."

. . .

<br> \bigskip

:     Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions

<aside class="notes">Adv: There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv: A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated,

  thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, 'utility', which is maximised</aside>

----

*How is this used?*

<br> \bigskip

. . .


Utility will be expressed as a single number that arises from the combination of all goods and services consumed.

. . .


<br> \bigskip


>  Essentially, economists assume that 'when making a choice among all available and feasible options, an individual will choose the one that yields the greatest *utility*'


## Utility from two goods

$$Utility = U(X,Y; other)$$


\


. . .


- Leisure and 'goods consumption'

- Food and non-food

- Coffee and tea (holding all else constant)


<aside class="notes">

<small> Empirical question can we 'aggregate goods' in this way?
E.g., considering a 3-good case... do the preferences of bananas vs apples depend on the *composition* of the (e.g.) housing services bundle,
or only on some aggregated measure of 'housing sevices'. In estimating demand systems and considering price elasticities we may want/need to make such assumptions. (See, e.g., 'nested logit'.)</small>

</aside>

## Measuring and comparing utilities

<aside class="notes">Adv: This is a difficult but well-studied issue, as it is important for methodology and welfare analysis.


In more detailed discussions, we might speak of 'cardinal utility', 'ordinal utility', etc.,

 to indicate ways we can compare utility between individuals and in response to policy changes.</aside>

Utility is not 'directly observable and measurable'

. . .


(Unlike midi-chlorians or thetans)


<br> \bigskip

. . .

Utility is seen to govern an individual's *choices* and thus only inferred indirectly, from the *choices* an people make

----

**Revealed preference:** if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a dog was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/alscat.jpg")
```

<aside class="notes">

Such methods are used to try to measure the value of goods that have no observed market price, for public policy choices.
E.g., If people drove 20km to go to parK B, they must value it at at least the cost of driving there.
If people pay £20k more for a house with a view of the lake (ceteris paribus)...

	</aside>

----


*Interpersonal comparisons are difficult*


- Who gets 'more' utility?


<br> \bigskip


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/facepalmstatue.jpg")
```

----

*...Interpersonal comparisons are difficult*

- Transfer from Al to Betty: Is the reduction in Al's utility more or less than the increase in Betty's?


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/babytakingfood.JPG")
```

As we only get at utility through an *individual's* decisions, we have no reliable way to compare it across individuals

<aside class="notes">
However, there is work done in the field of public choice trying either to build this up from *axioms* (e.g., the veil of ignorance),
or by eliciting people's preferences over distributions through interesting surveys, experiments, and voting behavior.

</aside>


##

Standard utility functions are only 'identified' (only make distinct predictions) 'up to a monotonic transformation'

. . .

I.e, a 'rank preserving' transformation; like *stretching a rubber band*.


<small> I.e., a transformation f s.t. $f(U(x',y',z',...) > f(U(x,y,z,...)$ whenever $(U(x',y',z',...) > (U(x,y,z,...)$ </small>

-  E.g., multiply by a positive number, log, square, add/subtract from it;

    - the new utility function makes the same predictions; this is not helpful, because it means we cannot distinguish these empirically!


. . .


The "benefit": we can transform (e.g., log) a utility function for convenient calculation


. . .


Note: Uncertain choices $\rightarrow$ 'Von Neumann - Morgenstern' utility functions;  somewhat more restrictive, thus better identified.


<aside class="notes"
The Autor reading refers to Cardinal versus Ordinal utility. We use the latter in demand/consumer theory.

	</aside>

# Preference axioms

## Standard assumptions about preferences ('axioms')


1. Completeness

<aside class="notes">Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive.

The more formal and parsimonious definition (Autor readings, Jehle/Reny) develop this from a single relation 'weakly preferred to'.</aside>

2. Transitivity (internal consistency)




3. More is Better (*nonsatiation, or some variant of this*)


<aside class="notes">
Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive.

The more formal and parsimonious definition (Autor readings, Jehle/Reny) develop this from a single relation 'weakly preferred to'. If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.

Completeness and transitivity (and continuity) are necessary for people's choices to be represented by (continuous) *utility functions*.
Continuity is necessary for 'well behaved' (not-jumpy) demand curves.

(Local) Nonsatiation will help us derive results </aside>


----

### 1. Completeness

$$A \succ B, B \succ A, \: or \: A \sim B $$

\medskip

`r format_with_col("Fancy notation: Either A preferred to B, B preferred to A, or A indifferent to B","gray")`



. . .



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/donkeybales.jpeg")
```


Forbidden: "I can't choose between a ski holiday and a beach holiday, but I am not indifferent"

<aside class="notes">Also forbidden: the *time* or *frame* in which I make the *decisions* shouldn't affect my choices</aside>

<aside class="notes">Violations?: See, e.g., 'Predicting Hunger: The Effects of Appetite and Delay on Choice; Read and van Leeuwen, 1998... is there really a true preference here?

See also Sunstein and others on 'choosing not to choose'</aside>

----


### 2. Transitivity

$$ A \succ B \: and \: B \succ C \rightarrow A \succ C $$


- Similar for indifference ($\sim$), which is also reflexive


<aside class="notes">If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry then I prefer an Apple to a Cherry.

 A similar idea holds if I am indifferent between one pair of these.</aside>

<aside class="notes">If this seems confusing it may be because it is *too* obvious (although behavioral and experimental economists claim to find violations, see readings).</aside>

<aside class="notes">
**Technical note:** Formally, completeness of these $\succ$ and $\sim$, and the transitivity of each makes this a 'Partial Ordering' of the choice set.

	</aside>
----



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/applebananacherry.jpg")
```

If I prefer an Apple to a Banana and a Banana to Cherry


. . .


then I prefer an Apple to a Cherry.


. . .


If not $\rightarrow$ money pump.

<aside class="notes">Adv: 'Money pump' argument -- If you found someone who strictly preferred an apple to a banana, a banana to a cherry, and a cherry to an apple,

 you could make a lot of money out of them!

 </aside>


<aside class="notes">LC: Measuring violations: references in handout</aside>

### 3. More is better (similar to nonsatiation, 'monotonicity')

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/moreisbetter.png")
```

\medskip

*Draw this!*

`r format_with_col("\footnotesize{If the product is a 'bad' (e.g., pollution), redefine as the *absence","gray")` of the product*}

<aside class="notes">The darkly shaded area represents those combinations of X and Y that are unambiguously preferred to the combination X\*, Y\*.

 This is why goods are called ''goods''; individuals prefer having more of any good rather than less.

Combinations of X and Y in the lightly shaded area are inferior to the combination X\*, Y\*,

 whereas those in the questionable areas may or may not be superior to X\*, Y\*.</aside>



# Who cares?

<br> \bigskip

**If people obey the first two assumptions (axioms),$^\ast$
they will make choices in a way consistent with maximising a (continuous) *utility* function**

<br> \bigskip


*($\ast$ and also 'continuity')



<aside class="notes">silly to say people *actually* consult a utility function.

instead 'people behave as if they are maximizing utility functions';


 similar to  "people choose based on preferences that satisfy the above assumptions. </aside>

<aside class="notes">Axioms stand directly behind 'revealed preference' methods for measuring how much people value

nonmarket goods, like clean air and national parks.

Also gives a vocabulary and a way to test for violations of this consistency, and make alternate predictions</aside>


----

Continuity and nonsatiation

<aside class="notes">Continuity: If bundle A pref B and $C$ 'lies within an epsilon radius of $B$ than A pref C.

  Adding this to the previous axioms $\rightarrow$ utility representation.

 Also ensures continuous utility functions and allow ... 'marginal utility' and gradually sloping demand curves

 of course differential utility ensures continuity</aside>

 <aside class="notes">LC/CQ: What preferences (later in this chapter) suggest *not* differentiable utility? Were these continuous?(rem -- right and left shoes)

 What about 'lexicographic'? preferences</aside>

<aside class="notes">Axiom 3 (nonsatiation) makes the maths more convenient, and is necessary for some results/predictions</aside>

<aside class="notes">Strictly, most results only require the weaker 'local nonsatiation' condition</aside>


----


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/moreisbetter.png")
```


- How can we compare the "?" areas? Which are preferred?


. . .


$\rightarrow$ Compare utilities, depict using *Indifference Curves*


<aside class="notes">LC: Here, put up indifference curve picture on the visualiser</aside>

# Indifference curves

## Indifference curves

Indifference curve
:     A curve that shows all the combinations of goods or services that provide the same level of utility

<br> \bigskip


. . .


Formally (for 2 goods), the set of pairs of $\{X,Y\}$ such that $U(X,Y)=c$ for some constant $c$


. . .

For n goods, the level-sets of the $U(x_1, x_2, x_3,...)$ function.

<br> \bigskip


<aside class="notes">Recall  "level sets" from math tools</aside>

## App 2.2 : Should Economists care how the mind works?
- Look to biology, psychology, cognitive science for key principles/modeling?
- Evidence of systematic departures from maximization of a consistent and standard utility *function*
    - E.g., treating some prices differently and ignoring information
    - Self-control and 'paying not to go to the gym'
- Should we describe/model *optimizing* behavior or 'typical behavioral patterns'?

The indifference curve offers some intuition.

<aside class="notes">Individual ok giving up soda for hamburgers or v/v *along* indifference curve

*Consider if one individual had D and another A, and they had the same preferences.*</aside>

In normal-speak, a partial share of each bundle.

Note with the same DMRS for both, trades along this line make both better off;

the *points* they would trade to depends on their bargaining power</aside>

# Marginal rate of substitution (MRS)


MRS =  Absolute value of slope of indifference curve

<br> \bigskip

'Rate at which you're willing to forgo consuming ($Y$) to consume one more ($X$)'

<aside class="notes">2024, Adv, math: This slope will equal the negative of the *ratio* of the rate at which utility increases in each good (partial derivative).

   Intuition: giving up a certain utility from one good must be balanced by an increase in utility from the other good.</aside>



- (So the MRS is the ratio itself, because it's the absolute value.)

- Formally, the MRS at point $X,Y$, where $U(X,Y)=U_1$ is:


<!-- . . . -->


$$MRS(X,Y)=-\frac{dY}{dX}|U(X,Y)=U_1$$


----


*Back to fig 2.2 (board or visualiser)*

\

- A to B: willing to give up 2 hamburgers to get 1 more soda.

$\rightarrow$ slope $-2$, $MRS=2$


<!-- \pause -->

- From B to C? (think about it)


<!-- \pause -->


...willing to give up 1 hamburger to get 1 more soda $\rightarrow MRS =1$


<!-- \pause -->


- C to D?


<!-- \pause -->

$MRS = \frac{1}{2}$


<aside class="notes">Be careful: it is very easy to get the MRS inversed</aside>

<aside class="notes">Here this refers to arc slopes; however,

for continuous functions this gets closer and closer to the point slope

the smaller the arc</aside>

\


<!-- \pause -->


- Note the decline: 'diminishing MRS':  may reflect *satiation*


# Preference for variety/balance

![Fig 2.3](picsfigs/indifcurvebalance.png) \

<aside class="notes">Adv: this 'preference for variety' is thought to hold for most combinations of goods, most of the time, but perhaps not for all pairings.

It tends to lead to easy-to-solve 'interior solutions' where people may consume some amount of each good, and have smooth reactions to price changes.

Extreme of this is 'necessity' goods. </aside>

<aside class="notes">LC: Adjust previous picture on visualiser/board</aside>

<aside class="notes">With an indifference curve with this shape ('convex')


  any consumption bundle that represents a 'mixture' between two equally attractive extremes will be preferred to those extremes


E.g., if I like bundles A and D equally, I prefer a bundle of 1/3 of a and 2/3 of D to either A or D.</aside>


----

More formal concept: (strictly) convex preferences $\Leftrightarrow$  (strictly) 'quasiconcave' utility function, allowing  'n goods':


With diminishing MRS, for a 'convex combination' of the two bundles $\mathbf{A}=(X_A,Y_A)$ and $\mathbf{D}=(X_D,Y_D)$


<!-- . . . -->


$$U(\alpha\mathbf{A}+(1-\alpha)\mathbf{D})\geq\alpha U(\mathbf{A}) + (1-\alpha)U(\mathbf{D})$$

where $0<\alpha<1$.

(Note switch to a 'weak inequality' here for quasiconcavity, strict for 'strict quasiconcavity')


<!-- . . . -->

e.g., (with two goods),


$$U(\alpha X_A + (1-\alpha)X_D,\alpha Y_A + (1-\alpha)Y_D)\geq  $$
$$\alpha(U((X_A,Y_A)) + (1-\alpha)(U(X_D,Y_D))$$


<aside class="notes">One reason economists like this 'quasiconcavity' is because it rules out local, but not global optima, so we only need to use

 the first-order conditions to find the optima.

 Looking under the lamp or 'without loss of generality'?</aside>

 <aside class="notes">Note that 'quasiconcavity' does not require differentiability,

 and it is preserved under a 'monotonic transformation' (stretching).

 This means its called an 'ordinal property'</aside>

<aside class="notes">Holds for all relevant properties, including MRS; see Autor's Lecture 3</aside>

<aside class="notes">This looks like the special case of 'homothetic preferences':

- these have the same slopes as you shift them outward

implying that consumption of each good expands proportionally in income

and the impact of a single-consumer's income increasing by \$1 million will be the same as

1 million consumers' incomes increasing by \$1; this assumption underlies 'representative consumer' models</aside>

    - $\rightarrow$ a possible *niche* for a new profitable product
<aside class="notes">Class question: What may be a critique, exception to this logic, e.g., for a particular food?</aside>


<aside class="notes">SA: Convex preferences, 'preferring mixtures' a very strong assumption, unlikely to hold everywhere, or for actual *mixtures*.

  1. I'm  indifferent between liver and custard, I don't prefer  liver-flavoured custard, nor equal amounts of side by side. \textCR
- 2. Producing an 'intermediate' attribute may be more costly;

# Definitions: Perfect substitutes and complements

Perfect substitutes

:     Goods A and B are Perfect Substitutes when an individual's utility is linear in these goods

: when she is always willing to trade off A for B at a fixed rate (not necessarily 1 for 1)

----

Perfect complements

:     Goods A and B are Perfect Complements when an individual only gains utility from (more) A if she also consumes a defined (additional) amount of B, and vice-versa

<br> \bigskip

These goods are 'enjoyed only in fixed proportions'.

For each  $Y$ I give up I save $P_Y$, so the more costly is $Y$ the more I can save by giving up 1 unit of it,

thus, the less I need to sacrifice of $Y$ to get another unit of $X$.

### Budget constraint algebra


If I spend all my income `r format_with_col("(I will do over a 'relevant lifetime')","gray")`:

\

<!-- \pause -->



Expenditure on X + Expenditure on Y = Income (I)

\

$$P_X X + P_Y Y = I $$


<!-- . . . -->


To see how $Y$ trades off against $X$, rearrange this to:


<!-- . . . -->


\

$$Y = -\frac{P_X}{P_Y} X + \frac{I}{P_Y}$$


<!-- . . . -->


- Intercept $\frac{I}{P_Y}$: amount of Y you can buy if you only buy Y
- Slope $-\frac{P_X}{P_Y}$: how much Y you must give up to get another X

<!---
<aside class="notes">Adv: Strictly speaking, the slope is how much Y you *get* when you get another X,

but since this is negative we see that you 'get a negative amount', i.e., give up some amount of Y</aside>

what they mean, and have intuition for why the slope has this formula. See 'micro quiz 2.3'.</aside>

*Key intuition:*


If I can give up X for (buy less X, get more Y) at some rate, and the *benefit* I get from doing this is at a *different* rate,

### More insight


Recall $U=U(X,Y)$.

$$U_X(X,Y) := MU_X(X,Y)$$

\medskip


<!-- . . . -->


*Derivative w/ respect to X: rate utility increases if we add a little X, holding Y constant*

- Similarly for $MU_Y$.


<!-- . . . -->




MRS: 'how much Y would I be willing to give up to get a unit of X'?

<!-- . . . -->

Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each ... we can show $MRS(X,Y)=\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}$

<aside class="notes">Intuition: the more valuable a little more X is to me  -- the higher is MU_X --

  the more Y I am willing to give up to get it. That is why MU_X is in the numerator</aside>

<aside class="notes">See derivation in handout if interested</aside>


----


The 'first order change in utility' (or 'total differential') is:

$$ dU  = \frac{\partial U}{\partial X}dX + \frac{\partial U}{\partial Y}dY$$
$$ = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY$$

- Where = $\frac{\partial U}{\partial X}$ refers to the partial derivative of U(X,Y) with respect to X, and similarly for Y. I.e., the marginal utility.

<!-- . . . -->



Essentially, approximates the total change in utility for very small changes in X and Y.
Setting it equal to zero and rearranging it yields the rate, at the margin, one is willing to give up Y for X:


$$ dU  = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY = 0 $$

$$\frac{dY}{dX}=-\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}$$



<aside class="notes">This is a simple case of the implicit function theorem,

 essentially $U(X,Y)=c$ defines an implicit function Y(X), whose slope is the negative of the ratio of the derivatives.</aside>




----


Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields more intuition:

$$P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y$$
\


<!-- . . . -->


(at each consumption point X,Y)

\medskip

$$\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$$


<!-- . . . -->


Same 'bang for each buck' (`r format_with_col("if","red")` optimising)

<aside class="notes">If this didn't hold true and you were spending on both goods,

you would be paying 'more per util' for one good than the other,

and thus should reallocate to that other good.</aside>


<aside class="notes">The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point

 -- the higher is MU_x -- the more Y I'm willing to give up to get it.

That is why MU_x is in the numerator.
The more valuable a bit more Y is at that point -- the higher is MU_y -- the less Y I am willing to give up to get a bit more X.

 That is why MU_y is in the denominator</aside>

###Cobb-Douglas general form (from other text)

$$U(X,Y)=X^aY^b$$

where a, b are positive constants


<!-- . . . -->


This is *"homothetic"*:


<aside class="notes">Homothetic: MRS constant along a ray through the origin

 Can be represented by an HD1 utility function.

ties down 'income effects' in a boring way

consumption of each good expands proportionally in income,

so impact of 1 consumer's income increasing by \$1 million the same as 1 miln consumers' gaining \$1;

underlies 'representative consumer' models;

... poor man just buys a tiny amount of foies gras and jumps in a tiny money bin</aside>


$$MU_X=\frac{\partial U}{\partial X} = aX^{a-1}Y^b$$
$$MU_Y=\frac{\partial U}{\partial Y} = bX^{a}Y^{b-1}$$

Taking the ratio of these yields

$$MRS = \frac{a}{b}\frac{Y}{X}$$

$$U(X,Y)=X+ln(Y)$$

Here Y has a diminishing MU, but for X MU is constant
