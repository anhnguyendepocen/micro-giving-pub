# Outline and description:  The first chunk aims to cover:

1. Explain what this module is about and how to get the most out of it
2. Explain what Microeconomics is about and why it is useful
3. Explain what the point of 'models' are
4. Mention some *applications* of these
5. Recap some examples of microeconomic models and questions (should be largely revision)
    - Get your econ brain flowing
6. Discuss 'empirical work' in Microeconomics, and how it connects to 'theory'

## This module



BEEM101: Microeconomics


- Marks
    - Midterm, 90 minutes 35 marks
    - Final examination, 2 hours: 65 marks

- Classes every fortnight


- Plus research 'coffees' (discussion sessions) in alternate weeks, if you are interested





### Texts and resources  {-#texts} {-}

In previous years I recommended Intermediate Microeconomics and its Application (an Undergraduate text) by Nicholson and Snyder (available at the bookstore for about £50... older editions are fine too). However, you may find this to be  too basic a level, as it's meant for undergraduates. Have a look.

I am now using and recommending several other free online resources instead (or in addition).

Note that this is a 'standard core': any intermediate or advanced textbook in microeconomics will cover most of the same material.

A focal resource:

- [Introduction to
Economic Analysis - MacAffee, Lewis, Dale](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/dale/ieav21.pdf)

A 'no-fluff' text from an esteemed source. Covers much of this module, but  the level varies somewhat throughout. Includes calculus and lots of parametric examples. Lots of great content. Lots of solved problems.

I will also heavily draw on:

- [Quantum Microeconomics](http://www.smallparty.org/yoram/quantum/#downloads); consider the version either with or without calculus
    - An unconventional but very careful and interesting approach; my impression is that it is well organised and explained. You may like it!

- David Autor’s MIT Open Courseware “Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy”; [all the files for this course can be downloaded here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-03-microeconomic-theory-and-public-policy-fall-2016/lecture-notes/) this will give you a flavor of nearly-PhD-level micro


- [Microeconomics
Markets, Methods & Models
an Open Text
by Douglas Curtis and Ian Irvine](https://laecon1.lyryx.com/textbooks/OPEN_CURTIS_MIC_1/marketing/CurtisIrvine-Microeconomics-2017A.pdf)
    - A full-fledged text covering many of the topics of this module, without calculus

- [Intermediate microeconomics - M Walbert Illinois tutorials](http://my.ilstu.edu/~mswalber/ECO240/index.html) - click 'tutorials'
    - A series of tutorials for an intermediate microeconomics module. Covers many of the topics of this module. No calculus but a lot of algebra. Lots of supplementary materials too.

<aside class="notes">is similar to our text, but with more maths and formalism, and some extensions (but fewer applications)</aside>

1. Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extension (also by Nicholson and Snyder): more maths and extensions

2. David Autor's MIT Open Courseware "Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy": More rigorous, close to PhD level, includes good research applications; we'll be drawing from it

<aside class="notes">You will have seen many of these concepts before.

But do you really understand them well enough to *explain* them to a non-economist

### What is Economics?

\

\note{DR: It has changed. There are different views.}

> 'Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.'

\

<!-- \pause -->

> 'Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.' Alfred Marshall

<aside class="notes">The first quote suggests an *approach*, the second suggests a *domain*.</aside>
<aside class="notes">'Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.' Ludwig von Mises</aside>
 <aside class="notes">Asked two economists and will probably get at least three answers</aside>

----

### What is Microeconomics?


\


The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets.

<!-- . . . -->


\

<br> \bigskip

Largely, using theoretical and mathematical 'models' that depend on strong assumptions.


<aside class="notes">Give some examples of economic choices: Consumer purchases, investments, life and family choices, taking a job,

starting a firm, entering a market, producing a product (type, quality, inputs), pricing it...</aside>

<center>
<big> Models are general, and can be applied to many contexts; deep meanings </big> </center>

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/karl_pilkington_by_kevandre-d8z0zzh.png")
```

<aside class="notes">Are models 'fully realistic'? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications.

 A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and 'general';

 some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed.

 But even these more general models are simplifications</aside>



#  So why learn these models?

What do models give us?

<br> \bigskip

*`r format_with_col("There are different views of this","blue")`*

<br> \bigskip

<!-- . . . -->


Assumptions $\rightarrow$ Results \


<!-- . . . -->

and sometimes $\rightarrow$ testable predictions (if the assumptions hold)

<br> \bigskip

<aside class="notes">Adv: You can critique only the assumptions;

the results are logically/mathematically proven

  although when the results contradict real-world evidence this hints that the assumptions may be substantially wrong.

Do these simplified models yield conclusions that are relevant to the more complicated real world?

Maybe, and sometimes. We will consider the evidence </aside>


----


**So why learn these models?**

- A starting point

- (Sometimes) make testable concrete predictions

- Building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking


<!-- \pause -->

- Discussion is framed around them; seen as a 'baseline'

- Understand the models to effectively critique or extend them



<aside class="notes">Some critics of 'neoliberal economics' can be misinformed about what it is.

Their criticism sounds to us like someone who says 'cars are dangerous and should be banned

 because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping'</aside>


----

**Differing views** on the use of economic models

*Instrumentalist:*


The Methodology of Positive Economics (Friedman): the ultimate goal of theory is to "yield valid and meaningful ... predictions about phenomena not yet observed"

----

<!-- . . . -->


'Fictionalist' (Sugden):

> describes a fictional world that is credible or truthlike in something like the way that the events of a realistic novel are;
> the model connects with the real world by relations of similarity



----

Are these models predictive?

<br> \bigskip

If not, are they useful?

<aside class="notes">Reasons to model optimising behavior if it is not predictive.

 But good evidence for optimisation and 'predictable irrationality' ... behavioural economics.</aside>

<aside class="notes">
-e.g., :
    - psychological costs/benefits relating to *outcomes other than their own final consumption.*

    - They may care about others' consumption (altruism etc.),

    - about the way they *make* the decision,

    - and about how close they come to certain goals ('reference points' and 'loss aversion').

    -  may realize their  short-term choices are not in their lt interest, and try to constrain themselves

    - mentally costly to carefully calculate the costs and benefits $\rightarrow$  'rational inattention'

    -follow simple rules or 'heuristics' to make their decisions easier; e.g., 'work every day until I've earned  target income'.

# Does (elite) higher education increase (individual) income/social welfare? Do the gains outweigh the (opportunity) costs?

<small> Application 1.2 in NS text. Handout: some articles discussing this. Read at home, discuss </small>

<aside class="notes">

The answer to this question depends on Microeconomic concepts such as

- Returns to labour inputs in (competitive?) markets; human capital

- The role of skilled labor in the production function

- Asymmetric information over employee 'type' and 'signaling'

- Intertemporal substitution of consumption and 'discount rates'

Even framing the question requires microeconomics.

Consider: Social vs private returns. Is there a case for 'market failure' in the provision of education?

- Who gains and who suffers with a government-imposed price floor/ceiling?

<aside class="notes">
To economists, a 'shortage' is where, at the prevailing or imposed price,

consumers are willing to buy more than is available.

Some consumers get value from the good in excess of the price.

They might offer a higher price, or sellers might ask for a higher price.

The price rise would reduce quantity demanded (not 'reduce demand')

 and increase quantity supplied (not 'reduce supply').

<!---
## How Economists 'Verify' (or Assess) Theoretical Models
Two methods:
1. Testing Assumptions
<aside class="notes">'Verifying' economic models by examining validity of assumptions upon which models are based.
  Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.? DR: 'Verifying' is a bit too black and white'; all models have limitations.</aside>
<aside class="notes">Adv: The text is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions.
 However, there are many cases in which the *predictions* of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms. \textCR
On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as 'constant relative risk aversion' or 'geometric discounting' can be very credibly tested.
 We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure 'how close' behavior is to the assumption.</aside>
2. Testing Predictions
<aside class="notes">Verifying economic models by asking whether models can accurately predict real-world events.
 If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid. \textCR
DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general.
</aside>
## Positive and normative
*What's the difference between the following two statements?*
1.  "An increase in the minimum wage leads to greater unemployment."
<aside class="notes">Adv: Previous slides had: 'We should increase the minimum wage to help low income workers.'
 Why do I think this is not a good parallel?</aside>
2. 'We should reduce the minimum wage, to lessen unemployment'
- The first is a *positive* statement: it looks at 'what is'
- The second is a *normative* statement: it looks at  'what should be'
<aside class="notes">We will mainly focus on *positive* statements.

 However, you are not forbidden from making normative statements,

 and *positive* results are useful in making *normative* judgements.

 But we should try to be clear which type of statement we are making.

 Still, much economic research has both positive and normative interpretations and implications.

 Some economists work on ways of clearly defining and quantifying preferences over social outcomes.

 Others work on determining determining 'how to optimise', with implications for which policies and decisions

 (for individuals, firms, governments, and nonprofits) will be most efficient and effective at attaining particular goals.</aside>

A *very* good resource -- Khan academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/

- E.g., see their Introduction to differential calculus


##Simple stuff


(Univariate) Function
:     A 'map' from one or more *variables* $x$ to an outcome $y=f(x)$

- for each value of $x$ the function tells you a single value of $f(x)$; typically we assign $y=f(x)$

\

<aside class="notes">'Variables' are more formally called the 'arguments' of a function </aside>
<aside class="notes">LC: Put up and plot the function $f(x)=-10 +3x$ here.

e.g., if I fish for x hours in a day, how much money do I earn (consider a 10 pound license fee)</aside>


----

\

Linear function
:     A function of the form $y=a+bX$; e.g., $y = f(x) = -10 + 3x$

- Plotted as a straight line; intercept $a$, constant slope $b$

<aside class="notes">Adv, Maths: For linear functions $f(a X_1 + b X_2) = a f(X_1) + b f(X_2) $ for any values of $a$, $b$, $X_1$, and $X_2$

In particular 'the function of the average is the average of the functions'.

This does *not* hold in general for nonlinear functions</aside>


----


Slope of $y = f(x)$
:      The change in y for a given change in x.  'Rise over run' $(\Delta y / \Delta x)$.


<br> \bigskip

<!-- \pause -->

- Arc slope, point slopes

<aside class="notes">Arc slope is the slope over a range.

Point slope: slope of the tangent to a curve at a point

For linear functions these are the same</aside>

----

Nonlinear (univariate) function
            : A function $f(x)$ of a form other than $f(x) = y=a+bX$;


<!-- . . . -->


- E.g., a quadratic function $y = f(x) = a + bx + cx^2$
    - E,g, $y = f(x) = 10 - 2x + 3x^2$
- Or a logarithmic $y=ln(x)$ or exponential function $y = exp(x)$

<aside class="notes">I will try to limit things to linear and quadratic functions, and possibly exponential and log function</aside>
<aside class="notes">I will remind you of the rules for dealing with these whenever it is necessary.</aside>


----


For linear functions the slope is the same at any point. For nonlinear functions it may differ at each point.

Instantaneous rate of change (instantaneous slope)
:    The slope of the line *tangent* to the curve at a single point

<aside class="notes">Adv, Math: This is the limit of the 'rise over run' as the run goes to zero</aside>


<!-- . . . -->


- Convex function: Slope everywhere increasing, unique minimum where slope $=0$
- Concave function: Slope everywhere decreasing, unique *maximum* where slope $=0$

<aside class="notes">Quadratics are convex if the squared term has a positive sign ... dominates at large x</aside>


<aside class="notes">We will mainly deal with functions like these,

 with a single minimum or maximum that occurs at the unique point with slope zero. </aside>

<aside class="notes">Ex convex: Tiger's golf earnings per game as function of hours of golf retraining

Or cost per smoothie as function of employees behind smoothie counter.

Ex concave: how funny I am as function of beers I drink</aside>


----

Derivative of a function
:     A *derivative* of a function $f(x)$ is another function called $f'(x)$.
$f'(x)$ tells us the (point) *slope* of the function $f(x)$ at any point $x$.


<!-- . . . -->


- For example, the derivative of the function $f(x) = 2x + 3$ is $f'(x) = 2$
    - For this linear function the slope is a constant, 2

----

- E.g., the derivative of the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1$ is $f'(x) = 2x - 4$

<br> \bigskip

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

----

- derivative of the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1$ is $f'(x) = 2x - 4$

 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/plotaquadfncn_andderiv.png")
```



<!-- . . . -->


- E.g., the slope at $x=1$ is $f'(x;x=1) = 1*1 - 4 = -2

- The slope is zero where $f'(x)=2x-4=0$, or where $x=2$

    - *Is $x=2$ at a min, a max, or neither? How do we know?*

 You don't have to memorise the rules for this module; I will always tell you the derivative when you might need it.</aside>
<aside class="notes">LC: Plot 'slope of function' with same X-axis as function itself</aside>


## Minimum, maximum, or neither?

- $f'(x)$ is a function that tells us the slope of $f(x)$, or how $f(x)$ changes in $x$ at any point $x$
- In turn, the derivative of $f'(x)$ is called $f''(x)$.
    - Tells us how the *slope* changes as $x$ increases

Oversimplifying:

<aside class="notes">Adv, Math: Essentially, for a class of functions where the domain is not bounded</aside>

## Functions of two or more variables (multivariate functions)

Utility, profit, cost, production, returns, etc.

- May depend on multiple variables/inputs
- Need to illustrate tradeoffs between these


<!-- . . . -->

$$y=f(x,z)$$

- $y$ may increase and/or decrease in $x$ and in $z$,

- The rate of increase of y in $x$ may depend on the values of $x$ and $z$

     - Similar for the rate of increase of y in z


<!-- . . . -->

E.g., $$y=\sqrt(xz) = x^{1/2}z^{1/2}, x \geq 0, z \geq 0$$

## Contour lines (we will come back to this later!)

Contour lines
:     Level sets - depict combinations of variables that hold the function constant at a particular value
:     f(x,z) = A for some value $A$

Level sets: *E.g., indifference curves*, *isoquants* and *isocost* curves.

- $W$:  an external or *exogenous* variable that increases the quantity demanded (at any price)

<aside class="notes">E.g., the amount of a windfall tax rebate, boosting net income</aside>

- $Z$:  an *exogenous* variable that makes production more costly
<aside class="notes">increasing the price firms require to supply a particular quantity</aside>
<aside class="notes">E.g., the level of the minimum wage, or e.g., energy prices</aside>

\

<!-- . . . -->

Now write the supply/demand model as:
$$Q=-P+W$$
$$P=Q+Z$$

- P and Q are *endogenous* variables, so don't ask 'how does P change in Q?'
- W and Z are *exogenous* variables
    - If we know W and Z we can solve for the equilibrium Q and P
    - 'Comparative statics': how equilibrium responds to shifts in W \& Z

## Application 1A.3: ... Changing world oil prices (time-permitting)

<aside class="notes">This is a great example from perhaps the most important global market, with tremendous fluctuations that have huge impacts.

 It shows the power of empirical microeconomics.</aside>

$$ Q = 85 - 0.4P \: (D) $$
$$ Q = 55 + 0.6P \: (S) $$

Solving: $85 - 0.4P=55+0.6P \rightarrow P = 30, Q = 73$

*Why did price rise to US\$130 in 2008 and fall to \$50 by March '09?*

<!-- . . . -->

- China \& India's economies grew $\rightarrow$ growth in the world economy by 3-4\% per year
    - (Various calculations) $\rightarrow$ Demand shifts out from  $Q_D = 85 - 0.4P$ to:

<aside class="notes">I think the 'new demand' curve comes from an approximation:

if the world economy grew at 4\% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it's previous size. ... thus the growth is $1.047^7=1.316$.

They assume oil's demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112.

Note that the NS text has a typo: equation 3 on page 40, the new demand, should read $Q=112-0.4P$.</aside>

$$Q_D = 112 - 0.4P$$
$$Q_S = 55 + 0.6P$$


$\rightarrow$ solves to $P=57, Q=87$

I.  Plotting supply and demand "for orange juice", solving, for equilibrium price, excess demand/supply at non-equilibrium prices

<aside class="notes">In the real world, you might collect data like this and want to 'fit a line' to it.

But it will never such a precise fit (you will fit a 'regression line' to minimise the deviations), and the 'all else equal' assumption is always an issue.</aside>
