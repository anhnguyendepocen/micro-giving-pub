## Game Theory - coverage

NS: chapter 5 (nearly all of it, see web book)


- `r format_with_col("Additional to text: Dominance, rationalizability","gray")`

- Experimental evidence (and evidence from the real world); supplemental readings


... Problem set coming, heavy coverage of game theory!





----

*Module context*

1. Basic tools, the economic approach

2. The simple classical model, welfare results


. . .


3. Market failures (Monopoly, Public Goods)


. . .


4. Extensions of simple model: 'Die roll' Uncertainty


$\rightarrow$  and now *Strategic* uncertainty $\rightarrow$ **Game Theory**

<aside class="notes">Finally, behavioural economics</aside>

## Basic concepts (strategic interaction, elements of a game)

`r format_with_col("Previously","brown")`: Each individual (consumer, firm... ) takes others' choices as *given*

- market price, demand curve, etc.


. . .


\

`r format_with_col("Now:","brown")` Consider *strategic interaction*



. . .


My best choice may *depend* on your choice,  \& vice versa


. . .

\


- Sequential games: My earlier choices may change your later choices

----

**One minute exercise**

<br> \bigskip

*Find a situation*---in business, government, fiction, history or your own life---

... where one party's optimal choice depends on what *another* party does.


. . .


<br> \bigskip

*Write it down*, `r format_with_col("give 1-sentence explanation of why it involves 'strategic dependence'","gray")`

**Some possible examples:**


- Ask out your crush or not?


. . .


- Country makes war or peace? Soldiers fight or run away?

\

- Run for office or not? Party contests a seat? If so, how much to spend on campaign?


. . .


\

- Amount to bid at a first-price auction?

- Whether Robotic Chef opens a new branch in Exeter, and where?

- How hard to work towards a promotion at your job?

<aside class="notes">   David: Overrated as a tool to predict how people/firms will  behave; see notes

<small>
Often makes multiple predictions, or predicts 'mixed strategies' (randomisation).

Real-world \& experimental choices often predicted poorly by classical GT.

E.g., stdd game theory says chess is boring, has a pre-determined outcome.

Adv: But note complicating issues make it difficult to asses predictions of GT

...  monetary payoff may not be the same as utility payoffs; makes prediction unclear

Esp. with social/fairness preferences or fairness preferences.

We also see failures to coordinate, failure to take higher-order cognitive steps

And preferences over the *manner decisions are made*.

Nash equilibrium (NE)
:     A set ('profile') of *strategies*, one for each player, that are best responses against one another


If I play my BR to your chosen strategy and you're playing your BR to mine, neither of us has an incentive to deviate --- an equilibrium.

All games have at least one Nash equilibrium

Caveat: we might not expect such play to actually occur (particularly not in one-shot games)

If eliminating dominated strategies yields a single prediction for each player, these form a NE (profile).

I.e., $2h > 1- h$, i.e, $h > 1/3$

### What's all this rot?


. . .



Mixed strategies are not about 'being unpredictable'; these are one shot games

<aside class="notes">
Adv: Some texts and authors make this point about 'unpredictability' but others disagree (including myself).
Making sure that it is impossible to predict your later play from your previous is only important if you are playing the same game repeatedly, and being observed.
</aside>

. . .


It makes a bit more sense if we think about 'populations'

. . .


- Suppose in a population 1/3 of men go to Ballet and 2/3 of women go to Ballet:
- ... these ratios are 'stable'; no reason for systematic changes.


. . .


- On the other hand, if men always went to boxing and women to ballet this is not stable
- A husband would be better off going to ballet ... so the ratios should change over time.


----

###Computing payoffs with mixing

Formally NE specifies *strategies* (strategy 'profiles') not payoffs

\


. . .


\


In the BOS the pure strategy equilibria were

- i. Husband: Boxing, Wife: Boxing
- ii. Husband: Ballet, Wife: Ballet

. . .

\


The mixed-strategy NE was:

- iii. Husband: go Ballet with probability h=1/3, Wife: Go Ballet with prob w=2/3.


. . .

\


The *payoffs* to these were, respectively

- i. Husband: 2, Wife: 1
- ii. Husband: 1, Wife: 2
- iii. ...

----

Payoff to the mixed strategy: simple EU computations, see handout (work on your own)

<!---
- Payoffs are utilities, sum utility of each outcome $\times$ probability of that outcome
    - Prob(Both go Ballet) = $w \times h = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$
    - Prob(Both go Boxing) = $(1-w)(1-h) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$
    - Prob(Wife Ballet, Husband Boxing) = $w(1-h) = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{9}$
    - Prob(Wife Boxing, Husband Ballet) = $(1-w)(h) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$
    -->


<!---
Thus, under the mixed strategy NE play:
$$U_{husb} =  \frac{2}{9} \times 1 +  \frac{2}{9} \times 2 +  \frac{4}{9} \times 0 + \frac{1}{9} \times 0 = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$$
$$U_{wife} = \frac{2}{3}$$
<br> \bigskip
`r format_with_col("Wife's payoff inferred from symmetry of problem or similarly calculated","gray")`
-->

It turns out:

$$U_{husb} =  \frac{2}{9} \times 1 +  \frac{2}{9} \times 2 +  \frac{4}{9} \times 0 + \frac{1}{9} \times 0 = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$$

and same for the Wife's payoffs.

### How do you solve a problem like multiple-equilibria? (WIP)


[LINK](https://youtu.be/OvsNgQS_Qa8?t=40)

There's always one or more they say but sometimes it is mixed \
you find one where the best responses meet at some point fixed \
you only know you won't regret the strategies it 'picksed' \
I hear that it's prediction power is shabby

\

It might not yield the best outcome and might not yield the worst \
In prisoner's dillemas a confession is coerced, \
I hate to have to say it, but I very firmly feel Nash Equilibrium's not an asset to the abbey \

I have to say a word on its behalf: multiple-equilibria make me laugh

## So,

How do you solve a problem like multiple-equilibria?

- How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
    - How do choose among the multiple-equilibria?
    - A flibbertjibbet! A will-o'-the wisp! A clown!


Many a thing you'd like old Nash to tell you \
Many a thing you thought you'd understand \
But how do you find a way to predict equilibrium play? \
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

Oh, how do you solve a problem like multiple-equilibria? \
*How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?*

# Multiple equilibrium and refinements

## Multiple equilibrium and refinements

We refer to *refinement criteria* and *focal points*

- Equilibrium with the highest payoffs for both?
    - In BOS this rules out mixing (payoffs 2/3, 2/3 for h,w respectively)
    - But doesn't say whether it's Box, Box (payoffs 2,1) or Ballet, Ballet (payoffs 1,2)

. . .


- Choose the 'symmetric equilibrium?' ... here, mixing


. . .


- Choose the one that seems like a 'focal point'? (rem, the 'big game')

- Definite horizon: play stage game a *known* and finite number of times

## A general rule for (finitely) repeated games

Is there a way in which we can sustain cooperation in a finitely repeated Prisoners' Dilemma?


. . .


<br> \bigskip


No.

<aside class="notes">PUT THE PAYOFFS on the board</aside>


----

Suppose we repeat the Prisoners' Dilemma a finite (T) number of times, e.g., 10 times.

. . .


What is the subgame perfect equilibrium?


. . .


\


**Backwards induction:**

- In period 10 (period T) both confess as it's the dominant strategy

. . .


- In period 9 (period T-1)
    - Knowing period 10 (period T) decision is unaffected by earlier moves, players confess in period 9 (their dominant strategy)


. . .


- ... etc, all the way back to period 1


. . .


Thus each Confesses in every period $\rightarrow$ Can't sustain cooperation.


# Repeated Games: Indefinite or infinite time horizon (mathematically equivalent)

- Game played repeatedly for potentially infinite number of periods


. . .


- But there is a 'discount factor' $g$


. . .


- $g$ may instead represent 'probability the game is repeated another time'

<aside class="notes">With an infinitely-repeated game with no discounting, payoffs would be potentially infinite, making it hard to decipher.

 It's realistic to imagine people discount the future, and we don't know how long these repeated interactions last; people die, move away, etc.</aside>

### Trigger strategies

Trigger strategy
:     Strategy in a repeated game where one player stops cooperating in order to punish another player for not cooperating.


. . .


<br> \bigskip


Grim trigger strategy
:     If other player fails to cooperate in one period, play the (undominated) strategy that makes the other player worst off in all later periods

----


**Indefinitely repeated Prisoners' Dilemma**

Consider the following trigger strategy (for both players):

- Stay silent as long as the other player stays silent.
- If one player confesses, both players will confess from them on.


. . .


Is this a SPNE?


. . .


- In each subgame after someone confesses, we play confess in all stage games (forever on), which we know is a NE

. . .


- What about periods where no one has confessed (yet)?

<aside class="notes">How do we know both players playing 'confess forever' is a SPNE?

Starting in any subgame,  knowing the other player will confess, I will want to confess (for that period's payoffs).

I also know that given his strategy, playing 'silent' in  this period will not have any impact on my later payoffs.</aside>








<aside class="notes">Know the principle as well as  the computation if possible.

 **geometric discounting** is super-relevant for finance and cost-benefit analysis

and it also will come up in behavioral economics.</aside>







----


The payoff from staying Silent (cooperating) each period is:

$$-2 \times (1 + g + g^2 + g^3 + . . . )$$

. . .


The payoff from Confessing right away (after which both players Confess always) is:

$$ -1 + -3 \times (g + g^2 + g^3 + . . . ) $$

. . .

Formula for a geometric series (where $0<g<1$): $g + g^2 +  g^3 + g^4 ... = g/(1-g)$



<aside class="notes">Maths: The standard derivation of this, which is pretty neat, is in the NS text.

This formula is an important one in economics (and beyond),

 particularly for discounting a constant stream of payoffs, e.g., stock dividends</aside>

----

Thus cooperation in a single period is 'weakly preferred' (at least as good) if


$$(-2) \times (1 + g + g^2 + g^3 + . . . ) \geq (-1) + -3 \times (g + g^2 + g^3 + . . .)$$

. . .

$$g + g^2 + g^3 + . . . \geq 1$$

<aside class="notes">Intuition for the second formula: left side is loss of future payoffs (-3 vs -2 forever from next period).

 Right side is gain in that period (get -1 rather than -2))</aside>

. . .

$$g/(1-g) \geq 1$$

. . .

$$g \geq \frac{1}{2}$$


. . .


$\rightarrow$  cooperation can be sustained if the 'probability of play continuing' (or 'patience')  is high enough; here, above 1/2.

<aside class="notes">Just because it can be sustained doesn't mean it will; there are other Subgame-Perfect Nash equilibria, including 'always confess'.</aside>

- Shepherd B: $s_B(120-s_A-s_B)$

. . .


\


*Marginal* benefit of 'me adding' another sheep:

- Shepherd A: $120-2s_A-s_B$
- Shepherd B: $120-s_A-2s_B$


<aside class="notes">BEEM101: covered in tutorial</aside>


----

For simplicity, assume zero marginal cost

\

Set MB=MC (here MC=0)

- Shepherd A: $120-2s_A-s_B = 0$
- Shepherd B: $120-s_A-2s_B = 0$


. . .

Rearrange above to solve for BRFs:

- Shepherd A:  $s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$
- Shepherd B:  $s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A$

$$s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$$

Plug this value of $s_A$ into the BRF for B, solve for $s_B$, then for $s_A$

$$s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A = 60 - \frac{1}{2}(60-\frac{1}{2} s_B)$$

. . .


Above, $s_A* = s_B* = 40$. Each get payoff $40 \times (120 - 40 - 40) = 40 \times 40 = 1600$

. . .

<small>To max *total* payoffs, set</small> $S=s_A+s_B$ <small> to max </small>

- Measure preferences (risk, time, social preferences...)

. . .


- Asses theoretical predictions (classical and behavioural), including game theory
    - Also see 'likely' outcomes where theory has no prediction or predicts multiple equilibria
    - *Critical* to assert 'control' over payoffs for this

. . .


- Understand cognitive processes in economic realm


. . .


- 'Test' institutions and mechanisms (e.g., auctions, markets)

## Laboratory evidence 1: Prisoners' dilemmas

Cooper et al (1996)

<small>Cooperation even in anonymous '1-shot' games (different opponents each time)</small>


. . .


<small>Cooperation declines somewhat over time, but not to zero</small>

. . .


<small>Mix of other-regarding and selfish types</small>

<aside class="notes">Results are similar for experiments involving contributions to public goods.

-   some cooperation, declining over time but not to zero, and a mix of players who never contribute and many 'reciprocal' types. We may return to this later in the module.</aside>

## Laboratory evidence 2: Ultimatum game

Proposer goes first, proposes split of the 'pie', anything between 0\%-100\% and 100\%-0\% inclusive.

. . .


Responder can accept, or reject and get nothing

<aside class="notes">Q: What does SPNE predict (use backwards induction)?</aside>

<aside class="notes">Ans: It predicts the proposal offers the lowest (positive) amount and the responder accepts</aside>


. . .


What happens in experiments?


. . .


- Most common offer: 50-50 split
- Responders: Often reject offers of less than 30\% (even when it's a lot of money)


. . .


Potential explanations

- Fairness concerns; monetary payoffs may not be *actual* payoffs

. . .

- Proposers may anticipate this



## Issues in lab experiments

### What is being measured?

PD: Does money measure the true payoffs? Do we have the 'control' to test the model?

. . .


- Other-regarding preferences; may be unobservable.
- 'Experimenter demand': desire to please experimenter, aware of study goals?


## Issues in lab experiments: External generalisability

1. Relevance of subject-pool (participants)

- Do they resemble the 'real world' group of interest? (e.g., firms, countries, taxpayers, voters, home-buyers)

- Right preferences and experience?


. . .


2. Relevance of environment

- Are the (small) stakes relevant?

- Are the right 'environmental characteristics' present?


. . .


- Does the 'imposed model' apply?

- Observed self-conscious environment, perhaps made aware of contrasts

**Additional tutorial problem I (Game theory)**
```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/teenchoices.png")
```
<small>Teens A and B are smitten with each other but neither knows of the other's feelings. Suppose the teachers at their school organize a dance.  The 'payoff' is based on whether their advances are rebuffed or accepted.  If they both Declare,  they get positive utility but if they are Rebuffed they face humiliation (significantly negative payoff).  Rebuffing an advance slightly elevates the teen's standing with peers.</small>

- What is a teen's dominant strategy, or is there no dominant strategy?
- Find the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium or equilibria
- Find the mixed strategy equilibrium
**Additional tutorial problem II (Game theory)**
```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/isd4by3game.png")
```
- Apply 'Iterated strict dominance' to the above game, showing your steps
- State the pure strategies that are rationalizable.
** Additional tutorial problem III (Game theory)**
```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/entrygame.png")
```
- Use backwards-induction to find the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium strategies, outcomes, and payoffs, of the above game.
