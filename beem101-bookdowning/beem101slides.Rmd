**Enrichment texts**

*Have a look at in case you are thinking of going for a PhD in economics or taking further coursework at the MRes level*

1. Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extension (also by Nicholson and Snyder): more maths and extensions

<aside class="notes">is similar to our text, but with more maths and formalism, and some extensions (but fewer applications)</aside>

2. David Autor's MIT Open Courseware "Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy": More rigorous, close to PhD level, includes good research applications


3. PhD level: Jehle and Reny's "Advanced Microeconomic Theory", or  Hal Varian's text "Microeconomic Analysis"; Mas-Colell et al for wizards only

<aside class="notes">You will have seen many of these concepts before.

But do you really understand them well enough to *explain* them to a non-economicst

##The real big question: why are you here?

\framedgraphic{galaxy.jpg}


----

**Why are you here (in this lecture theatre)?**

To learn.


<!-- \pause -->

- Because you think it's interesting

    - to ponder big questions about individuals, markets, society

    - to understand how people have tried to bring order to difficult questions

    - because you want to contribute something to the world


<!-- \pause -->

- Because this stuff is actually useful in the real world

    - For your professional and/or academic career

    - For your life

##But anything I say you can find online, or in a book, so why are you here?


<!-- \pause -->

To interact

<br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("Not to hear what the *lecturer","brown")` has to say, but for the lecturer to respond to what \emph{you* say.}

<aside class="notes">Because you can interact with me, ask me questions, come up with ideas, work with other students

 Impress me and get a good letter of reference.

 I advise everyone to come to my OH at least once</aside>

##How to do well

1. Put in the work

- Read in advance, bring questions (can we flip?)

<aside class="notes">This is a somewhat 'flipped teaching' module!</aside>

<aside class="notes">Handouts and lectures mainly follow the text</aside>


<!-- \pause -->

- Do problem sets, suggested questions, understand the answers


<!-- \pause -->

<br> \bigskip

2. Care about the *content*


<aside class="notes">Care about *actually* understanding this stuff and relating it to the real world. This will be rewarded.

Real understanding: be able to explain this stuff in your own words and apply it to new situations

</aside>

<!-- \pause -->

<br> \bigskip

3. Interact and discuss: Peers, Forum, office hours

4. Be careful you know how to interpret the exam instructions correctly, and use your time wisely

<aside class="notes">The last comment is especially relevant for non-native speakers of English</aside>

## Chapter 1:  Economic Models

### What is Economics?

\

\note{DR: It has changed. There are different views.}

> 'Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses.'

\

<!-- \pause -->

> 'Economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.' Alfred Marshall

<aside class="notes">The first quote suggests an *approach*, the second suggests a *domain*.</aside>
<aside class="notes">'Economics never tells a man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends.' Ludwig von Mises</aside>
 <aside class="notes">Asked two economists and will probably get at least three answers</aside>

----

### What is Microeconomics?


\


The study of the (economic) choices individuals and firms make and how these choices create markets.

. . .


\

<br> \bigskip

Largely, using theoretical and mathematical 'models' that depend on strong assumptions.


<aside class="notes">Give some examples of economic choices: Consumer purchases, investments, life and family choices, taking a job,

starting a firm, entering a market, producing a product (type, quality, inputs), pricing it...</aside>

----

\textrm{\huge Models are general, and can be applied to many contexts; deep meanings}

----

\

<br> \bigskip

\textrm{\huge Humans are not like billiard balls, universal rules are hard to come by}

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("karl_pilkington_by_kevandre-d8z0zzh.png")
```

<aside class="notes">Are models 'fully realistic'? No. They are models, i.e., simplifications.

 A huge body of work has gone into making these models more complex and 'general';

 some of the conclusions are preserved, others are weakened or reversed.

 But even these more general models are simplifications</aside>





## So why learn these models?

**The tortoise and the hare**

\medskip

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("tortoisehare.jpg")
```

. . .

\footnotesize

- Can hares really speak?

- Is this a rabbit or a hare?

- What other animals were racing?

<aside class="notes">'Ceteris Paribus' helps us understand why these fables can be helpful</aside>

----


What do models give us?

<br> \bigskip

*`r format_with_col("There are different views of this","blue")`*

<br> \bigskip

. . .


Assumptions $\rightarrow$ Results \


. . .

and sometimes $\rightarrow$ testable predictions (if the assumptions hold)

<br> \bigskip

<aside class="notes">Adv: You can critique only the assumptions;

the results are logically/mathematically proven

  although when the results contradict real-world evidence this hints that the assumptions may be substantially wrong.

Do these simplified models yield conclusions that are relevant to the more complicated real world?

Maybe, and sometimes. We will consider the evidence </aside>


----


**So why learn these models?**

- A starting point

- (Sometimes) make testable concrete predictions

- Building insight, clear arguments, a way of thinking


<!-- \pause -->

- Discussion is framed around them; seen as a 'baseline'

- Understand the models to effectively critique or extend them



<aside class="notes">Some critics of 'neoliberal economics' can be misinformed about what it is.

Their criticism sounds to us like someone who says 'cars are dangerous and should be banned

 because they go too fast and have no mechanism for stopping'</aside>

 [comment]: <> (101BB)

----

**Differing views** on the use of economic models

*Instrumentalist:*


The Methodology of Positive Economics (Friedman): the ultimate goal of theory is to "yield valid and meaningful ... predictions about phenomena not yet observed"



. . .


'Fictionalist' (Sugden):

> describes a fictional world that is credible or truthlike in something like the way that the events of a realistic novel are;
> the model connects with the real world by relations of similarity



----

Are these models predictive?

<br> \bigskip

If not, are they useful?

<aside class="notes">Reasons to model optimising behavior if it is not predictive.

 But good evidence for optimisation and 'predictable irrationality' ... behavioural economics.</aside>

<aside class="notes">

    - psychological costs/benefits relating to *outcomes other than their own final consumption.*

## Marshall’s Model of Supply and Demand


Argued price must equal both the value (to consumers) *and* the cost (to produce) of the last unit produced and consumed

<br> \bigskip

<aside class="notes">Needed to explain falling prices in the 19th century, while quantities were increasing</aside>

Introduced the 'demand curve';  *with a downward slope*  -- because:


. . .



'Satiation' (later units valued less) and catering to less keen consumers


<aside class="notes">Wtp less and less for the next unit purchased, so will buy more only at a lower price.</aside>
<aside class="notes">Equivalently, at a lower price more people find the value exceeds the price, and for additional units</aside>

<aside class="notes">So *don't* ask 'how does the price affect the quantity exchanged'?</aside>

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

. . .


With 'single crossing' there is a unique price where $Q_s(p)=Q_d(p)$

<br> \bigskip


. . .


and a unique quantity where the last unit's value to the consumer equals it's cost to produce.


----

*Draw: the famous Marshallian cross*

*Can you explain?*


- The inefficiency of any price other than where $Q^D(p)=Q^S(p)$?

- If the price was set at a different value, what forces might push it to the equilibrium?



<aside class="notes">
To economists, a 'shortage' is where, at the prevailing or imposed price,

consumers are willing to buy more than is available.

Some consumers get value from the good in excess of the price.

They might offer a higher price, or sellers might ask for a higher price.

The price rise would reduce quantity demanded (not 'reduce demand')

 and increase quantity supplied (not 'reduce supply').

## How Economists 'Verify' (or Assess) Theoretical Models
Two methods:
1. Testing Assumptions
<aside class="notes">'Verifying' economic models by examining validity of assumptions upon which models are based.
  Is it reasonable to assume that people are rational, that firms maximize profits etc.? DR: 'Verifying' is a bit too black and white'; all models have limitations.</aside>
<aside class="notes">Adv: The text is somewhat dismissive of the idea of testing assumptions.
 However, there are many cases in which the *predictions* of the models are very hard to test; e.g., the impact of a radical change in government policy or the merger of the two largest firms. \textCR
On the other hand, in many cases the key assumptions entering into models, such as 'constant relative risk aversion' or 'geometric discounting' can be very credibly tested.
 We can use existing micro data on thousands of household decisions, as well as experiments, to measure 'how close' behavior is to the assumption.</aside>
2. Testing Predictions
<aside class="notes">Verifying economic models by asking whether models can accurately predict real-world events.
 If the model predicts events well, then the theory is useful even if the assumption may not appear to be valid. \textCR
DR: But if the assumptions are substantially wrong, it may predict well in one particular case but not in general.
</aside>
## Positive and normative
*What's the difference between the following two statements?*
1.  "An increase in the minimum wage leads to greater unemployment."
<aside class="notes">Adv: Previous slides had: 'We should increase the minimum wage to help low income workers.'
 Why do I think this is not a good parallel?</aside>
2. 'We should reduce the minimum wage, to lessen unemployment'
- The first is a *positive* statement: it looks at 'what is'
- The second is a *normative* statement: it looks at  'what should be'
<aside class="notes">We will mainly focus on *positive* statements.

 However, you are not forbidden from making normative statements,

 and *positive* results are useful in making *normative* judgements.

 But we should try to be clear which type of statement we are making.

 Still, much economic research has both positive and normative interpretations and implications.

 Some economists work on ways of clearly defining and quantifying preferences over social outcomes.

 Others work on determining determining 'how to optimise', with implications for which policies and decisions

 (for individuals, firms, governments, and nonprofits) will be most efficient and effective at attaining particular goals.</aside>

##Simple stuff


(Univariate) Function
:     A 'map' from one or more *variables* $x$ to an outcome $y=f(x)$

- for each value of $x$ the function tells you a single value of $f(x)$; typically we assign $y=f(x)$

\

<aside class="notes">'Variables' are more formally called the 'arguments' of a function </aside>
<aside class="notes">LC: Put up and plot the function $f(x)=-10 +3x$ here.

e.g., if I fish for x hours in a day, how much money do I earn (consider a 10 pound license fee)</aside>


----

\

Linear function
:     A function of the form $y=a+bX$; e.g., $y = f(x) = -10 + 3x$

- Plotted as a straight line; intercept $a$, constant slope $b$

<aside class="notes">Adv, Maths: For linear functions $f(a X_1 + b X_2) = a f(X_1) + b f(X_2) $ for any values of $a$, $b$, $X_1$, and $X_2$

In particular 'the function of the average is the average of the functions'.

This does *not* hold in general for nonlinear functions</aside>


----


Slope of $y = f(x)$
:      The change in y for a given change in x.  'Rise over run' $(\Delta y / \Delta x)$.


<br> \bigskip

<!-- \pause -->

- Arc slope, point slopes

<aside class="notes">Arc slope is the slope over a range.

Point slope: slope of the tangent to a curve at a point

For linear functions these are the same</aside>

----

Nonlinear (univariate) function
            : A function $f(x)$ of a form other than $f(x) = y=a+bX$;


. . .


- E.g., a quadratic function $y = f(x) = a + bx + cx^2$
    - E,g, $y = f(x) = 10 - 2x + 3x^2$
- Or a logarithmic $y=ln(x)$ or exponential function $y = exp(x)$

<aside class="notes">I will try to limit things to linear and quadratic functions, and possibly exponential and log function</aside>
<aside class="notes">I will remind you of the rules for dealing with these whenever it is necessary.</aside>


----


\

For linear functions the slope is the same at any point. For nonlinear functions it may differ at each point.

Instantaneous rate of change (instantaneous slope)
:    The slope of the line *tangent* to the curve at a single point

<aside class="notes">Adv, Math: This is the limit of the 'rise over run' as the run goes to zero</aside>


. . .


- Convex function: Slope everywhere increasing, unique minimum where slope $=0$
- Concave function: Slope everywhere decreasing, unique *maximum* where slope $=0$

<aside class="notes">Quadratics are convex if the squared term has a positive sign ... dominates at large x</aside>


<aside class="notes">We will mainly deal with functions like these,

 with a single minimum or maximum that occurs at the unique point with slope zero. </aside>

<aside class="notes">Ex convex: Tiger's golf earnings per game as function of hours of golf retraining

Or cost per smoothie as function of employees behind smoothie counter.

Ex concave: how funny I am as function of beers I drink</aside>


----

Derivative of a function
:     A *derivative* of a function $f(x)$ is another function called $f'(x)$.
$f'(x)$ tells us the (point) *slope* of the function $f(x)$ at any point $x$.


. . .


- For example, the derivative of the function $f(x) = 2x + 3$ is $f'(x) = 2$
    - For this linear function the slope is a constant, 2

----

- E.g., the derivative of the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1$ is $f'(x) = 2x - 4$

<br> \bigskip

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

- derivative of the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 -4x + 1$ is $f'(x) = 2x - 4$


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("plotaquadfncn_andderiv.png")
```



. . .


- E.g., the slope at $x=1$ is $f'(x;x=1) = 1*1 - 4 = -2

- The slope is zero where $f'(x)=2x-4=0$, or where $x=2$

    - *Is $x=2$ at a min, a max, or neither? How do we know?*

 You don't have to memorise the rules for this module; I will always tell you the derivative when you might need it.</aside>
<aside class="notes">LC: Plot 'slope of function' with same X-axis as function itself</aside>


## Minimum, maximum, or neither?

- $f'(x)$ is a function that tells us the slope of $f(x)$, or how $f(x)$ changes in $x$ at any point $x$
- In turn, the derivative of $f'(x)$ is called $f''(x)$.
    - Tells us how the *slope* changes as $x$ increases

Oversimplifying:

<aside class="notes">Adv, Math: Essentially, for a class of functions where the domain is not bounded</aside>

## Functions of two or more variables (multivariate functions)

Utility, profit, cost, production, returns, etc.

- May depend on multiple variables/inputs
- Need to illustrate tradeoffs between these


. . .

$$y=f(x,z)$$

- $y$ may increase and/or decrease in $x$ and in $z$,

- The rate of increase of y in $x$ may depend on the values of $x$ and $z$

     - Similar for the rate of increase of y in z


. . .

E.g., $$y=\sqrt(xz) = x^{1/2}z^{1/2}, x \geq 0, z \geq 0$$

## Contour lines (we will come back to this later!)

Contour lines
:     Level sets - depict combinations of variables that hold the function constant at a particular value
:     f(x,z) = A for some value $A$

Level sets: *E.g., indifference curves*, *isoquants* and *isocost* curves.

and then plotting this against a range of L</aside>

## Exogenous and endogenous variables

<aside class="notes">This is a difficult concept</aside>

Suppose a model of supply and demand with 'exogenous shifters':

- $W$:  an external or *exogenous* variable that increases the quantity demanded (at any price)

<aside class="notes">E.g., the amount of a windfall tax rebate, boosting net income</aside>

- $Z$:  an *exogenous* variable that makes production more costly
<aside class="notes">increasing the price firms require to supply a particular quantity</aside>
<aside class="notes">E.g., the level of the minimum wage, or e.g., energy prices</aside>

\

. . .

Now write the supply/demand model as:
$$Q=-P+W$$
$$P=Q+Z$$

- P and Q are *endogenous* variables, so don't ask 'how does P change in Q?'
- W and Z are *exogenous* variables
    - If we know W and Z we can solve for the equilibrium Q and P
    - 'Comparative statics': how equilibrium responds to shifts in W \& Z

*Why did price rise to US\$130 in 2008 and fall to \$50 by March '09?*

. . .

- China \& India's economies grew $\rightarrow$ growth in the world economy by 3-4\% per year
    - (Various calculations) $\rightarrow$ Demand shifts out from  $Q_D = 85 - 0.4P$ to:

<aside class="notes">I think the 'new demand' curve comes from an approximation:

if the world economy grew at 4\% per year over seven years, each year it was 1.05 times it's previous size. ... thus the growth is $1.047^7=1.316$.

They assume oil's demand curve would shift out proportionally but have the same slope. 1.316*85 is about 112.

#Lecture2:  Utility and Choice [Chapter 2: 1-2 hours]


##Motivation

Consider a decision you recently made?

<br> \bigskip

- Define this decision clearly.

- How do you think you decided among these options?


<!-- \pause -->

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

<aside class="notes">What did this depend on? Would other people in your place have made the same decision?

If you got amnesia and forgot what you decided and then were in the same situation again. Do you think you'd make the same decision?</aside>

Suppose I asked you

'State a rule that governs (determines/characterizes) how people *do* make decisions'...

. . .

<br> \bigskip

I want this rule to be...

1. Informative (it rules *out* at least some sets of choices)

2. Predictive (people rarely if ever violate this rule)

----

Similar question:

'State a rule that governs how people *should* make decisions'..

 <br> \bigskip

By 'should' I mean that *they will not regret having made decisions in this way.*

<!-- \pause -->

2 minutes: discuss with your neighbour

----

\Huge If people *did* follow these rules, what would this imply and predict? \normalsize

<!-- \pause -->

Rules defined as 'axioms about preferences'

'Standard axioms'  $\rightarrow$ (imply that) choices can be expressed by 'individuals maximising *utility functions* subject to their *budget constraints*'


$\rightarrow$ yields predictions for individual behavior, markets, etc.

<aside class="notes">Economists and decision theorists have tried to come up with and defend such rules.

 They have started from these `reasonable axioms' and follow their logical implications for \textCR

##Utility

Utility
:     "The pleasure or satisfaction that people get from their economic activity."

. . .

<br> \bigskip

:     Alt: The thing that people maximise when making economic decisions

<aside class="notes">Adv: There is some debate about the meaning and interpretation of utility, particularly in the Behavioural Economics literature</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv: A defining feature of the standard Economics approach is that decisions are made as if all characteristics of outcomes can be compared and evaluated,

  thus we can reduce everything to a single dimension, 'utility', which is maximised</aside>

----

*How is this used?*

<br> \bigskip

. . .


Utility will be expressed as a single number that arises from the combination of all goods and services consumed.

. . .


<br> \bigskip


Essentially, economists assume that `when making a choice among all available and feasible options, an individual will choose the one that yields the greatest *utility*'


## Utility from two goods

$$Utility = U(X,Y; other)$$


\


. . .


- Leisure and 'goods consumption'
- Food and non-food
- Coffee and tea (holding all else constant)




## Measuring and comparing utilities

<aside class="notes">Adv: This is a difficult but well-studied issue, as it is important for methodology and welfare analysis.


 In more detailed discussions, we might speak of 'cardinal utility', 'ordinal utility', etc.,

 to indicate ways we can compare utility between individuals and in response to policy changes.</aside>

Utility is not 'observable and measurable in utils'

<!-- \pause -->

(Unlike midi-chlorians or thetans)


<br> \bigskip

<!-- \pause -->

Utility is seen to govern an individual's *choices* and thus it's only inferred indirectly, from the *choices* people make

----

**Revealed preference:** if Al buys a cat instead of a dog, and a dog was cheaper, we assume Al gets more utility from a cat


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("alscat.jpg")
```

*Interpersonal comparisons are difficult*


- Who gets 'more' utility?

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("facepalmstatue.jpg")
```

- Transfer from Al to Betty: Is the reduction in Al's utility more or less than the increase in Betty's?


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("babytakingfood.JPG")
```

<aside class="notes">As we only get at utility through an *individual's* decisions, we have no reliable way to compare it across individuals</aside>


[comment]: <> (101BB)

----

Standard utility functions are only 'identified' (only make distinct predictions) 'up to a monotonic transformation'

- i.e., a 'rank preserving' transformation.

-  E.g., multiply by a positive number, log, square, add/subtract from it;

    - the new utility function makes the same predictions; this is not helpful, because it means we cannot distinguish these empirically!


. . .


- The "benefit": we can transform (e.g., log) a utility function for convenient calculation


. . .

When we deal with uncertain choices, the 'Von Neumann - Morgenstern' utility functions will be somewhat more restrictive and thus better identified.

<aside class="notes">If you believe people obey those axioms and are thus EU maximisers</aside>

<aside class="notes">The Autor reading refers to Cardinal versus Ordinal utility.

 We use the latter in demand/consumer theory.</aside>

[comment]: <> (101EE)


## Standard assumptions about preferences ('axioms')



1. Completeness

<aside class="notes">Given two options, A and B, a person can state which option they prefer or whether they find both options equally attractive.</aside>

<aside class="notes">The more formal and parsimonious definition (Autor readings, Jehle/Reny) develop this from a single relation 'weakly preferred to'.</aside>

2. Transitivity (internal consistency)

<aside class="notes">If I prefer A to B, and prefer B to C, then I must prefer A to C.</aside>


3. More is Better (*nonsatiation*)


<aside class="notes">Completeness and transitivity (and continuity)  are necessary for people's choices to be represented by (continuous) *utility functions*

Continuity is necessary for 'well behaved' (not-jumpy) demand curves

(Local) Nonsatiation will help us derive results</aside>

<aside class="notes">2024, Adv, math: This slope will equal the negative of the *ratio* of the rate at which utility increases in each good (partial derivative).

### Preference for variety/balance

![Fig 2.3](indifcurvebalance.png) \

<aside class="notes">Adv: this 'preference for variety' is thought to hold for most combinations of goods, most of the time, but perhaps not for all pairings.

It tends to lead to easy-to-solve 'interior solutions' where people may consume some amount of each good, and have smooth reactions to price changes.

Extreme of this is 'necessity' goods. </aside>

<aside class="notes">LC: Adjust previous picture on visualiser/board</aside>

  any consumption bundle that represents a 'mixture' between two equally attractive extremes will be preferred to those extremes


E.g., if I like bundles A and D equally, I prefer a bundle of 1/3 of a and 2/3 of D to either A or D.</aside>

[comment]: <> (101BB)

----

More formal concept: (strictly) convex preferences $\Leftrightarrow$  (strictly) 'quasiconcave' utility function, allowing  'n goods':


With diminishing MRS, for a 'convex combination' of the two bundles $\mathbf{A}=(X_A,Y_A)$ and $\mathbf{D}=(X_D,Y_D)$


. . .


$$U(\alpha\mathbf{A}+(1-\alpha)\mathbf{D})\geq\alpha U(\mathbf{A}) + (1-\alpha)U(\mathbf{D})$$

where $0<\alpha<1$.

(Note switch to a 'weak inequality' here for quasiconcavity, strict for 'strict quasiconcavity')


. . .

e.g., (with two goods),


$$U(\alpha X_A + (1-\alpha)X_D,\alpha Y_A + (1-\alpha)Y_D)\geq  $$
$$\alpha(U((X_A,Y_A)) + (1-\alpha)(U(X_D,Y_D))$$


<aside class="notes">One reason economists like this 'quasiconcavity' is because it rules out local, but not global optima, so we only need to use

 the first-order conditions to find the optima.

 Looking under the lamp or 'without loss of generality'?</aside>

 <aside class="notes">Note that 'quasiconcavity' does not require differentiability,

 and it is preserved under a 'monotonic transformation' (stretching).

 This means its called an 'ordinal property'</aside>

Perfect substitutes

: when she is always willing to trade off A for B at a fixed rate (not necessarily 1 for 1)

Perfect complements

:     Goods A and B are Perfect Complements when an individual only gains utility from (more) A if she also consumes a defined (additional) amount of B, and vice-versa

### Budget constraint algebra


If I spend all my income `r format_with_col("(I will do over a 'relevant lifetime')","gray")`:

\

<!-- \pause -->



Expenditure on X + Expenditure on Y = Income (I)

\

$$P_X X + P_Y Y = I $$


. . .


To see how $Y$ trades off against $X$, rearrange this to:


. . .


\

$$Y = -\frac{P_X}{P_Y} X + \frac{I}{P_Y}$$


. . .


- Intercept $\frac{I}{P_Y}$: amount of Y you can buy if you only buy Y
- Slope $-\frac{P_X}{P_Y}$: how much Y you must give up to get another X

<!---
<aside class="notes">Adv: Strictly speaking, the slope is how much Y you *get* when you get another X,

but since this is negative we see that you 'get a negative amount', i.e., give up some amount of Y</aside>

###More insight

Recall $U=U(X,Y)$.

$$U_X(X,Y) := MU_X(X,Y)$$

\medskip


. . .


*Derivative w/ respect to X: rate utility increases if we add a little X, holding Y constant*

- Similarly for $MU_Y$.


. . .




MRS: 'how much Y would I be willing to give up to get a unit of X'?

. . .

Ans: Depends on marginal benefit of each ... we can show $MRS(X,Y)=\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}$

<aside class="notes">Intuition: the more valuable a little more X is to me  -- the higher is MU_X --

  the more Y I am willing to give up to get it. That is why MU_X is in the numerator</aside>

<aside class="notes">See derivation in handout if interested</aside>

[comment]: <> (101BB)

----


The 'first order change in utility' (or 'total differential') is:

$$ dU  = \frac{\partial U}{\partial X}dX + \frac{\partial U}{\partial Y}dY$$
$$ = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY$$

- Where = $\frac{\partial U}{\partial X}$ refers to the partial derivative of U(X,Y) with respect to X, and similarly for Y. I.e., the marginal utility.

. . .



Essentially, approximates the total change in utility for very small changes in X and Y.
Setting it equal to zero and rearranging it yields the rate, at the margin, one is willing to give up Y for X:


$$ dU  = MU_{X}dX + MU_{Y}dY = 0 $$

$$\frac{dY}{dX}=-\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{Y}}$$



<aside class="notes">This is a simple case of the implicit function theorem,

 essentially $U(X,Y)=c$ defines an implicit function Y(X), whose slope is the negative of the ratio of the derivatives.</aside>

Rearranging the utility maximising condition yields more intuition:

$$P_X/P_Y = MRS = MU_X/MU_Y$$
\


. . .

\medskip

$$\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$$

Same 'bang for each buck' (`r format_with_col("if","red")` optimising)

<aside class="notes">If this didn't hold true and you were spending on both goods,

you would be paying 'more per util' for one good than the other,

and thus should reallocate to that other good.</aside>


<aside class="notes">The more valuable a little more X is to me at that point

 -- the higher is MU_x -- the more Y I'm willing to give up to get it.

That is why MU_x is in the numerator.
The more valuable a bit more Y is at that point -- the higher is MU_y -- the less Y I am willing to give up to get a bit more X.

 That is why MU_y is in the denominator</aside>

###Cobb-Douglas general form (from other text)

$$U(X,Y)=X^aY^b$$

where a, b are positive constants


. . .


This is *"homothetic"*:


<aside class="notes">Homothetic: MRS constant along a ray through the origin

 Can be represented by an HD1 utility function.

ties down 'income effects' in a boring way

consumption of each good expands proportionally in income,

so impact of 1 consumer's income increasing by \$1 million the same as 1 miln consumers' gaining \$1;

underlies 'representative consumer' models;

... poor man just buys a tiny amount of foies gras and jumps in a tiny money bin</aside>


$$MU_X=\frac{\partial U}{\partial X} = aX^{a-1}Y^b$$
$$MU_Y=\frac{\partial U}{\partial Y} = bX^{a}Y^{b-1}$$


. . .


Taking the ratio of these yields

$$MRS = \frac{a}{b}\frac{Y}{X}$$


. . .


So only the *ratio* Y/X affects the MRS; e.g., double both and MRS is the same.

$$U(X,Y)=X+ln(Y)$$

Here Y has a diminishing MU, but for X MU is constant

So the MRS increases as Y increases, but it's independent of the amount of X consumed.

#Lecture3: (Chapter 3) Demand Curves

##Discussion question

>the price of beans went up, so people started buying more beans

## Lecture 3 (Chapter 3): Demand Curves -- key goals


1. To derive *individual's* demand curve from her utility function

2. What properties do demand curves have?


. . .


3. Understand (\& derive) related concepts/outcomes:
    - Substitution and income effects (of a price change)
    - Goods that are 'substitutes' or 'complements'
    - ... Normal and inferior goods; Giffen goods
    - Consumer surplus (from a transaction)
    - The lump-sum principle (and the distortion of taxation)

. . .

4. What is a *market* demand curve, and how do we derive it?

----

- 4. Understand the concepts and how to compute:
    - Price elasticity (of market demand for a product), and what it means to firms' pricing strategy
    - Income elasticity (...)
    - Cross-price elasticity (between two products)

- 5. Learn to discuss real world applications of the above


##Demand functions

- Previous: consumption choices determined by utility functions/indifference curves and budget constraints

. . .

$$Quantity \: of \: X \: demanded = d_x(P_X, P_Y, I; preferences)$$


<aside class="notes">LC: Write this on the board</aside>


----

###Homogeneity

Homogeneous (of degree zero) (demand) function
:      A function whose outcome value does not change when all arguments are changed proportionally


. . .


<br> \bigskip

$d_X(P_X,P_Y,I)$ is homogenous in its arguments


<br> \bigskip

- Multiply all prices and income by same amount $\rightarrow$ budget constraint unchanged $\rightarrow$ consumption choices the same


. . .

- E.g., $P_X X + P_Y Y = I$ is the same as $2P_X X + 2P_Y Y = 2I$


<aside class="notes">Intuition: Graphically, the budget line and indifference curves are unchanged, so the point of tangency is the same.

 Consider, if your income, as well as prices, were stated in pennies rather than pounds (e.g., 5 million pennies rather than \pounds50,000), why would your choices change?</aside>

<aside class="notes">This relates to the puzzle of 'why should monetary policy and inflation have any real effect?'</aside>

----

##Response to income changes


$$d_x(P_X, P_Y, I; preferences)$$

<br> \bigskip


- What happens to the quantity purchased of some good as your income increases?

<aside class="notes">LC: Ask this as class question</aside>


. . .


- Depends on whether the good is *normal* or *inferior*

<br> \bigskip

<aside class="notes">Whether it is normal or inferior depends on your preferences and the change in the slope of the indifference curves with higher income/utility, as we see below</aside>



Normal good
:     A good that is bought in greater quantities as income increases.

Inferior good
:     A good that is bought in smaller quantities as income increases.

----

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='4in', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("normalgood.png")
```

<aside class="notes">Two things going on here:

1. A wider set of consumption possibilities ... can afford more of X for any Y and v/v

2. At higher levels of consumption and utility the psychic tradeoffs (mrs) may change</aside>




----


![inferior](inferiorgood.png) \

<aside class="notes">More income, less expenditure on Z?

It's bc the shape of indifference curves differs at higher incomes here; shallower.

When people have a lot to spend, they want to spend it on Y and not on Z.

If you won the lottery how much pot noodle would you buy?</aside>


<aside class="notes">Adv: To be precise, it's *not* about wealthy people being different than poor people

... We're considering the *same* person with higher income.
Thinking in 3d: 'as you walk up this hill, it's ridge gradually moves to the west'</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv: Consider -- all goods cannot be inferior. Why not?</aside>

<aside class="notes">Move to PPT slides to illustrate this,

 beginning with 'Changes in Income: A Normal Good'</aside>

##Substitution and income effects from a fall (or rise) in price

$$d_x(P_X, P_Y, I; preferences)$$

<br> \bigskip

What happens to the quantity purchased of some good when the price of the good falls or rises?


<aside class="notes">Changes both an intercept and a slope.

New utility-maximizing choice on *another* indifference curve is

 a point on that curve with a different MRS.</aside>


. . .


Substitution effect ('Hicksian')
:     The effect on consumption due to a change in price 'holding utility constant.'

`r format_with_col("Precisely: effect on the lowest-cost bundle yielding this utility","gray")`

[comment]: <> (101BB)

<aside class="notes">this is the impact of price on the 'compensated' or 'Hicksian' demand.

This comes from the equivalent 'dual' problem of minimising expenditure subject to a fixed utility.</aside>

[comment]: <> (101EE)


. . .


Income effect (of a price change)
:     The remaining effect on consumption; price change $\rightarrow$ change in purchasing power/achievable utility.

<aside class="notes">This is conceptual: we never *actually* observe either of these effects alone;

 we always observe the net effect of both</aside>

<aside class="notes">Standard definition of the 'income effect' of a price change

combines both 'effects of an income change' we saw above

more consumption of each good is possible, but the MRS may differ at this higher utility</aside>

----

![income and substitution effects](incomeandsubstfx.png) \

<aside class="notes">Move to PPT slides to illustrate this,

 beginning with 'Change in A Good's Price'</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv: This topic is more nuanced and complicated than we will cover in the main content of this module.

To fully cover this, we would have to consider the theoretical concept of a 'compensated' aka 'Hicksian' demand curve,

where income is adjusted to hold utility constant while price ratios change.

This also allows us to consider 'net versus gross' substitution, and 'equivalent vs compensating variation'.

More advanced economics modules will cover this extensively and rigorously.</aside>

----

- Substitution effect: `r format_with_col("\underline{always","blue")` opposite direction as price change}

<!-- \pause -->

- Income effect
    - Normal good $\rightarrow$ `r format_with_col("Opposite direction as price change","blue")`
    - Inferior good: `r format_with_col("Same direction as price change","brown")`
<!-- \pause -->

<br> \bigskip
Thus

- Normal good: Substitution \& income effects go in *same direction*

<!-- \pause -->

- Inferior good: Substitution \& income effects go in opposite directions
    - $\rightarrow$ *Net* effect unknown
    - Usually substitution effect dominates `r format_with_col("but see Giffen goods","gray")`

----

**Read on your own, know:**

- Numerical example of response to price change
- The relative importance of substitution effects for most goods
- Substitution and income effects for inferior goods

## Different substitution effects

- Perfect complements: No substitution effect, only an income effect of a price change

- Perfect substitutes: Large substitution effect -- price change may cause a complete switch

- In between: depends on curvature of indifference curve

## The (legendary?) Giffen good


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("griffin.jpg")
```

- If the price of a good increases, can quantity demanded actually *increase*?!


. . .


- Yes, if the good is *very* inferior and is a large portion of income

<aside class="notes">
- But it has never been seen and documented in the wild

- See Powerpoint (if time permits)

- Practice question: try to draw indifference curves and budget constraints illustrating this effect for a Giffen good

##Some other important functions to know about (doctoral prep):

Indirect utility function: the (max) utility you can get as a function of your income and prevailing prices.


$$V(p_x,p_y,I_0)$$

. . .

Expenditure function: How much income you need to to get a certain utility given prevailing prices.

Hicksian (compensated) Demand for X: The amount of X I consume in a 'minimising expenditure' bundle that yields some level of utility ($U_0$)

<br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("Note: These functions are actually used in 'structural' estimates of demand used in merger analysis, pricing, litigation consulting, etc.","gray")`

----

- These are 'inverses' of one another
- because 'Maximise utility s.t. a budget constraint' has a special relationship ('Duality') with 'minimise expenditure s.t. attaining a particular level of utility'


. . .


Look:

$$V(p_x,p_y,E(p_x,p_y,U_0))=U_0$$


'My utility when I have enough income (expenditure) to give me utility $U_0$ ... is $U_0$'


. . .



$$E(p_x,p_y,V(p_x,p_y,I_0))=I_0$$


'The amount I need to spend to get the utility I can achieve with income $I_0$ is $I_0$'


----



$$h_x(p_x,p_y,U_0)=d_x(p_x,p_y,E(p_x,p_y,U_0))$$


'The amount of X I consume that yields $U_0$ at the lowest cost

is the amount of X I would consume if I had the income that allowed me to get utility $U_0$.'


. . .


<br> \bigskip

Totally differentiating these identities allows us to relate the compensated and uncompensated *responses* to price changes.

Intuitions...

<aside class="notes">Roy's identity: involved proof, uses envelope theorem.

 Intuition... utility decreases when  $p_X$ rises ...  $\frac{\partial V</aside>{\partial p_x}$.
From  initial consumption point we lose  $d_X \times \epsilon$ in spending power.

 The marginal deteriment to our utility of this 'income loss' goes at rate $\frac{\partial V}{\partial I}$.}

##Intuition from the 'Slutsky equation'


$$\frac{\partial d_x}{\partial p_x}= \frac{\partial h_x}{\partial p_x} - \frac{\partial d_x}{\partial I}x$$


. . .


At the margin, the change in demand for x in response to a change in its price sums:

<!-- \pause -->

- The compensated change in demand (first term on the right); the marginal substitution effect
- the income effect multiplied by the amount of x consumed
    - bc $p_x \uparrow$ $\rightarrow$ 'remaining income' $\downarrow$ in proportion to amount of x consumed

<aside class="notes">A similar result applies to a change in *another* good's price</aside>

## Shifts in the Market Demand Curve

- Similar things that cause individual demand curve shifts
    - Increases in overall income (for normal goods)
    - Reduced prices of complements, increased price of substitutes

    <br> \bigskip


<aside class="notes">You can only express the demand curve as a function of aggregate income under restrictive assumptions.

  In general, it depends *who* gets this income. (See 'aggregation issues').</aside>

Elasticity

:     the measure of the \% change in one variable brought about by a 1\% change in another variable.

- a *unitless* measure; will be the same no matter how these variables are measured.

<aside class="notes">Think of responsiveness when talking about elasticity. Actually it's a measure from physics having to do with rubber bands, they tell me.</aside>
<aside class="notes">Adv, maths: Strictly speaking we are talking about the limit of these responses, i.e., derivatives.

  The elasticity is basically the derivative of $ln(y)$ with respect to $ln(x)$; useful to know if you want to run a regression computing an elasticity, or if you want to interpret such a regression.</aside>

----

- If a 5\% fall in the price of oranges typically results in a 10\% increase in quantity bought

- we might say that 'each percent fall in the price of oranges leads to an increase in sales of about 2 percent'


. . .


- i.e., the 'elasticity' of orange sales wrt price is about 2 <!-- \pause -->

    - But elasticities need not be constant; they may depend on starting point

    - E.g., linear demand $\rightarrow$ different price elasticity at each point

[comment]: <> (101BB)

##Elasticities more precisely

- calculate in terms of derivatives

- estimated using log transformations

    - Regress log y on log x

    - Actually this is only approximately correct, better to estimate exponential form (see Santos-Silva and Tenyreyro)

[comment]: <> (101EE)

## Price elasticity of demand

Price elasticity of demand:
$$e_{Q_d,p} = \frac{percent \ change \ in \ Q_d}{percent \ change \ in \ p} $$
$$  = \frac{\Delta Q_d}{Q_d}/\frac{\Delta p}{p}$$

`r format_with_col("(actually, the limit of this as these changes converge to zero)","gray")`

. . .


- Should always be negative (except for Giffen goods)

- A unitless measure related to the slope of the demand curve

- *Very* important for price-setting firms (more on this later)

----

[comment]: <> (101BB)

*From the NS text (footnote)*

if demand happens to take the 'constant elasticity' form
$Q=aP^b$ where $b<0$, the price elasticity of demand is b.

- This elasticity is the same everywhere along such a demand curve.


- Taking logarithms of this yields $ln(q) = ln(a) + b ln(p)$

- note elasticities are often estimated by regressing logs on logs

Properties of price elasticity of demand:

- Goods w/ close substitutes at a close price $\rightarrow$  highly elastic
- ... with few substitutes ...  inelastic
- Typically: elasticity greater in *long run* than short run. `r format_with_col("Why?","blue")`

<aside class="notes">Ans: Over time, consumers can adjust to price changes by changing their consumption patterns.

 E.g., if petrol gets more expensive I can switch to a hybrid or electric car, or a bicycle.</aside>

- Total expenditure (revenue): price $\times$ quantity

<aside class="notes">Q: A price-setting firm should basically never want to set its price at a point where demand is inelastic. Why not?</aside>

<aside class="notes">Ans: If it were at such a point, it could raise its price and its revenue would increase and costs would decline

 (because it would be selling fewer products but for greater total revenue.)

 A caveat is that it might do this for a long term strategic advantage; e.g., to gain customer loyalty and market share, intending to take its profits later.</aside>

#Lecture4: Production [(30 min) - NS Ch 7 (parts)]

## Lecture  (30 min) - Production - coverage


- T1:04

- NS: Ch 6: Production
<aside class="notes">We will go rather quickly over this material, as it is largely revision</aside>
- 6.1 Production function
- 6.2 Marginal product
- 6.3 Isoquant maps
- 6.4 Returns to scale

\note{Skip input substitution, technological change}


----

*Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study)*

1. Understand how economists depict a firm's *production function*
1. ... and how a firm can 'trade off one input for another' in producing a particular output
1. ... and why the production function may have *increasing returns to scale* or *diminishing returns to scale*

`r format_with_col("Think about: How does the firm's production choice differ from a consumer's consumption choice?","gray")`


## The Firm's Production function

- Production function:  mathematical relationship between inputs and outputs.


. . .


$$q = f( K, L, M, ...)$$


$$q = f(K, L)$$

- e.g., $q =2L^{1/3}K^{2/3}$

. . .


- Given choice of 'amount to produce', firm tries to produce it at the minimum cost
    - Like consumer maximizing utility st budget constraints


<aside class="notes">A major difference: firm *also* chooses the level of output... later chapters

Also, output is *observable and measurable</aside>


[comment]: <> (101BB)

<aside class="notes">More general: 'Production possibility set'

Set of all vectors (called 'production plans') that contain feasible combinations of inputs and outputs

 Allows us to conside things like economies of scope </aside>

[comment]: <> (101EE)

##Marginal product

Marginal product
:     Additional output from adding +1 unit of an input, holding other inputs constant.

. . .


Marginal Product of Labour: $MP_L$

- Slope of production function in units of labour (holding capital etc constant)


. . .

$$MP_L=\frac{\partial}{\partial L}f(K,L)$$

- Similarly for Marginal Product of Capital $MP_K$


- *Standard asn: diminishing MP of each input*


##Output curves, marginal product curve, average product

## Isoquant maps, rate of technical substitution (RTS)


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='4.5in', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("prod_isoquant1.png")

----

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='4.5in', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("prod_isoquant2.png")
```

<aside class="notes">Q: How do these isoquants display 'diminishing marginal product' of each input?</aside>

<aside class="notes">Ans: Slope gets steeper as we move towards more capital, less labour

Implying with more K we need to add more and more K to make up for a loss of a small amount of L.

 Slope shallower with more L, less K ... similar point</aside>

<aside class="notes">'Iso' probably means 'the same' in some language.

So 'isoquants' connect all points, all combinations of output that produce the same 'quant'(ity.)</aside>

<aside class="notes">The slope of these is called the 'Rate of Technical Substitution,' to be defined shortly</aside>



----


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='4.5in', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("prod_isoquant3.png")
```

----

Marginal rate of technical substitution (RTS)
:     Amount one input can be reduced when +1 unit of another input is added, holding output constant

. . .


RTS = - slope of the isoquant


. . .


|(change in capital) / (change in labor)|


----

$$RTS = MP_L/MP_K$$

- RTS is the ratio of marginal products

<aside class="notes">This is fundamentally similar to the reason why the MRS was the ratio of marginal utilities!</aside>


Makes sense:

- If MPL large I can give up much K, bc gaining L adds a lot of production

- If MPK large I can't give up much K to get more L, bc reducing K reduces output a lot

- *Diminishing* RTS

## Returns to scale

*Are bigger firms always more efficient? Do things get cheaper to produce the more we produce?*

<aside class="notes">If so, what limits the size of firms? I.e., why don't we see only one firm in each industry?</aside>

Returns to scale
:     The rate at which output increases in response to a proportional increase in *all* inputs.


----

Constant returns to scale (CRS)
:     If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor equal to X.

- E.g., doubling all inputs (labor, capital, land, etc) means exactly doubling all outputs


. . .


\

\medskip

Increasing returns to scale (IRS)
:     If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor greater than X.


. . .


Decreasing returns to scale (DRS)
:     If inputs increase by a factor of X, output increases by a factor less than X.


----



### Arguments/reasons for scale (dis)economies

**IRS**

- Fixed costs (incorporation, buildings, management, planning, R\&D) spread over more units

- Should always be able to at least 'double everything' and produce twice as much? (so at least CRS)

- Scale allows specialisation

. . .

\
<br> \bigskip

----


**Arguments for DRS**

- Limited resources in (relevant) economy; costs begin to rise
- Managerial issues and coordination problems, bigger 'centre' to lobby for favours.  `r format_with_col("See 'theories of the firm'","gray")`
- Harder to give incentives to top manager/CEO?

<aside class="notes">Adv: I think the first point is valid,

 but it doesn't suggest that 2 firms would be more efficient than 1;

these DRS would set in as a function of  *total* output, not a single firm's output.

 The second and third arguments are complicated and perhaps harder to justify.

 The case for DRS is unproven, IMHO</aside>

----

### Interesting case: 'Minimum efficient scale' (MES) production


- E.g., rental costs/maintenance of 3D printer: \pounds10,000 per year (no matter how much is printed)

. . .

- Each printer can print up to 100 artificial heads per year
    - If produce $<$ 100 heads/year, cost/head not minimised
    - Here MES is 100
        - You should produce in multiples of 100, but could be CRS for each multiple of 100

#Lecture5: Costs [(1 hour), Costs, NS Ch 7]
## Lecture  (1 hour) - Production and costs - coverage
- T1:04


- NS: Ch 7
<aside class="notes">We will go rather quickly over this material, as it is largely revision</aside>
- 7.1 Basic cost concepts (largely revision)
- 7.2 Cost minimizing input choice
- 7.3 Cost curves
- (Skip: 7.4-7.6; short and long-run, Per-unit SR cost curves, shifts in cost curve, numerical example)

----

*Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study)*

1. Characterise and contrast different types of costs; how they should enter into firms' decisions (and life decisions!)
1. Depict a firm's *cost-minimising input choice*
- and its expansion path



## Basic cost concepts (largely revision)


Fixed costs (FC)
:    Must be regularly incurred to *remain* in business (i.e., for any level of output), but that do not vary with the level of output

\


Variable costs (VC)
:    Increase with the quantity produced.

\


. . .

Sunk costs
:     Have been incurred in the past, can never be recovered.

- Sunk costs should not enter into *any* economic decisions.
- FC from *previous* years are sunk; FC for future years are not.


<aside class="notes">This is not covered at this point in the text.

 However, this should be revision from last year.</aside>


----


Economic costs (DR)
:     *Additional* amounts *paid* for something. Relevant (to firm/consumer) when choosing

- How much *more* you have to pay to hire another worker, produce another unit, etc
- How much *more* it cost you to buy another song on Itunes


`r format_with_col("Contrast to *opportunity costs*.","gray")`

Opportunity Costs
:     The value that the inputs used to produce something would generate in their next-best use

. . .

- Relevant for *social efficiency*
    - Airline charges *you* \pounds1000 for a first-class upgrade, but if the seat is otherwise empty...
    - Leaving (first-class) seats empty is socially inefficient

<!---
Accounting costs
:    What was actually paid, even if long ago (may include sunk costs).  *Not* relevant at the point of a decision.
<aside class="notes">Please *don't* use accounting costs to make a decision going forward. </aside>

## Economic profits and cost minimisation; 2-input model

- Labour costs - wage rates $w$
- Capital costs - rental rate $v$


. . .

Total costs $= TC = wL + vK$

. . .


Economic profit = $\pi$ = Total Revenues - Total Costs

. . .


$$\pi = Pq-wL-vK = P\times f(K,L)-wL-vK$$

(P: price of good)

<aside class="notes">Economic profits differ from accounting profits,

 in part because economists charge the 'cost of capital', or the alternate use of the machine, against your profit.

  If I am investing \pounds1000 and I earn \pounds20 per year, but I could otherwise earn \pounds10 per year from a similarly risky investment,

  my *economic profit* is only \pounds10 per year</aside>

##  Cost minimizing input choice, expansion path, ratio condition

- Choose point where RTS = ratio of input prices
    - RTS = (wage rate/rental rate) = w/v
    - Same ratio of 'marginal productivity/price' for each input used

<aside class="notes">Again, this is very much like the consumer case. Recall the consumer set the MRS equal to the price ratio

The 'benefit tradeoff' must equal the 'price tradeoff' in both cases, otherwise we are not optimizing.</aside>

<aside class="notes">The same $q$ can be produced by combinations other than $K^*, L*$, but these will *cost more*.

The combination that produces q at the lowest cost is at the point tangent to the isocost line</aside>


----

*Intuition*

$$RTS = MP_L/MP_K = w/v$$

. . .


Equivalently, $\frac{MP_L}{w} = \frac{MP_K}{v}$

- At optimum, \pounds1 more spent on labour must produce as much as \pounds1 more on capital
    - Otherwise I'm not optimising, should reallocate
    - 'Bang for the buck'

Short Run (SR)
:     The period of time in which a firm must consider some inputs to be fixed in making its decisions.

- E.g., capital (K) is fixed but labour can vary

. . .

Long Run (LR)
:     The period of time in which a firm may consider all of its inputs to be variable in making its decisions.


- In this module, we mainly focus on the latter, where all inputs can be adjusted
    - Just be aware that SR cost curves will be more steeply sloping than LR cost curves

### MR for firm facing 'downward-sloping demand'

<aside class="notes">See example in table 1 in text</aside>

- Single price $\rightarrow$ sell more only by reducing price on *all units*
    - E.g., sell 51 units rather than 50 by reducing price from \pounds1 to \pounds0.99


. . .


- MR $<$ market price here *because*

- Get (new) market price for additional unit $\rightarrow$ + \pounds0.99


. . .


- But lose \pounds0.01 on all previous 50 units $\rightarrow$ - \pounds0.50

- So MR is \pounds0.49

<aside class="notes">Q: Why might MR curves typically decrease in Q?</aside>

### Inverse elasticity rule, intuition


Price elasticity of demand for single firm's output (q):

$e_{q,p} = abs\big((\% change in q) / (\% change in P)\big)


. . .

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("elast_vs_mr.png")
```


\


----

$e_{q,p}$ = abs\big((\% change in q) / (\% change in P)\big)

Rearranging the MR (derivative of revenue wrt price) yields:

$$MR= P(1-\frac{1}{e_{q,p}})$$


. . .


Intuition:

- Sell another unit, gain 'P' on that unit
- but lose '$P \times$ \% reduction in P needed for a \% increase in Q' on other units
    - the last term is the inverse of price elasticity

----


$$MR= P(1-\frac{1}{e_{q,p}})$$

. . .


Setting MR=MC $\rightarrow$


. . .


'markup as \% of price': $\frac{P-MC}{P}=\frac{1}{e_{q,p}}$


*(You don't have to memorise this formula)*

- It's called the 'Lerner markup rule'

<br> \bigskip


A firm that sought to maximize revenue (rather than profit) would choose to produce an output level for which marginal revenue was equal to


- a. marginal cost
- b. average cost.
- c. price.
- d. zero.
- e. as high as possible.


----

Choose all that apply: If the demand faced by a firm is elastic (but not perfectly elastic), selling one less unit of output will

- a.  decrease revenue.

*Key goals of these lectures (and accompanying self-study)*

- How firms' supply curves aggregate to the *market* supply curve
- What is a 'perfectly competitive market'?

. . .

Motivating questions:

- With many 'price taking firms', how does *aggregate* supply respond to changes in demand?
- Can such firms make a profit in the short run? In the long run?

- Importance of entry /& exit, implications for short \& long run:

- *LR market supply curve*: what it looks like \& why


----

...

- *Consumer surplus*,  *producer surplus*,  implications for welfare analysis
- Pareto Optimality

- Critiques of this, idea of 'market failure'


----

- Free entry of firms/no 'barriers'?

- Homogenous products?

- Descreasing returns to scale at some point?


<aside class="notes">These conditions will indeed lead to $\rightarrow$ perfect competition/MC pricing.

But many markets have large entry costs, first-mover advantages, and perhaps continuously increase returns to scale $\rightarrow$ monop/oligopoly

Most products are also 'differentiated'; with free entry  $\rightarrow$ 'monopolistic competition', another candidate for bring the dominant model</aside>


<br> \bigskip



----

**Deep political/philosophical question:**

Should we expect 'chaotic competition' to lead to the most efficient outcomes, and if so, when and under what conditions?


. . .


- Better to restrict the entry of firms `r format_with_col("(single firm with a guaranteed monopoly?)","gray")`

- Better to regulate prices?

<aside class="notes">Questions are at the core of political and economic debates

UK (and EU) firms: Unknown impact on input prices, demand curves, competition, etc.

- Can 'GE models' help predict these and help firms plan and reoptimise?

- How long will it take to return to some 'equilibrium'?


----


- Fewer firms in UK markets $\rightarrow$ less competition $\rightarrow$ loss of consumer surplus?

### Price acts as a signal, leading to efficient choices:

- to firms, telling them 'how much to produce'

<aside class="notes">Don't produce past where your MC exceeds the p you can get in the market; at p where market 'clears' $Q_d=Q_s$.</aside>

<!-- \pause -->

- to consumers, how much to purchase

<!-- \pause -->

- and 'which consumers should obtain the units produced'?

<aside class="notes">By the def of market-clearing price P*, consumers can buy all they desire at P*,

i.e., until last unit gives them a MU of P*.</aside>

<aside class="notes">Adv, foreshadowing equilibrium efficiency: Thus every consumer values last unit they consume the same

--> we *never* have the 'wrong' consumer obtains the good; --> no further gains from 'exchange among consumers'.

If prices were too low (e.g., because of a price ceiling), $Q_d>Q_s$

 demand would have to be rationed, and consumers who valued the product more than other consumers might not get as much. </aside>

## Shifts in S and D curves

<aside class="notes">Basically this should all be revision, but read it anyway. You are required to know this material.</aside>


## The Long run (ppt here)

In LR 'free entry and exit' of firms, many firms have access to  same production process

. . .


<br> \bigskip

Suppose *positive economic profits* in industry (for efficient producers)

- I.e., $P^*>AC(q)$ for some q

. . .


- $\rightarrow$ Firms enter
    - $\rightarrow$ Supply curve shifts out


- $\rightarrow$ equilibrium price declines
- $\rightarrow$ profits decline


. . .


- repeat until economic profit falls to zero
    - i.e., until $P^*=AC(q)$ for the minimum AC q

<aside class="notes">Positive economic profits are sometimes called 'supernormal profits.'

Rem: economic profits are *after* subtracting the (opportunity) cost of capital,

management, and other inputs</aside>

----

Now suppose *negative economic profits* in industry (for efficient producers)

- I.e., $P^*<AC(q)$ for any q


. . .

- $\rightarrow$ Firms exit
- $\rightarrow$ Supply curve shifts inwards

. . .

- $\rightarrow$ equilibrium price rises
- $\rightarrow$ profits rise
- repeat until economic profit rises to zero
- i.e., until $P^*=AC(q)$ for the minimum AC q

----

**Long Run Equilibrium**

Firms choose output to max profit

<br> \bigskip

Profit max: $P^* = MC(q)$


. . .

<br> \bigskip
<br> \bigskip


No firms *in* the market want to exit, no firms *outside* want to enter

<br> \bigskip


Zero economic profits:

$P^* = AC(q)$


----

*Also, with free entry/exit...*

<aside class="notes">(and with no production limits)...</aside>


<br> \bigskip

. . .

all firms (in) produce $q$ that *minimizes* their AC,  and all *same* average cost

<br> \bigskip

. . .


- I.e., $P^\ast = min[AC(q)] = MC(q)$ for any firm in the market

- I.e., MC curve intersects AC curve at its minimum.

    - and it's the *same* AC for all firms

. . .



`r format_with_col("Why?","blue")`


----

`r format_with_col("Why $P* = min [ac(q)] = mc(q)$?","blue")`

<br> \bigskip

No profit in equilibrium and firms choose q so that $P^\ast=mc(q)$


. . .

- $\rightarrow$ $P^\ast = AC(q) = MC(q)$ for all firms (in)

<br> \bigskip


. . .

- Suppose a firm produced at a point *above* it's minimum AC,
    - i.e., if $AC(q)> min [AC(q)]$


. . .

<br> \bigskip

- $\rightarrow$ it could profit by producing at the q that *minimised* its AC (contradicting above)

- ... so would other firms, who'd be induced to enter; so that couldn't have been an equilibrium

<aside class="notes">We assume a large number of firms have access to this efficient technology.

As previously mentioned, entry shifts the supply curve out, equilibrium price falls,

 until the point where $P^*=AC(q)$ for firms producing at this lowest AC point.</aside>

## Long Run (LR) Supply

- We have the SR supply curve (upward sloping)

- But we know that in the LR this will shift out in response to a price change

. . .


<br> \bigskip

$\rightarrow$ Taking this shift into account gives us the *Long Run Supply Curve*

<aside class="notes">Avoid confusion:

In the SR there are movements *along* this curve in response to price changes.

In the longer run, it does shift in response to price changes, as firms enter.

The LR supply curve, which we will now define, does *not* shift in response to price changes

But other things may cause it to shift, like changes in input costs</aside>

----

**LR supply curve looks like?**

- Demand curve shifts out $\rightarrow$ price rise $\rightarrow$ firms enter

- ... do firms produce at the *same* minimum AC as before?

. . .


<br> \bigskip

*Depends:*

- Does entry/higher production *change* cost function?

<!-- \pause -->

- So *input costs* rise?


<!-- \pause -->

- 'Externalities' between firms, consumers' `r format_with_col("(e.g., network externalities)","gray")`

<aside class="notes">increased demand for scarce inputs, skilled workers \& public resources</aside>
<aside class="notes">DR opinion: We shouldn't always expect the LR curve to be upward sloping.

 might also be flat or downward sloping. Thus, if the demand curve for, e.g., microchips or personalised software

 shifts out, we may see that equilibrium price *declines* in the long run.</aside>

<big>Long run population and economic growth $\rightarrow$ ?<big>


<br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("As the economy grows, which items will get relatively more expensive?","blue")`

<aside class="notes">Economic,  population growth leads to increased demand for most products

(esp. natural resources and primary products). The shape of the LR supply curve tells us

Relative slope for different products tells us which prices will rise *relative* to other goods.

 E.g., will housing become relatively more or less expensive?</aside>

## Consumer and producer surplus, efficiency

Consumer surplus (reprise)

:      Extra value ... from consuming good over its price. WTP for right to consume a good at its current price.

- Area between the demand curve and the market price

----

Producer surplus
:     Value producers get for a good less the opportunity costs they incur by producing it. What producers would pay for right to sell good at current market price.

. . .


- Area between supply curve and market price

<aside class="notes">Basically producer surplus is profit + unavoidable costs.

In the SR you cannot shut down and avoid the fixed costs, whether or not you sell any units.

Since you are already incurring these, they don't count against the benefit you would get from selling at the market price.</aside>

. . .


- In LR, zero-profits, all costs are variable $\rightarrow$ producer surplus is zero


<aside class="notes">Adv: When a firm owns a unique resource it can arguably make a LR profit called a 'Ricardian rent'.

However this could be seen as the return to an asset which should be 'charged against' these profits.</aside>

### In what sense is a competitive market 'efficient'? (roughly)

\medskip

Allocation of resources maximizes total surplus

<br> \bigskip

total surplus $=$ consumer $+$ producer surplus

- \footnotesize{At market equilibrium: no more mutually-beneficial exchanges}

'A *competitive* market *in equilibrium* will max total surplus'

 knitr::include_graphics("consumerprodrsurplusmax.png")
```

<aside class="notes">Q* maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus.

Any other quantity yields a lower sum. E.g., at Q1 we 'lose' the triangle FEG

 ... this is called a 'deadweight loss' as it is a loss to society, it just disappears.</aside>


<aside class="notes">Note this doesn't tell us that the supply curve reflects efficient production, nor that the 'right' consumers get the good</aside>

We can use these models/concepts to consider...


- 'Who suffers from a tax' in the LR and SR?

- Who gains from technological innovation?


. . .


- Who gains and who is harmed by trade restrictions, and do the costs outweigh the benefits?

#Recapping GE/efficiency

----

 *Choose one or all that are correct.*
The following situation(s) or condition(s), individually implies/imply that the economy has NOT attained a Pareto efficient outcome.



A. We can produce more toothbrushes without producing less toothpaste, but doing so would require us to produce less food; all three goods are valued by consumers



B. the economy is not producing any liverwurst; however, liverwurst does not enter into any consumer's utility function. \

C.     at the current levels of consumption, older people are willing to give up two toothbrushes for one toothpaste, while younger people are willing to trade these off one-for one, and both groups have a positive amount of each \

D. at current production, the PPF implies we could produce one fewer tube of toothpaste and thus produce two more toothbrushes; however, all consumers have a MRS of 1 between these two goods, and are consuming a positive amount of both

## General equilibrium and efficiency: Coverage

- This is a very brief excerpt and summary of the material in NS chapter 10, with some additional motivation
- If you understand these slides/notes you don't have to read chapter 10

## Key principles for efficiency and 'general' equilibrium


*Under certain conditions* competitive markets are efficient in equilibrium

<br> \bigskip

. . .


But:

- Some markets may not reach equilibrium 'quickly'

. . .


- These conditions may not hold $\rightarrow$ *market failure*


. . .


- Efficiency itself doesn't imply preferred outcomes: can involve a great deal of inequality

----

*General Equilibrium* (GE) analysis: entire economy as a system of interacting, interdependent markets

- GE: set of prices s.t. $Q_s(P)=Q_d(P)$ in *all* markets, including input markets

<aside class="notes">E.g., government push for tomato consumption shifts tomato demand out, prices up

this lead to LR shift out in tomato supply curves (firms enter)

increases demand for *inputs* like farm labour, raises cost of production of other veg, etc

Will we return to equilibrium, and with what prices and quantities?

Stay tuned true believers! (and take more Econ, because we won't cover it here) </aside>

Overall Pareto efficiency: no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off

- `r format_with_col("Why is this how we define efficiency?","blue")`


. . .


- If we *could* do so, we would not be at an efficient point


<aside class="notes">Pareto efficiency is hard to disagree with, as a policy goal;

if we could move to a situation where some were better off and none made worse off, we should do it.</aside>


----

Overall efficiency requires several conditions:


Efficiency in production (being on the PPF)
:     No way to reallocate inputs to increase production of one good without reducing production of another


<br> \bigskip



Given society's resources, we are producing 'as much as possible'

###Formal conditions, argument for efficiency in production


Specifically, economy produces on the PPF: given available inputs, we produce 'as much as possible'

. . .


I.e., cannot produce more of any good without producing less of some other good

<aside class="notes">Basic argument: firms hire more of each input until its 'bang for buck' is the same as all other inputs,

a single market price for the input will ensure this is the same across firms.

This 'equilibrium' input price must reflect its marginal productivity in producing the 'last unit' for *each and every firm and product

MRTS(k,l) must be equal across all firms/products, otherwise they would 'trade'</aside>

----



Efficiency in consumption (exchange efficiency)
:     No way to reallocate output amongst consumers to make them all better off


. . .


<br> \bigskip



Given what we're producing, it is going to the 'right consumers'.



<aside class="notes">Basic argument for productive efficiency of competitive equilibrium:

If, given the 'endowments', one person values A in units B more than someone else,

an equilibrium price ensures that they will trade these amongst one another until each has the same MRS

The 'Edgeworth box' offers a graphical demonstration that this yields a Pareto optimum (given the amounts produced).</aside>

###Formal conditions and argument for efficiency in consumption (Exchange efficiency)

Specifically: No way to reallocate output amongst consumers to make them all better off


. . .


<br> \bigskip

With DMRS, this is equivalent to 'for the last (positive) unit of X purchased by each consumer, they are all willing to give up the same amount of X to get another Y'


. . .


I.e., their marginal rates of substitution for the last unit they buy are all the same: equal to the price ratio.


<br> \bigskip

. . .


$\leftarrow$ basically ensured by the $MRS(x,y)=p_x/p_y$ 'bang for the buck' condition.

<aside class="notes">Edgeworth box shows how this could occur more directly through exchange

the price that leads one guy to want to 'sell A units of X and buy B units of Y',

 and also leads the other guy to want to 'buy A units of X and sell B units of X'

 leads them to both have the same MRS at this 'equilibrium bundle</aside>

----

Given our inputs, we can produce 'efficiently', i.e, along the PPF,

<br> \bigskip

and given the amounts of each good produced, it is 'consumed by the right people' (no more room for trade) ...

yet we may still not be at efficiency? `r format_with_col("Why not?","blue")`

----

We need to produce the right *combination* of goods.

<br> \bigskip
<br> \bigskip

Efficient allocation of resources ('top-level' condition)
:     No way to produce more of one good and less of another to make all consumers better off

<aside class="notes">Basic argument for top-level efficiency of competitive equilibrium:

Equilibrium prices from exchange reflect each consumer's marginal rates of substitution for their last unit

This signals to firms the rate at which *all* consumers would be willing to trade off A for B at the margin

In equilibrium firms produce at a point where the cost tradeoffs between A and B (slope of PPF) reflects these prices.</aside>

----

###Formal conditions/argument for top-level cond.

(Given we're on PPF), can't adjust product mix to make any consumers better off without making some worse off


. . .

\medskip


DMRT on the PPF \& DMRS for consumers (rem: all have same MRS)...

$\leftrightarrow MRS(x,y)=MRT(x,y)$,


. . .



'marginal tradeoff in production = marginal tradeoff in consumption'

'slope of PPF at chosen point = slope of everyone's indifference curve at their chosen point'

. . .


Optimizing consumers, free exchange $\rightarrow$ MRS reflects relative prices

. . .

competitive firms choose q's s.t. $mc(q_x)=p_x$ $\forall$ firms, goods

$\rightarrow$ ratios are equal

<aside class="notes">through free exchange, price signals, competition</aside>


----

First fundamental theorem of welfare economics
:     A general competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient, under standard assumptions


<br> \bigskip


- Intuition: free exchange leaves no room for mutually-beneficial improvements, and firms and consumers optimise

----


Second fundamental theorem
:     Under some fancy assumptions, any Pareto efficient outcome is a competitive equilibrium for *some* pattern of initial endowments


. . .

<br> \bigskip

So if we could costlessly redistribute *endowments*, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome by doing so, and then relying on the free market.

First fundamental theorem of welfare economics

- $\rightarrow$ Prices won't reflect marginal costs $\rightarrow$ 'deadweight losses'

2. Externalities, public goods, altruism

Assumptions: 'anything someone values' is bought \& sold in the market on their own behalf

<br> \bigskip

But:

- Externalities: All costs (\& benefits) may not be priced; e.g., pollution

- Public goods (and bads): Many benefit from the same good (e.g., fireworks)


. . .


- Altruism/interdependent utilities: People care about *others'* consumption


----

3. Asymmetric information: People have different information about the state of the world (costs, risks, a good's quality...)


<br> \bigskip


. . .


4. Bounded rationality: people may not choose in their own best interests


----

**Second Welfare theorem**

If we could costlessly redistribute *endowments*, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome

by redistributing and then relying on the free market

But:

- Redistribution via 'optimal lump-sum' taxes isn't easy, as endowments may be unobservable


- and redistribution based on things you can affect, e.g. income, may distort incentives.

#Notes on supplementary reading

## Supplementary reading:

- Slonim, Robert, Carmen Wang, and Ellen Garbarino. "The market for blood." The Journal of Economic Perspectives 28.2 (2014): 177-196.

----

##Key points:

An unusual 'market' (or non-market)

- Altruism, repugnance, asymmetric information about disease

- Limited storage of blood

. . .


- Many countries have *volunteer* supply, so no 'price' to donate
    - Volunteer behavior responds to entirely different motivations! Not guided by demand.
- $\rightarrow$  How efficient can it be?


----

>  imbalances between aggregate supply and demand are a major challenge in blood markets, including excess supply after disasters and insufficient supply at other times.

. . .


> not unexpected given that the blood market operates without market prices and with limited storage length (about six weeks) for whole blood.


. . .


> Yet shifting to a system of paying blood donors seems a practical impossibility given attitudes toward paying blood donors and concerns that a paid system could compromise blood safety.

----

- Large variation in systems across countries (volunteer versus paid and family/friend donors)

. . .

- Historical shifts:
    - Paid 'blood on the hoof', markets needed immediate matching
    - Better storage, blood banking, impersonal diffuse markets
    - WWII: Patriotism, voluntary donations
    - AIDS crisis

----

Issues with paying donors

- Does it crowd out intrinsic motivation?

. . .

- Does it bring moral hazard and 'select' the wrong, unsafe donors?


. . .

- Is it harmful to the donors (paternalistic idea)

- or otherwise 'repugnant'?


----

Issues with volunteer supply

- Not adequate in many countries


. . .

- Responds to other motivations than actual need, as there is no price

    - Donate more after disasters like 9-11 even where need is *not* high

    - But agencies don't want to turn away donors ('ungrateful', signal 'never need blood')

    - May provide scope for political intervention

    - How does this happen?


. . .


- One potential source of market failure: Public Goods

## Public Goods (attributes, categories)

What are the characteristics of a public good?


----

*Def* -- A **Pure Public Good** is a good that is both


. . .


1. *Non-excludable*: Once the good is provided, it is impossible/costly to prevent any individual from using/benefiting from it.

<aside class="notes">Even individuals who have not paid for it</aside>

<aside class="notes">Opposite: Exclusive goods*: ... if it is relatively easy to bar people from benefitting from it once it has been produced</aside>



. . .

2. *Non-rival:* One person's consumption doesn't reduce the quantity available for others.



. . .


- The fact that some people use the good doesn't prevent others from using the *same* good.

- There is no 'crowding.'

- Provision/consumption to additional users at zero marginal (social) cost.


<aside class="notes">Q: think of some examples.</aside>


<aside class="notes">In market economies, private suppliers provide the majority of goods and services to consumers. However, certain goods are publicly provided.

  These include for example defense, education, and health. Why does the government instead of the market provide these goods?  Which characteristics differentiate goods that are privately provided from goods that are publicly provided? How do we define public goods?

The terminology might induce the conclusion that '----public goods are good that are publicly provided as opposed to private goods which are privately provided.' This conclusion is simply WRONG! The public or private nature of the good is an intrinsic characteristic of goods that is not related to the provider of the good
Hence, it may well be that the state provides a private good or that the market provides a public good.</aside>

**What about?**

- Loud music coming from my window
- Disease control
- Economic research

- Fireworks in Disney World
- The 2012 Olympics in London

----

**The basic ideas**

If a good is *non-rival* then additional provision (of the units produced, to more consumers) is costless.

. . .

Thus,

- if exclusion is possible, and *any* positive price is charged, some are deterred from consuming it


<!-- \pause -->


- this is inefficient: people who could benefit from the good, at no cost to others, will not consume it :(


And...

----

(If non-rival)

Even if each person provided it for their *own* benefit (on the assumption that no one else would), they would typically choose *too little* from a social POV...


<br> \bigskip

Considering their own marginal benefits (and MRS) versus the price or cost, not the *social* marginal benefit (an 'externality' to them)



----

If a good is *non-excludable* it will be difficult to charge people for it

- many will prefer to wait for *others* to buy it, and then they enjoy it anyways (free-ride) `r format_with_col("(that's a 'coordination problem')","gray")`

. . .

But if firms cannot charge for its full value, they might not pay the fixed costs to develop/build/provide it

- Who would pay to produce a film that is freely pirated/distributed?

- Who would pay to develop a drug that must be priced at its marginal cost?

- Why contribute to police protection for your village, if your neighbours will pay for it anyways?

<aside class="notes">Loosely, 'rivalryness' basically relates to whether market provision will be *efficient*,

 while 'excludability' tells you whether firms can make *significant amounts of revenue* from providing it, selling (access to) the same produced good to more than one person</aside>

----

\underline{Motivation}

**Policy:** 'Public goods argument' - justifies many government programmes (military, environmental cleanup, research, etc)

. . .


- $\rightarrow$ Inefficient: some consumers may value drug at \pounds100's, far above MC, yet they don't consume it


. . .


- Possible solution: Government *awards* and subsidies for drug development.

<aside class="notes">In fact, governments do fund and subsidise R\&D. But there are difficulties here too. Governments may free-ride off of other governments.

It is also for government to know whom to fund, hard to quantify the benefits to potential drugs, and offering 'prizes' to developers offers its own challenges:

how to asses if the drug is good enough to deserve the prize? And too many firms working on the same drug may be wasteful.</aside>


## Public Goods and Market Failure

The First Welfare Theorem's assumptions/conditions do not apply to public goods. Markets do not yield a Pareto Optimal outcome.

<aside class="notes">The market will not produce where the consumers' MRS equals the rate at which public and private goods 'trade off in production'.

 More of the public good could be produced by sacrificing some of the private good, and consumers will be better off.</aside>

 <br> \bigskip


<aside class="notes">To fully analyse these problems we need to know the techniques of 'mechanism design under asymmetric information', which we are not covering in this module</aside>



- Non-excludability $\rightarrow$ coordination problems $\rightarrow$ no price or suboptimal price $\rightarrow$ firms don't get the correct signals for production


. . .


- Non-rivalry $\rightarrow$ each unit provides benefit to all, consumer choices don't reflect this$\rightarrow$ firms don't get correct signals

----

### Social benefit of a private good vs a public good

- Overall value of a private good: (area under the) 'horizontal sum' of individual marginal benefit curves

    - Because 'only one person consumes each unit'

. . .


<br> \bigskip

- Public goods: 'everyone consumes the same unit'

$\rightarrow$ *aggregate* value, thus 'social marginal benefit' of public good sums *vertically*

marginal cost as the cost of providing a unit of the public good 'to everyone'

### Government's role

- Pure public goods not provided optimally by free market, i.e., voluntarily
    - although people *do* contribute to public goods, e.g., making charitable donations, for various reasons

<aside class="notes">except in really special and lucky cases</aside>



. . .


A justification for government: to enforce contributions to public goods, and make everyone better off

<aside class="notes">Adv: or, allowing heterogeneous tastes, achieve a 'potential Pareto improvement';

those who benefit could compensate those who are harmed and still all would be better off.</aside>

- **But** it's hard to determine tastes for the public good, hence difficult to determine the optimal level!


## Revealing the Demand for Public Goods (brief)


Suppose some people like fireworks, and some don't. How many should the town pay for?


. . .


i. Ask everyone to state the number of fireworks they want, and we choose the average and split costs evenly?

<aside class="notes">Q: would this work?</aside>


. . .


- $\rightarrow$ Fireworks-lovers may overstate their value to skew the average.






ii. Ask everyone to state number they want; choose average; those who stated more pay more?


. . .


- $\rightarrow$ Many people understate their value to avoid having to pay. Doh!


----

Thus:

<br> \bigskip


*Difficult or impossible to find a 'mechanism' that leads to 'truth-telling'.*


- Direct voting on each proposal also may not lead to the optimal choice

----

### Voting paradox example

Green party: Green Park $\succ$ Public housing $\succ$ Private housing \

<br> \bigskip

Labour: Public housing $\succ$ Private Housing $\succ$ Green Park \

<br> \bigskip

Conservatives: Private Housing $\succ$ Green Park $\succ$ Public housing \



. . .


\


- Suppose we have a local council with one member of each party (representing equal-sized constituencies).
- Which proposal would win if they voted on:
    - a Green park versus Public housing?
    - a Green Park versus Private housing?
    - Private housing versus Public housing?


. . .


*Does a majority vote reveal a clear 'social preference'?*

. . .

No, not here.

Typical 'Public Goods Experiment'

- Four undergraduates seated, each get \$5 'endowment'
- Told each can choose to invest none/some/all in 'group project'


. . .


\
<br> \bigskip

Each simultaneously puts \$0-\$5 in envelope (or via computer) \


Experimenter collects  'contributions', doubles total, divides it equally among group


. . .


My private benefit from this 'public good' = $\frac{1}{2}$ of total contributions,  so I only get back *half* of my own contribution

[comment]: <> (101BB)

We say the 'marginal per capita return' $(MPCR=1/2)$

[comment]: <> (101EE)

----


----

**Basic results**

- On average, subjects contribute halfway between everything and nothing

<br> \bigskip

. . .


- Contributions decline with repetition, but not to zero


. . .


<br> \bigskip

- Face to face communication improves the rate of contribution

<aside class="notes">Adv: More recent evidence finds that this decline seems to be related to issues of reciprocity, fairness and conditional cooperation.

When conditional cooperators are separated (or can self segregate) a higher level of cooperation is maintained.</aside>

###Lecture goals

(Topics in more detail)

1. What are monopolies and what are barriers to entry?
2. How do monopolies choose prices and quantities?
3. What are the social (welfare) consequences of monopoly?

. . .

4. What is 'price discrimination'?
5. what forms can price discrimination take, and how does it increase a monopoly's profits?
6. How does price discrimination affect social welfare, and whom does it help or hurt?
7. (Very brief mention: other forms of imperfect competition)

----


*Rem*: perfect competition

- free entry and exit
    - $\rightarrow$ zero long-run economic profit
- many many tiny firms
    - $\rightarrow$ firms are price takers
- $\rightarrow$ p=mc
    - And in the long run $p=ATC$ and firms produce at $min(AC)$


. . .

\

*these are extreme assumptions; theoretical ideal*

\


. . .


----

Opposite extreme: *monopoly*

- A single firm

. . .

<br> \bigskip


- Barriers to entry $\rightarrow$ No threat of entry


. . .


<br> \bigskip

- Can choose price, which becomes the 'market price'



. . .



Still, the more it charges the fewer units demanded. $\rightarrow$ Chooses a price (or quantity) where MR=MC (like all firms do)


. . .


$\rightarrow$ Produces 'less than socially optimal quantity' in order to charge a high price and increase its profit!

##Barriers to entry

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("midvale.png")
```

----

### Technical barriers to entry

- IRS/ Diminishing average cost over a broad range of output
    - $\rightarrow$ 'a natural monopoly'
    - (Here multiple firms producing separately are *less efficient producers*, cannot produce at the lowest cost)

. . .

- Debatable: Special knowledge of a low-cost method of production, or key resource

----

### Legal barriers to entry.

- Patents and copyrights

- Exclusive franchise or license (granted by government, by another firm, by a university)

- Government support for a dominant firm, discouraging/forbidding others

----

... from the 2016 Massachusetts ballot initiative?

##Monopoly profit-maximisation

- As always, set Q to maximize $QP(Q)-C(Q)$


<br> \bigskip

. . .


$\rightarrow$ optimization where $MR(Q) = MC(Q)$ (assuming $P>AC$)


. . .

<br> \bigskip

- Remember, the 'volume' benefit of increasing Q is countered by
    - Greater cost (producing more always costs more)
    - The need to reduce price (on all units) to get people to buy it

##'No supply curve for a monopoly'

- 'Supply curve': maps from p to q (and usually vice-versa) for a firm or industry
- Not *affected* by demand, only by costs and number of firms


. . .


In contrast:

- A monopoly *chooses* price (thus also choosing quantity it can sell) where $MR(q)=mc(q)$

. . .


But MR(q) depends on the demand curve slope/curvature at q,

so if demand curve changes it will affect the supply/pricing decision

[comment]: <> (101EE)

##The deadweight loss of monopoly


*Criticisms of monopoly:*

1. Monopolies produce too little output: allocatively (top-level) inefficient.

- Less output, higher price than under perfect competition


. . .


- Some of the consumer surplus under perfect competition is transferred to the monopolist.

- There is also a *deadweight loss* under monopoly

2. Redistribution from consumers to owners?

<aside class="notes">There is a redistribution of wealth from consumers to owners.

##Price discrimination

Price Discrimination

:      The practice of firms offering different prices to different consumers for the same product,




. . .


<br> \bigskip

- or different prices for slightly different *products* or quantities,
    - where the price difference *doesn't* merely reflect a production cost difference,
    - aiming to distinguish consumers' *willingness to pay* (WTP).

<aside class="notes">This includes 'volume discounts', or offering an 'all you can eat' plan alongside a per-unit plan;

 it may also include time-of-day pricing and couponing.</aside>

----

### Why do firms price discriminate?


. . .



- To increase profit
    - by 'extracting more surplus' from consumers



. . .


<br> \bigskip

**In general...**


for a monopoly firm, the ability to identify consumers based on their WTP and charge distinct prices *will* increase profit.


. . .


<br> \bigskip


... but it may increase or decrease *social* (consumer+producer) surplus

<br> \bigskip

Consumer surplus itself may increase or decrease.


----

### The alternative to price discrimination (previous analysis)

'Uniform pricing': Offering a single price for a good for all consumers.

- This does not deal with differences amongst consumers.
- 'Forces you' to target a particular group (e.g., the wealthy) reducing total sales.
- Under monopoly, this leads to a deadweight loss

 knitr::include_graphics("ppd2.png")
```

----

Price discrimination may seem counter-intuitive: 'how can offering some consumers lower prices increase profit?'



. . .


<br> \bigskip

Higher prices $\rightarrow$ greater profit per unit; but also higher price $\rightarrow$ sell fewer units.

The more you charge the less you sell.


. . .


<br> \bigskip

- Groups of 'less keen' consumers are very sensitive to price; would buy little at high price $\rightarrow$ lower price more profitable here.

- Identifiable 'keen' consumers buy a lot even at a high price. 'Less price-sensitive':  higher price more profitable here.


----

### The three types of price discrimination

1. Individual-based (First degree; at best 'perfect')

\


<aside class="notes">Targeting a price at each consumer; may be done on the internet or on a discretionary basis by an individual seller.

 'Perfect' means the seller exactly predicts and charges each consumer her valuation.</aside>


. . .


2. Self-selection (Second degree)

\



<aside class="notes">2dpd: Here the firm doesn't know each consumer's valuations,

or is not allowed to 'discriminate' by charging different prices to different people

Instead, it sells different bundles, quantities,

  or qualities of products to get high and low-value consumers to separate themselves

 E.g., first-class seats.</aside>



. . .


3. Group-based (Third degree; 'market separation')


<aside class="notes">3dpd: Here the firm finds something identifiable and inherent about the consumer

 that is indicative of her likely valuations (and price-sensitivity).

It might be her age, nationality, student-status, or even perhaps her income.</aside>


----

###First-degree and/or 'perfect' price discrimination

The firm can offer each individual a different price for each unit they purchase.


. . .


<br> \bigskip


Assuming you know what the consumer is willing to pay, you can make the *highest possible profit*; that is called 'perfect' price discrimination.


----

Perfect price discrimination
:     Charging each consumer (for each unit) the *maximum* he/she would be willing to pay, i.e., her valuation


. . .


- Here, monopolist extracts *all available surplus*; no consumer surplus remains


. . .


<br> \bigskip

- Because monopolists extract *all* the possible surplus, this is efficient
    - Because max(total value of good - cost) $\rightarrow$ max(CS+PS)

- Perfect PD is a rare/impossible extreme: requires mind reading
    - Close example: Website targets individualised price to each consumer, using clues like time-of-day, web clicks, cookie data, IP location.


<br> \bigskip

`r format_with_col("Is this 'perfect' PD?","blue")`

<br> \bigskip


. . .


- No, it isn't (see note).

### Second-degree price discrimination (self-selection)

- Firm is unable to differentiate between consumers, uses quality/quantity so consumers self-select.
    - Quality- Transport- Different classes, Supermarkets- budget products
    - Quantity- Supermarkets- Larger quantities at lower prices per unit; i.e., 'nonlinear pricing'


. . .

\


- 8 oz coffee for \pounds1.60 vs. 16 oz. for \pounds2.00
- 20 p per oz vs. 12.5p per oz.
- (with linear pricing there would be the same price of 15p/oz.)
    - Result: with 2 prices monopoly can get 'high value' consumers to buy/get more in total without losing 'low-value' consumers


----

- Similar with quality: Don't know who high-valuation flyers are (wtp for travel *itself* varies)

. . .


<br> \bigskip

- But may know on *average* that flyers with higher wtp for travel *also* value comfort more
    - Make second-class seats very uncomfortable, first-class luxurious, and charge more for first-class seats
    - Can get consumers with higher values for travel *and* comfort to pay more
    - without losing lower-valuing customers


<aside class="notes">I am not going to cover the algebra nor graphical analysis of second-degree PD, nonlinear pricing, or two-part pricing</aside>

### The 'self-selection' problem

Train companies must price first and second class such that consumers will self-select.

- If first class is too expensive then the high valuing group will not choose first class


. . .

<br> \bigskip

- If second-class is too cheap, both the high and low groups will choose second class


. . .


<br> \bigskip

- But if second class is too expensive, the low groups will not buy a ticket.

... Train companies must price first and second class such that consumers will self-select.

A 'mechanism design' problem under 'asymmetric information'; foreshadowing:

1. Choosing quantity/quality $q_h$, $q_l$ 'high-type' and low type (intended) to purchase, at prices $p_h$, $p_l$

2. Maximise expected profit (revenue for now) $\alpha p_h q_h + (1-\alpha) p_l q_l$, where $\alpha$ is the share of 'high-types'

3. Subject to constraints:
    - \underline{Incentive compatibility:} Each type $(h,l)$ must prefer their 'intended option' to the other option, given the prices AND
    - \underline{Participation:}  each must prefer the 'intended option' to not purchasing at all

### Third-degree price discrimination (3dpd)/ Group based/ Market separation

Third-degree (group-based) price discrimination
:    The practice of charging different prices to different groups that can be identified by the seller

. . .


\medskip


- The firm can differentiate *groups of consumers* or 'local markets', not individuals.
- Each group has a different willingness to pay *on average*
    -  $\rightarrow$ Offer lower prices to lower-valuing groups, higher prices to higher-valuing groups

. . .


\medskip

- Example: Students face lower prices for transport, food and other goods as they have a lower willingness to pay
    - Remember: this is *not* done out of charity but to boost profits

----

###Pricing under 3dpd/market separation

- Each group or market has it's own demand $\rightarrow$ marginal revenue curve
    - So set an optimising price quantity *separately* for each group
    - E.g., a discount for the elderly, higher price for the middle-aged
    - Or a lower price in Portugal than in Germany

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("Price-discrimination-SNP2.png")
```

----


###Who benefits from 3DPD?

- Consumers *in identifiable group* with lower wtp face lower prices, thus they benefit


. . .


- Consumers *in identifiable group* with higher wtp face higher prices, thus they lose


. . .

<br> \bigskip


- Firms can charge higher prices to high-wtp group without losing low-wtp group $\rightarrow$ increase profit


. . .


Net welfare result: theoretically uncertain


----

For consumers:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pdwelfare.png")
```

----

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='4.5in', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pdwelfareoverall.png")
```


----


###Why uncertain?

- When groups can be identified as 'low and high valuation'

    - high-valuation groups get charged more, thus consume less

    - low-valuation groups charged less, thus consume more


. . .



- $\rightarrow$ Who eats it?:  *Given what is produced*, PD causes it to be consumed by people who value it relatively less!


<br> \bigskip

*This is bad, it reduces "exchange efficiency" but...*


----



- Production: On the other hand PD can lead more to be produced/consumed

<br> \bigskip


. . .


- E.g., if with a 'uniform price' only the wealthy went to a restaurant...
    - after PD (early-bird discounts, OAP discounts, benefits discounts) the low-income may also dine in the restaurant
    - $\rightarrow$ more value is produced

<aside class="notes">Here it comes closer to perfect PD</aside>

----


- Two effects trade off: negative 'exchange efficiency' impact, potentially positive impact on production

...of the otherwise underproduced good (rem DWL of monopoly) $\rightarrow$ top-level efficiency may increase (or decrease)


. . .


- Because of the negative 'exchange efficiency effect', \underline{quantity produced} (and consumed) \underline{must increase} after PD for it to outweigh this and be beneficial in net



<br> \bigskip

Quantity increase is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.

----


###But 'arbitrage' can foil price discrimination


. . .


- If, e.g., elderly who get discounts could sell products to middle-aged...
    - Middle-aged would ask them to do this, never pay high price
    - Firm could no longer profit from this
    - Similar issues with quantity discounts, or 'web cookie' personalised pricing


. . .


- So PD only 'works' for hard-to-trade goods like haircuts
    - Or where purchases are frequent \& low-value, resale markets difficult

<aside class="notes">The above issues are sometimes referred to as 'transactions costs'</aside>


----

###David's idea: A new policy tool

- People with low-incomes tend to have lower-wtp for most goods
- Government can typically identify and verify incomes


. . .


- Governments could allow and encourage low-income consumers to get an ID indicating this
- Governments could allow and encourage firms to use this for price-discrimination


. . .

\


- Firms would increase profit
- Low-income households would benefit, reducing inequality

<br> \bigskip


. . .


- Net impact on efficiency uncertain; worth investigating


##Natural monopolies and regulation (very brief or skip)

- Where an industry involves a 'natural monopoly' (IRS) the most efficient production is a unified production process . . .
    - But if a monopoly reigns it overcharges and underprovides

. . .

<br> \bigskip

$\rightarrow$  Government may want to allow/enforce monopoly privileges but *regulate* price it can charge


- Difficulty: Government wants to regulate $p=AC$, but it doesn't know firms' actual cost function (asymmetric information)
    - Firm wants government to think it is high cost

<aside class="notes">This yields another mechanism design 'hidden information' 'principal-agent problem'</aside>

#(We may skip): IMPERFECT COMPETITION

## Brief notes on imperfect competition


With multiple firms in the same market but not complete 'free entry', theory predicts a range of possible outcomes.

1. collusion: 'patient' firms may collude to establish monopoly price, or any price above competitive price

\


<aside class="notes">recall the indefinitely-repeated prisoner's dillemma here</aside>



. . .

2. 'Cournot' competition, firms choose quantities: predicts intermediate price, between competitive \& monopoly prices


<aside class="notes">Some cool Cournot results like markups equal the inverse elasticity of demand divided by the number of firms</aside>

<aside class="notes">the related 'Stackleberg' model lets one firm choose first -- it will have a 'first-mover advantage' but still prices are intermediate</aside>

\


. . .


3. 'Bertrand' competition in prices: predicts firms compete price down to the competitive (mc) level

\


. . .


4. Product differentiation, monopolistic competition: may lead to zero long-run profits, with $p=AC>MC>$ for each firm.


<aside class="notes">When firms can differentiate their products from one another this may reduce competition.

 each firm acts as a 'local' monopoly over it's own unique product. with free entry, however, firms introduce new products which shift the demand curves inwards for the other products (substitutes), until no firm is making long run profits.</aside>

## What's up with uncertainty?


\

Previous discussion: Consumers make choices with known consequences


<aside class="notes">But in the real world many important economic decisions involve risk.</aside>

\

<br> \bigskip

. . .


Here: Choices with *unknown* consequences (but known *probabilities* of each outcome)

<aside class="notes">Adv: In the real world, people may also make choices in contexts with unknown probabilities; this is called 'ambiguity' or 'Knightian uncertainty'.

This is out of the scope of this module.</aside>

- How to consider this in the utility-max framework?
    - Standard framework: maximize 'expected utility'

`r format_with_col("Warning:","red")` 'expected utility' vs 'expected monetary value'!

<aside class="notes">Making choices to maximise expected utility is *not* the same as making choices to maximise expected monetary outcomes. This is one of the main points here. A good share of students get this mixed up!</aside>

## Probability concepts: a quick review

Probability
:     The relative frequency with which an event occurs, or can be expected to occur.

- Always between 0 and 1

<aside class="notes">Adv: There are some debates, e.g., between 'Bayesians' and 'Frequentists' over the meaning of probability.</aside>
<aside class="notes">Q: If $p$ is the probability an event occurs, what is the probability this event does *not* occur?</aside>
<aside class="notes">Ans: $1-p$</aside>

##Some probability basics (From Anne Greenbaum Wash U notes)

**Discrete RV**

A discrete random variable $X$ takes on values $x_i$ with probability $p_i$,
$i=1, \ldots, m$, where $\sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i = 1$.

. . .


<br> \bigskip

The *expected value (EV)* of a discrete random variable $X$ is defined as

$$E(X) \equiv \bar{X}  = \sum_{i=1}^m p_i x_i$$

also called the  *mean* of the random variable $X$, denoted as $\mu$.

\medskip

`r format_with_col("Also see the 'variance' and other 'moments'.","gray")`

----

**Continuous RV**


*Cumulative distribution function*:

$$ F(x) \equiv \mbox{Prob}(X < x ),$$

or the *probability density function* (pdf):

$$ f (x)\,dx \equiv \mbox{Prob}( X \in [ x, x+\,dx ] ) = F(x+\,dx ) - F(x) .$$

Letting $dx \rightarrow 0$, we find

$$ f (x) = F' (x) ,~~~F(x) = \int_{- \infty}^{x} f (t)\,dt .$$



----


The expected value  (EV) of a continuous random variable $X$ is then defined by
$$ E(X) = \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} x f (x)\,dx .$$


<br> \bigskip

Note that by definition, $\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} f (x)\,dx = 1$.

----

[comment]: <> (101EE)


Expected value (EV)
:     The 'average outcome' of an uncertain variable (general definition)



. . .


- The average monetary (or goods) payoff from an uncertain gamble


. . .


- The sum of the value at each possible outcome, weighted by the probability that outcome will occur


<aside class="notes">Adv, maths: When outcomes are in a continuous space, e.g., the returns to a stock can take any of an infinite number of possible values,

  the expected value becomes a definite integral rather than a sum.</aside>


. . .


- *Not* the same as expected utility (coming up); people need not choose the investment with the highest expected value


----

Consider: would you prefer...

a. \pounds100,000 with certainty or
b. A 1 in 10 chance of \pounds1,000,001 (and otherwise you get nothing)?

. . .

- Which has a higher expected monetary value?

<aside class="notes">Ans: $EV(b)=100,000.1>EV(a)=100,000$</aside>


. . .

- Which gives you greater expected utility?


. . .


Most people would choose certain 100k, although it has a lower *expected monetary* value. `r format_with_col("Why?","blue")`


. . .


Because they are *risk-averse*.



----


**Definitions (loose):**

1. *Risk-neutral* people always choose the option with a highest expected monetary value

\


. . .


2. *Risk-averse* people always choose a sure thing over a gamble with same expected monetary value


. . .


- Always prefer gambles with less risk, holding the expected value constant

- Always reject 'fair gambles' (see below) and prefer certainties


. . .


- To accept a (fair) gamble, must expect a 'risk-premium'



----


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("weirdalscissors.jpg")
```


. . .


3. A *Risk-lover* will always choose fair gambles over certainties, and will sometimes choose a gamble that is unfair against her




----

**Example: two possible outcomes**


<aside class="notes">Q: example of such an investment with only two outcomes?</aside>
<aside class="notes">Ans: perhaps making a loan to someone to start a business; they will either pay back the loan with a high interest, or go bankrupt and pay none of it back.</aside>

A simple investment, which either pays a low (or 0 or - amount) or a high amount


. . .



It pays X where either $X =x_1$ or $X=x_2$, where $x_1< x_2$

- Specifically, pays \pounds1020 w/ prob. 1\% \& pays \pounds10 w/ prob. 99\%





. . .


Probability it pays $x_2$ is $p$; thus probability it pays $x_1$ is?

. . .


$Pr(X=x_1)= 1-p$


. . .


The *expected (monetary) value* sums the values weighted by the probabilities, i.e., $EV(X)=(1-p) x_1 + p  x_2$

\medskip

Thus $EV(X) = 0.01 \times 1020 + 0.99 \times 10 = 10.20 + 9.90 = 20.10$


<aside class="notes">Consider: would you prefer this investment over one that paid \pounds20 with certainty? Would everyone prefer it? If not, why not?</aside>

<aside class="notes">This is the *net* expected value of buying a \$2 ticket. By this calculation each \$2 ticket is worth \$3.06 in expected value terms;

  however, with  the adjustments further down in the article, we see this drops considerably and becomes negative in net after taxes.</aside>


----

Fair gamble
:     A bet with an expected (monetary) value of zero is a 'fair gamble'

\


. . .


Actuarially fair
:     An investment whose cost is its expected value is 'actuarially fair'

----

- Which of the following are fair gambles?

    - A. 'Double or nothing' bets with a fair coin

    - B. Roulette in a casino

    - C. A gamble where you win \pounds10 with probability 1/2 and lose \pounds5 with probability 1/2

    - D. A gamble where you win \pounds10 with probability 1/4, lose \pounds5 with probability 1/2, and neither lose nor win with the remaining probability?

    - E. A stock option (without any transactions fees)

<aside class="notes">Ans: A and D; E is uncertain, but it is probably a fair gamble</aside>


## Example: experimental measures of risk attitudes (time permitting)

- Economists try to measure people's level of risk aversion in various ways
    - Revealed preference from real-world choices
    - Experimental measures, with real or hypothetical payoffs


----


One technique is the Holt and Laury (2002) risk elicitation task:

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("holtlaurie.png")
```

<aside class="notes">Asked to choose one in each row (A or B)</aside>

- Consider, when would you choose A and when would you choose B?

----

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("holtlauriedetail.png")
```

- At what point do people switch from choosing the safe to choosing the risky lottery?


. . .


- This is a measure of their risk-aversion
    - A risk-neutral person would switch to B on the fifth choice
    - The later you switch, the more risk averse

----

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("holtlauryresults.png")
```

- Results for different 'stake sizes'
    - Most people are risk-averse
    - People switch to the risky option later when stakes are higher


## Expected utility

**Note: this concept is only covered *indirectly*  in the text**

- Previous utility functions: predict choices under certainty

    - No predictions for choices with uncertain probabilistic outcomes!

- People don't maximise expected monetary value; tend to be risk-averse

----

An *Expected Utility* (EU) framework allows for risk-aversion

. . .


Assume each individual has a single function $u(Y)$ expressing their preferences over \underline{outcomes} Y `r format_with_col("called 'Von-Neumann Morgenstern' utility (VNM)","gray")`

- Similar to 'regular' utility, but here 'curvature matters'

[comment]: <> (101BB)

- With uncertainty, linear (affine) transformations of the VNM utility lead to the same behaviour; nonlinear monotonic transformations may not

[comment]: <> (101EE)

----

When making choices involving uncertainty, she does **not** (necessarily) maximise expected monetary value.

Instead, she maximises 'Expected Utility' (EU): the sum of her (VNM) valuations '$u(\cdot)$' under each outcome weighted by the *probability* of each outcome


<br> \bigskip


. . .



Risk-loving, -neutral, \& -averse individuals all max EU.  By varying the $u(\cdot)$ function we vary the implied risk preference.

----

Consider the choice between two gambles and one 'certainty':

1. Earn \pounds1,000,000 with probability 0.1 \& zero with prob. 0.9
2. Earn \pounds100,000 with probability 1/2 \& \pounds50,000 with prob. 1/2
3. Earn \pounds75,000 for certain


----

Imagine $u(y)$ arises from the *consumption chosen with* income $y$ `r format_with_col("(i.e., 'Indirect Utility')","gray")`

- Should be increasing `r format_with_col("(bc of nonsatiation)","gray")`, thus $u^\prime (y)>0$

. . .


- But may increase at a *decreasing* rate $\rightarrow$  $u^{\prime \prime}(y)<0$ <!-- \pause -->

    - This second assumption, called *diminishing marginal utility*, implies \underline{risk aversion}!

<br> \bigskip


- Or, if you are risk-neutral, it must be linear $\rightarrow$  $u(y) = a + by$, thus $u^{\prime \prime}(y)=0$

<aside class="notes">Adv: Note that when we were choosing between two goods under certainty, her *level* of total utility didn't really matter, only the relative utilities.

Now that we are considering gambles, the overall utility level matters, because we need to consider the tradeoff between 'rich and poor' states.</aside>

----

Back to the choice between two gambles and one 'certainty':

1. $Y_1$: \pounds1,000,000 with probability 0.1 and zero with prob. 0.9
2. $Y_2$: \pounds100,000 with probability 0.5 and \pounds50,000 with prob. 0.5
3. $Y_3$: \pounds75,000 for certain

. . .



<br> \bigskip


Considering each *outcome* from any of these,

we know $u(1,000,000) > u(100,000) > u(75,000)> u(50,000) > u(0)$


. . .


 ... but now the *size of the difference* in $u(y)$ matters for your decision!

<aside class="notes">Y1 vs Y3: Is 1 million 'more than ten times as good (utility-wise) as 75k?'

Y2 v Y3: Relative to 75k, does an additional 25k yield a utility gain worth the (equiprobable) loss of 25k?</aside>


----

*Example*: Suppose there is open-enrollment in Oxford, Bristol, Plymouth.


. . .


- I only need to know the *ranking* of utilities of each to know your choices.

- If you choose Oxford over Bristol, even though Oxford costs more, I can infer that for you $U(Oxford)>U(Bristol)$

----

Now suppose the policy is (you are only admitted to a single uni)

> A. Rank Oxford over Bristol and you have a 25\% chance of getting into either, and (the remaining) 50\% chance of Plymouth.

> B. Rank Bristol highest and you have a 100\% chance of getting into Bristol.


. . .


Now even if you rank Oxford $\succ$ Bristol $\succ$ Plymouth, I don't know if you will choose A or B; I would need to know the *strength* of your preferences.


. . .



If I observe you choose A I learn *more* about your utility. Your preference for Oxford over Bristol is  "stronger" than your preference for Bristol over Plymouth

Today:

EU framework predicts she chooses the option that maximizes the sum of probabilities $\times$ utilities of each outcome. For a two-outcome case:


. . .

$$EU = (1-p) u(Y_\ell) + p u(Y_h)$$

... where $p$ is the probability of the higher income $Y_h$ and $Y_\ell$ is the lower income


<aside class="notes">This is justified by certain 'reasonable axioms' we might expect choices under uncertainty to follow

although these are perhaps not as readily acceptable as the main axioms of regular utility theory (like transitivity)

... e.g., it converges to the choices made under certainty as probabilities tend to 1.

 It yields nice consistent behavior and can be reconciled with general equilibrium theory, preserving the basic welfare theorems</aside>

## Ways of reducing risk: Insurance

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("insurancereducesrisk.png")
```

Fair insurance
:     ... premium equals expected (money) value of loss

<aside class="notes">Adv: We might think that such insurance is provided at its true marginal cost;

 however there are various reasons why the cost to firms may be above this, including transactions cost, moral hazard, and adverse selection</aside>

----

Read and know (basic understanding):



- Uninsurable (difficult to insure) risks

- Adverse selection

- Moral hazard

- The rationale for insurance 'deductibles'


## Ways of reducing risk: Diversification

- Diversification: Buying multiple assets

    - With risks that are not perfectly correlated with one another


. . .



<br> \bigskip


Putting your eggs in multiple baskets: tends to reduce risk, for a given expected value of profit (or loss)

----

### Illustration: Binomial distribution



Suppose I've \pounds 1000, and can bet on fair coin flips $\rightarrow$ My returns have a 'binomial distribution'.



. . .


A. Bet all \pounds 1000 in a single flip $\rightarrow$ 50\% chance I'll lose (or double) my entire investment.


. . .


B. Bet \pounds 500 on 2 flips $\rightarrow$ 25% chance I'll lose (or double) investment.  `r format_with_col("Better?","blue")`


. . .


$EV(A)=EV(B)=1000$ but B is "less risky" $\rightarrow$ $B \succ A$ if you're risk averse


<aside class="notes">Less risky: B and A overlap with 0.5 probability; remaining 50\% of time A's outcomes are more extreme</aside>



. . .


C. \pounds100 each in 10 flips,  there's a 38\% chance that I'll lose 20\% or more of my investment.

D. \pounds1 each on on 1000 flips $\rightarrow$ 6\% chance I lose 5% of my investment or more; 1/10th of 1\% chance I'll lose 10\%+.


. . .

*Result*: More 'diversification' $\rightarrow$  less risk, for same EV.

----


*Result*: The more I can do this 'diversification', the less risk I face.



*Note*: For simplicity, above examples have a 'fair coin flip', zero expected-return investment.


<br> \bigskip


. . .


But: 'why invest at all? Because this principle also applies to 'unfair coin flips'.


. . .


E.g., investments in the stock market are more profitable on average than money under the mattress.

<aside class="notes">Each \pounds1 invested in shares has a higher expected return, but also a higher risk.

 However by spreading across *many different* assets we can reduce this risk, as seen above</aside>




----

### Example

You've \pounds35k, must invest \pounds15k in an Oil or Transportation firm. A share in either costs \pounds1 (alt: costs \pounds0.9).

<aside class="notes">Alt: suppose it costs \pounds0.9, so on average it is profitable</aside>


. . .


By EOY, 50\% chance price $\uparrow$ to \pounds2, 50\% chance $\downarrow$ to \pounds0.


1. Put it all in one firm $\rightarrow$ 50\% chance you'll end up with \pounds20k, 50% chance of \pounds50k. EV = \pounds35k.


. . .


2.  If you put half in each you've a 25\% chance of each of ...:


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("oiltransitperformance.png")
```

Same expected value, but it's 'better'

<aside class="notes">Draw histograms on the board</aside>

----

*Why better* (for a risk-averse person)?

\medskip

*Less risk, same EV*: 50\% of the time (when oil \& transit move opposite) you've less gain/loss than if undiversified.


. . .


I.e., comparing distribution of returns vs. undiversified investment:

- 25\% of time, gain 0 vs. \pounds15K (leaving you \pounds35k vs. \pounds50k)

- 25\% of time, gain 0 vs. lose \pounds15K (leaves \pounds35k vs. \pounds20k)


. . .


- Remaining 50\% of time (both rise/both fall) ... same as remaining 50\% of the time under undiversified investment

## Flexibility and options contracts


`r format_with_col("Keep your options open' (simple idea)","gray")`

`r format_with_col("'Real option': an option outside the financial world","gray")`

. . .

Option contract

:     Financial contract offering the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell an asset over a specified period (at a certain price).



. . .

Attributes of options:

1. Specification of \underline{transaction}: what is bought/sold, how many units maximum, at what price, etc
2. \underline{Period} the option may be exercised (from when until when)
3. \underline{Price} of the option

----

### Price of options determined by

1. EV of underlying transaction

. . .


2. Variability of the value of the transaction


. . .


Ex: Option G ('call option'): Right to buy Google share at \pounds500 (\pounds500 'strike price') between Jan. 2018 and Dec. 2020


. . .


- Worth more the higher the current share price

- If $P_{google}<\pounds500$ currently, then option G is worth more the higher the expected *variability* in $P_{google}$. `r format_with_col("Why?","blue")`



. . .



Bc variability can only help option-holder: price $\uparrow$ $\rightarrow$ profit, but if price falls below \pounds500, she doesn't need to exercise option

----

Price of options determined by 1. EV of underlying transaction, 2. Variability of this value, and...



3. Duration: the longer the better. `r format_with_col("(Why?)","blue")`


. . .


- Greater chance the price will rise above strike price (\pounds500)


<aside class="notes">Results for 'right to sell = call options' are similar, just replace the words 'buy' with 'sell' and reverse the directions ('rise' with 'fall), etc.</aside>

----

Options can be used for *hedging risk* ... that was their original purpose. `r format_with_col("How","blue")`?

<aside class="notes">Q1 How might an airline buy options to counter its risk from rising petrol prices?

Q2. How could an airline pilot buy options to counter her risk of being fired in case her airline goes out of business?

But always priced at least as high as intrinsic value, because you *can* cash it in now.</aside>

<aside class="notes">Ans: 1. The airline could buy call options (rights to buy at a price) for oil and gas company shares, or for oil and gas commodity units.

2. The pilot could buy put options (rights to sell at a price) in the airline she works for; if the airline shares become worthless these put options will be very valuable.

Classic economist's argument: you should 'bet against yourself' to minimise risk; but this might give you bad incentives to perform.

See column about this [HERE](http://www.marketplace.org/2008/08/11/business/hedging-your-bets-hard-times "Hedging your bets in hard times")
</aside>

<aside class="notes">This sort of thing could be asked as an exam question, perhaps multiple choice</aside>


----

### Black-Scholes (and Merton) model of options value


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='75%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("optionsvalue_blackscholes.png")
```

<aside class="notes">Above is for option that can be executed from now indefinitely into the future.

Not of infinite value because future payoffs are discounted at risk-free rate.

Blue is value that can be 'cashed in', red is Black-Scholes calculation.

Red always above the blue because 'asset's price may increase'.

At very low asset price it is unlikely the price will rise above \$100 in forseeable future, so not valuable.

At prices higher and higher above strike price of \$100 the red and blue come closer together, because it's unlikely

the asset price goes below \$100 any time soon, so option is almost the same as an actual share.

But always priced at least as high as intrinsic value, because you *can* cash it in now.</aside>


- \footnotesize{Insightful; once developed, traders *used it* to price options}
- \footnotesize{Problem: It's just a model, makes fairly strong assumptions (normal distribution of returns, etc.)}

<aside class="notes">Unlike, e.g., value of continuously compounded interest, we still don't *know* true value of options</aside>

- \footnotesize{Different preferences for risk versus \underline{expected} (average) return}
- \footnotesize{'Risk' is the overall variance around the average}
- \footnotesize{Assumes 'optimal diversification': no one chooses points *below* market line}

----

**Extension: 'Capital asset pricing model' (CAPM)**

CAPM: Leading 'baseline' model in finance,  assumes investors optimally diversify


. . .


Thus assets are priced based only on 'risk that cannot be diversified away from' ('market risk')


. . .


- Holding EV of dividends constant, assets with higher *market risk* are less desirable, thus priced lower, and get higher returns

- The trade-off between this risk and return has a linear relationship with slope 'Beta'

Suppose there is a 50-50 chance that a risk averse individual with a current wealth of \pounds20,000 will contract a debilitating disease and suffer a loss of \pounds10,000.

a) Calculate the cost of actuarially fair insurance in this situation and use a utility-of-income graph to show that the individual will prefer fair insurance against this loss to accepting the gamble uninsured.

...

b) Suppose two types of insurance policies were available: 1. A fair policy covering the complete loss and 2. A fair policy covering only half of any loss incurred.

\

Calculate the cost of the second type of policy and show that the individual will generally regard it as inferior to the first.
\

<!---
c) Suppose individuals who purchase cost-sharing policies of the second type take better care of their health, thereby reducing the loss suffered when ill to only \pounds7,000. In this situation, what will be the cost of a cost-sharing policy? Show that some individuals may now prefer this type of policy. (This is an example of the moral hazard problem in insurance theory.)

<aside class="notes">Don't complain 'I don't think players will max payoffs, bc they also care about how others do, etc.'

Whatever it is they care about can be expressed in the theoretical payoffs.

## Equilibrium

. . .


<br> \bigskip

\

Similar concept for strategic settings:

Nash equilibrium (NE)
:     A set (i.e., 'profile') of *strategies*, one for each player, that are best responses against one another


----

Nash equilibrium (NE)
:     A set ('profile') of *strategies*, one for each player, that are best responses against one another


If I play my BR to your chosen strategy and you're playing your BR to mine, neither of us has an incentive to deviate --- an equilibrium.


. . .


All games have at least one Nash equilibrium

- But it may be an equilibrium in 'mixed strategies' (involving randomisation)


. . .


Caveat: we might not expect such play to actually occur (particularly not in one-shot games)


<aside class="notes">In fact, 2-player games will have an *odd* number of equilibria; you can see this by looking at the crosses of the BR functions</aside>

## Two ways to find the Nash equilibrium (NE)

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pd_normal.png")
```

*First method: Inspection*

Check each outcome.


. . .

<br> \bigskip


Either player has incentive to *unilaterally* deviate?


. . .


<br> \bigskip

If not $\rightarrow$ it's (outcome of) a NE.


----


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pd_normal.png")
```

*Second method to find NE --  Underlining*

. . .

<br> \bigskip

Underline payoffs for BR's of each player.


. . .

<br> \bigskip

Outcome with 2 underlines $\rightarrow$ `r format_with_col("outcome of","gray")` a NE (strat. profile).





<aside class="notes">Caveat: works in a game with a countable set of actions ... a 'matrix' game

If the actions are a continuous variable (e.g., price, quantity) you must solve for point(s) where these functions meet</aside>

----


Find equilibrium via each method:


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

```


<aside class="notes">Note this is the same 'prediction' as dominant strategies, but the interpretations are different;

This is not by accident, there is a general result...</aside>

<aside class="notes">Recall again that the NE, and the prediction of 'players play dominant strategies' (also 'rationalisability')

yields the single outcome that is clearly NOT pareto optimal. Lesson  group and individual interests don't always align</aside>

## Relationship between dominant strategies, rationalisability, and Nash equilibrium

If eliminating dominated strategies yields a single prediction for each player, these form a NE (profile).


. . .

<br> \bigskip


Same for ISD (rationalizability) ...
if it leads to a unique prediction, it's a NE.


. . .


<br> \bigskip

HOWEVER: not every NE involves dominant strategies


<!---
## Efficiency and the PD
*Lesson: group and individual interests don't always align*
- If the players could communicate what would seem to be the best outcome?
. . .
- Both cooperating (silent) better for both than the outcome in NE: 2 yrs vs. 3 yrs (R vs P)
    - But binding agreements not allowed, and communication shouldn't help

Pure strategy
:     Consists of a single action played with certainty

Mixed strategy

*Remember: there is always at least one NE. If there is no pure strategy NE, there will be a NE in mixed strategies.*

----

### Matching pennies: mixed strategies

\underline{Intuition}

- If you choose heads/tails half the time then I'm indifferent between heads or tails
    - choosing heads half the time is *among* my best responses

. . .


- If I choose heads half the time then you're indifferent between heads/tails
    - choosing heads half the time is *among* your best responses

### What's all this rot?


. . .



Mixed strategies are not about 'being unpredictable'; these are one shot games

<aside class="notes">Adv: Some texts and authors make this point about 'unpredictability' but others disagree (including myself).
Making sure that it is impossible to predict your later play from your previous is only important if you are playing the same game repeatedly, and being observed.</aside>

. . .


It makes a bit more sense if we think about 'populations'

. . .


- Suppose in a population 1/3 of men go to Ballet and 2/3 of women go to Ballet:
- ... these ratios are 'stable'; no reason for systematic changes.


. . .


- On the other hand, if men always went to boxing and women to ballet this is not stable
- A husband would be better off going to ballet ... so the ratios should change over time.


----

###Computing payoffs with mixing

Formally NE specifies *strategies* (strategy 'profiles') not payoffs

\


. . .


\


In the BOS the pure strategy equilibria were

- i. Husband: Boxing, Wife: Boxing
- ii. Husband: Ballet, Wife: Ballet

. . .

\


The mixed-strategy NE was:

- iii. Husband: go Ballet with probability h=1/3, Wife: Go Ballet with prob w=2/3.


. . .

\


The *payoffs* to these were, respectively

- i. Husband: 2, Wife: 1
- ii. Husband: 1, Wife: 2
- iii. ...

----

Payoff to the mixed strategy: simple EU computations, see handout (work on your own)

<!---
- Payoffs are utilities, sum utility of each outcome $\times$ probability of that outcome
    - Prob(Both go Ballet) = $w \times h = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$
    - Prob(Both go Boxing) = $(1-w)(1-h) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$
    - Prob(Wife Ballet, Husband Boxing) = $w(1-h) = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{9}$
    - Prob(Wife Boxing, Husband Ballet) = $(1-w)(h) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$
    -->


<!---
Thus, under the mixed strategy NE play:
$$U_{husb} =  \frac{2}{9} \times 1 +  \frac{2}{9} \times 2 +  \frac{4}{9} \times 0 + \frac{1}{9} \times 0 = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$$
$$U_{wife} = \frac{2}{3}$$
<br> \bigskip
`r format_with_col("Wife's payoff inferred from symmetry of problem or similarly calculated","gray")`
-->

It turns out:

$$U_{husb} =  \frac{2}{9} \times 1 +  \frac{2}{9} \times 2 +  \frac{4}{9} \times 0 + \frac{1}{9} \times 0 = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$$

and same for the Wife's payoffs.

### How do you solve a problem like multiple-equilibria? (WIP)

[LINK](https://youtu.be/OvsNgQS_Qa8?t=40)

There's always one or more they say but sometimes it is mixed \
you find one where the best reponses meet at some point fixed \
you only know you won't regret the strategies it 'picksed' \
I hear that it's prediction power is shabby

\medskip

It might not yield the best outcome and might not yield the worst \
In prisoner's dillemas a confession is coerced, \
I hate to have to say it, but I very firmly feel Nash Equilibrium's not an asset to the abbey \

I have to say a word on its behalf: multiple-equilibria make me laugh

## So,

How do you solve a problem like multiple-equilibria?

- How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
    - How do choose among the multiple-equilibria?
    - A flibbertjibbet! A will-o'-the wisp! A clown!


Many a thing you'd like old Nash to tell you \
Many a thing you thought you'd understand \
But how do you find a way to predict equilibrium play? \

## Multiple equilibrium and refinements

We refer to *refinement criteria* and *focal points*

- Equilibrium with the highest payoffs for both?
    - In BOS this rules out mixing (payoffs 2/3, 2/3 for h,w respectively)
    - But doesn't say whether it's Box, Box (payoffs 2,1) or Ballet, Ballet (payoffs 1,2)


. . .


- Choose the 'symmetric equilibrium?' ... here, mixing


. . .


- Choose the one that seems like a 'focal point'? (rem, the 'big game')

## Repeated games: definite time horizon




[comment]: <> (101BB)

2018: limited coverage

[comment]: <> (101EE)

A 'stage game' is a simple (matrix) game that may be played repeatedly


. . .


- Definite horizon: play stage game a *known* and finite number of times

`r format_with_col("Note:","red")` In repeated (as in sequential) games, a strategy is a 'complete contingent plan'; specifies what the player will choose at *every* decision node

##A general rule for (finitely) repeated games


Whenever the stage-game is repeated, repeated play of the stage-game equilibrium is an equilibrium of this repeated game


. . .


- In a *finitely-repeated* Prisoner's dilemma this is the *only* equilibrium

<aside class="notes">This is the case for any stage game with only a single equilibrium

 For games with multiple stage-game equilibria there may be repeated game equilibria involving different play in some stages; not discussed here.</aside>

----


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("pd_normal.png")
```

Is there a way in which we can sustain cooperation in a finitely repeated Prisoners' Dilemma?


. . .


<br> \bigskip


No.

<aside class="notes">PUT THE PAYOFFS on the board</aside>


----

Suppose we repeat the Prisoners' Dilemma a finite (T) number of times, e.g., 10 times.

. . .


What is the subgame perfect equilibrium?


. . .


\medskip


\underline{Backwards induction:}

- In period 10 (period T) both confess as it's the dominant strategy

. . .


- In period 9 (period T-1)
    - Knowing period 10 (period T) decision is unaffected by earlier moves, players confess in period 9 (their dominant strategy)


. . .


- ... etc, all the way back to period 1


. . .


Thus each Confesses in every period $\rightarrow$ Can't sustain cooperation.


## Repeated Games: Indefinite or infinite time horizon (mathematically equivalent)

- Game played repeatedly for potentially infinite number of periods


. . .


- But there is a 'discount factor' $g$


. . .


- $g$ may instead represent 'probability the game is repeated another time'

<aside class="notes">With an infinitely-repeated game with no discounting, payoffs would be potentially infinite, making it hard to decipher.

 It's realistic to imagine people discount the future, and we don't know how long these repeated interactions last; people die, move away, etc.</aside>

----

### Trigger strategies

Trigger strategy
:     Strategy in a repeated game where one player stops cooperating in order to punish another player for not cooperating.


. . .


<br> \bigskip


Grim trigger strategy
:     If other player fails to cooperate in one period, play the (undominated) strategy that makes the other player worst off in all later periods

----


**Indefinitely repeated Prisoners' Dilemma**

Consider the following trigger strategy (for both players):

- Stay silent as long as the other player stays silent.
- If one player confesses, both players will confess from them on.


. . .


Is this a SPNE?


. . .


- In each subgame after someone confesses, we play confess in all stage games (forever on), which we know is a NE

. . .


- What about periods where no one has confessed (yet)?

<aside class="notes">How do we know both players playing 'confess forever' is a SPNE?

Starting in any subgame,  knowing the other player will confess, I will want to confess (for that period's payoffs).

I also know that given his strategy, playing 'silent' in  this period will not have any impact on my later payoffs.</aside>




----


The payoff from staying Silent (cooperating) each period is:

$$-2 \times (1 + g + g^2 + g^3 + . . . )$$

. . .


The payoff from Confessing right away (after which both players Confess always) is:

$$ -1 + -3 \times (g + g^2 + g^3 + . . . ) $$

. . .

Formula for a geometric series (where $0<g<1$): $g + g^2 +  g^3 + g^4 ... = g/(1-g)$



<aside class="notes">Maths: The standard derivation of this, which is pretty neat, is in the text.

This formula is an important one in economics (and beyond),

 particularly for discounting a constant stream of payoffs, e.g., stock dividends</aside>

----

Thus cooperation in a single period is 'weakly preferred' (at least as good) if


$$(-2) \times (1 + g + g^2 + g^3 + . . . ) \geq (-1) + -3 \times (g + g^2 + g^3 + . . .)$$

. . .

$$g + g^2 + g^3 + . . . \geq 1$$

<aside class="notes">Intuition for the second formula: left side is loss of future payoffs (-3 vs -2 forever from next period).

 Right side is gain in that period (get -1 rather than -2))</aside>

. . .

$$g/(1-g) \geq 1$$

. . .

$$g \geq \frac{1}{2}$$


. . .


$\rightarrow$  cooperation can be sustained if the 'probability of play continuing' (or 'patience')  is high enough; here, above 1/2.

<aside class="notes">Just because it can be sustained doesn't mean it will; there are other Subgame-Perfect Nash equilibria, including 'always confess'.</aside>

<aside class="notes">This setup is directly applied to the case of 'a cartel' of firms tacitly or overtly colluding to sustain high prices!</aside>

[comment]: <> (pre2018BB)

## Continuous Actions

GT for cases where people choose 'continuous' actions, e.g.:

. . .


- Firms choose product price or quantity, or a level of R\&D, etc.

[comment]: <> (101BB)

E.g., $q_i \in [0,\infty]$ for $i=1,...n$ firms

[comment]: <> (101EE)


. . .


- Households voluntarily contribute to local public good (e.g., neighborhood watch)
     - or choose how many fish to catch from the shared pond


. . .


- Nations: How large an army to build

<aside class="notes">As you can see from mock exams etc., GT with continuous actions IS something I may test you on!</aside>


----

`r format_with_col("With continuous actions...","gray")`

<br> \bigskip

$\rightarrow$ Payoff functions, continuous 'best response functions'; rather than a payoff matrix

. . .


- Nash equilibrium: Again, choices that are best responses to one another


. . .


- Dominant strategies: Again, a strategy that is preferred against *any* other player(s)' strategies

<aside class="notes">Here the iterated dominance or 'rationalizability' is harder to compute; we won't cover this</aside>

[comment]: <> (101BB)

----


Continuous games with differentiable payoffs, finding NE:

1. Write down payoff functions. (Differentiable?)

2. Max each player’s payoff wrt own strategy; other player's payoff as a 'parameter' $\rightarrow$ Players' best-response functions.

3. Look for intersection(s) $\rightarrow$ Nash equilibrium/equilibria

### Tragedy of the Commons

Shepherds A \& B graze $s_A$ \& $s_B$ sheep, respectively, in same meadow


. . .


More sheep graze $\rightarrow$ less grass for each $\rightarrow$ less wool/milk/meat per sheep


. . .


Benefit per sheep raised: $120-s_A-s_B$


. . .


<br> \bigskip


*Total* benefit from raising $s_A$ and $s_B$ sheep:

- Shepherd A: $s_A(120-s_A-s_B)$
- Shepherd B: $s_B(120-s_A-s_B)$

. . .


\medskip


*Marginal* benefit of 'me adding' another sheep:

- Shepherd A: $120-2s_A-s_B$
- Shepherd B: $120-s_A-2s_B$


<aside class="notes">BEEM101: covered in tutorial</aside>


----

For simplicity, assume zero marginal cost

\

Set MB=MC (here MC=0)

- Shepherd A: $120-2s_A-s_B = 0$
- Shepherd B: $120-s_A-2s_B = 0$


. . .


<br> \bigskip


Rearrange above to solve for BRFs:

- Shepherd A:  $s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$
- Shepherd B:  $s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A$


----

Solve for Nash equilibrium:


$$s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$$


. . .


Plug this value of $s_A$ into the BRF for B, solve for $s_B$, then for $s_A$

$$s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A = 60 - \frac{1}{2}(60-\frac{1}{2} s_B)$$



. . .


$s_A* = s_B* = 40$


----

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.height='2.35in', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

Shepherd A:  $s_A = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_B$

\medskip

Shepherd B: $s_B = 60-\frac{1}{2} s_A$


. . .


\medskip

$\rightarrow s_A* = s_B* = 40$



----

**Why the 'Tragedy' of the Commons?**


. . .



\footnotesize{Each grazes until his *private* marginal benefit equals his cost (0):}

- $120-2s_A-s_B = 0$


. . .


\footnotesize{Does not consider the harm he imposes on the other guy}


. . .


Above, $s_A* = s_B* = 40$. Each get payoff $40 \times (120 - 40 - 40) = 40 \times 40 = 1600$
 \

. . .

\footnotesize{To max *total* payoffs, set} $S=s_A+s_B$ \footnotesize{to max}
$$S\times(120-S)$$


. . .

\footnotesize{Concave problem, set first-derivative to zero:}
$$120 - 2S = 0 \rightarrow S^*=60$$


. . .

\footnotesize{Leading to total payoff $60 \times (120 - 60) = 3600$. If split evenly (each graze 30), get 1800 each.}


<aside class="notes">This is the 'continuous action' analogue of the Prisoner's dilemma</aside>


<aside class="notes">Both the PD and the above 'tragedy of the commons' game illustrate a similar point:

 Individuals acting in their own private interest may end up each doing worse off than if they could cooperate or collude.</aside>

## Laboratory evidence 2: Ultimatum game

Proposer goes first, proposes split of the 'pie', anything between 0\%-100\% and 100\%-0\% inclusive.

. . .


Responder can accept, or reject and get nothing

<aside class="notes">Q: What does SPNE predict (use backwards induction)?</aside>

<aside class="notes">Ans: It predicts the proposal offers the lowest (positive) amount and the responder accepts</aside>


. . .


What happens in experiments?


. . .


- Most common offer: 50-50 split
- Responders: Often reject offers of less than 30\% (even when it's a lot of money)


. . .


Potential explanations

- Fairness concerns; monetary payoffs may not be *actual* payoffs

. . .

- Proposers may anticipate this



## Issues in lab experiments

### What is being measured?

PD: Does money measure the true payoffs? Do we have the 'control' to test the model?

. . .


- Other-regarding preferences; may be unobservable.
- 'Experimenter demand': desire to please experimenter, aware of study goals?


## Issues in lab experiments: External generalisability

1. Relevance of subject-pool (participants)

- Do they resemble the 'real world' group of interest? (e.g., firms, countries, taxpayers, voters, home-buyers)

- Right preferences and experience?


. . .


2. Relevance of environment

- Are the (small) stakes relevant?

- Are the right 'environmental characteristics' present?


. . .


- Does the 'imposed model' apply?

- Observed self-conscious environment, perhaps made aware of contrasts

#Additional lecture: Asymmetric information

##Asymmetric information

* Market failures: Asymmetric information** (Moral hazard, adverse selection, signaling)


Asymmetric information: one party to a transaction has more information than the other party.

See separate notes on VLE; brief summary below


##Principal-Agent Problem

Principal (P) 'hires' agent (A) to perform a task; A has private information, either about her actions or her type.

- Employer-employee relationship:

- Employer (principal); employee (agent)

- A worker has full information about whether she is working hard (action) or her job skills (type).

- How does an employer monitor/influence effort?  How does a potential employee signal their high quality type?

----

**Moral hazard** problem occurs when an agent’s action is private information

- Offering incentives may be costly (because of limited liability, risk aversion, and difficulties in writing contracts)

**Hidden information** ('privacy') problem occurs when an agent’s type is private information.

- 'Lemons problem' $\rightarrow$ potential **Adverse selection** and/or closing down of markets

- Principal/agent $\rightarrow$ 'distorted' output or quality for 'less favored' type to reduce 'information rent' for 'better' type


----


Automobile insurance

- When selling a policy the company does not know whether you are a high risk or low risk driver (adverse selection)

- Since you are insured you are less careful (moral hazard)

##Moral hazard: Basic principles (see flowchart)

1. If 'effort' (or honesty) unobserved, principal (P) must offer incentives based on *observed performance* or *output*.

<!-- \pause -->

2. If output has (uncontrollable) *random component*, rewarding output shifts risk to the *agent* (A).

- If A more risk-averse than P, output-compensation $\rightarrow$ inefficient risk bearing.

- Cost of paying 'risk premium' to A $\rightarrow$ P may demand less effort than is efficient

...

----

3. Otw, if P \& A have same risk-attitude, P can 'sell the profits to A' $\rightarrow$ efficiency

- But not if A has 'limited liability' $\rightarrow$ inefficiency:
    - P can only 'reward' A not 'punish' her $\rightarrow$ costly $\rightarrow$ demand less effort

##Lemons problem

*Where sellers know more about the value of (e.g.) used cars than buyers, some sales that would be mutually beneficial will not take place.*

<!-- \pause -->

Easiest model:

- Car quality $x$ distributed $x \sim U(0,1)$.
/deman
- Buyer values at $\frac{3}{2}x$, seller values it at $x$ (so efficiency requires trade!)

- Seller proposes 'tioli' price $p$

<!-- \pause -->

$\rightarrow$ Seller must choose $p \geq x$ $\rightarrow E(x|p)=\frac{1}{2}x$ $\rightarrow$

<!-- \pause --> Buyer anticipates value $\frac{3}{2}\frac{1}{2}p=\frac{3}{4}p$

Buyer never accepts any price $\rightarrow$ market closes down

(20 marks) In this module we discussed four major ways in which behavioural economists argue that people diverge from classical assumptions. Explain two of these departures from the classical assumptions. For TWO of these major departures, give a specific example of such behaviour, and briefly describe the nature of the evidence for this, and explain one behavioural economics model explaining this behaviour.

Note the question is asking:

In this module we discussed four major ways in which behavioural economists argue that people diverge from classical assumptions.

1. Explain two of these [behavioural economics] departures from the classical assumptions.


2. For TWO of these major departures [both of them!],
    1. give a specific example of such behaviour, and
    2. briefly describe the nature of the evidence for this, and
    3. explain one behavioural economics model explaining this behaviour.

## Neoclassical versus Behavioural economics

**(Neo)classical assumptions/focus:**

Firms max profit


. . .

Individuals/households: act to max a CONSISTENT/CONSTANT utility function, mainly 'own consumption'



. . .


- MAXIMISATION st known (budget) constraints

- No 'cognitive costs' nor calculation costs


<aside class="notes">*Preferences* cannot themselves be irrational,

but ppl may not be acting optimally to max their welfare *given* their preferences OR

their preferences be internally inconsistent (e.g., not-transitive), not fully self-interested (altruism),

 or are otw difficult to model (e.g., depending on the *manner* they make choices and not only the outcomes.</aside>


----

`r format_with_col("Classical economics assumes","gray")`


. . .


EU over gambles/investments (probabilities accurately known)

<aside class="notes">Mainly ignores 'malleable and changing preferences'</aside>



----



Optimisation of consistent 'normal' utility function s.t. known constraints


. . .


- Only own consumption matters?

- No cost to gather information or calculate?


. . .


- 'Geometric discounting of future payoffs', consistent (*) rate $\delta$


<aside class="notes">Adv: E.g., if $\delta=0.1$ in each period then next period's payoff of 100 is worth as much as $(1-0.1) \times 100 = 90$  today.

A payoff of 100 in two periods is worth as much as $(1-0.1) \times 100 = 90$ tomorrow, or as much as $(1-0.1) \times (1-0.1)\times 100 = 81$ today.</aside>

<aside class="notes">Strictly, it need not be a *constant* rate but it must be consistent in a particular sense</aside>


. . .


- Strategic behaviour in interactions: Common knowledge of rationality, ?maybe convergence to equilibrium


----

We can find behaviour and outcomes that seem to contradict the above assumptions.



\

This 'non-classical' behaviour is (arguably) common, significant, and follows predictable patterns

\



Should we *stop learning classical economics?*



----


##Classical economists are not naive

They know preferences change, people make mistakes, etc.

\



Justifications:

- 'Most people, most of the time,' and many mistakes will be 'fixed' by the market.

- Predictive power


<aside class="notes">Or is this just driven by our cognitive dissonance, motivated reasoning, and 'sunk-cost' fallacy?</aside>

. . .


- 'Normative':  how we 'should' behave to get the best outcomes

- A starting point, framework for insight, benchmark

----

##Behavioural Economics

Relaxes some of the assumptions above, usually one at a time





<br> \bigskip

Doesn't 'reject rationality': '*bounded* rationality'
\





<br> \bigskip

Most 'behavioral models' involve optimisation `r format_with_col("and often equilibrium","gray")`

<aside class="notes">There are 'pure behavioral theorists' who try to find parsimonious models to explain deviations</aside>


. . .

\


- Most influential authors: Kahneman and Tversky



. . .


- Least influential author: Reinstein



----

##Modern consensus/entente

Both classical and behavioural economics are useful

- Different models and techniques (for different spheres?)

<aside class="notes">
- It is worth testing for, and admitting the possibility of 'systematic violations' of the classical assumptions

- Classical may (or may not) predict well for *aggregates* and for *firm behaviour*

- Behavioural models may predict better for individual behaviour in isolation

    - but behavioural admits many possibilities and heterogeneous behavior, so it makes broad predictions difficult

    - but behavioural insights are (probably) useful in making policy (and in marketing)

- Evidence from the lab may be informative, but some 'behavioural anomalies' may be inconsequential in larger markets in equilibrium

    </aside>

##Limits to Human Decision Making: An Overview

There are four general ways people diverge from classical assumptions (text says three)

1. Limited cognitive ability --- difficult and costly to make complex decisions


. . .


2. Limited willpower --- self control problems


. . .


3. Limited self interest --- care about others (fairness, altruism), issues beyond income/consumption


. . .


4. Inconsistent, changing, and 'non-outcome-based' preferences

<aside class="notes">DR: I added this one; under (e.g.) Prospect Theory people may be acting to maximise their true preferences,

 but their true preferences may change depending on reference points etc.</aside>

## Limited cognitive ability

Complex problems

Optimising calculations take time;  *itself* costly



. . .


$\rightarrow$  'simplifying decision-making rule' (rule-of-thumb) may be better


. . .


- Relevant both to individual decision-making (consumption, investment) and strategic choices

    - Game theory:  'iterated strict dominance', 'backwards induction'

. . .


- People (seem to) systematically misunderstand probabilities, maths

- $r$ may be ex-ante expectation or the modal outcome or ??

- one possibility: $L(x,r)=-(x-r)^{1/2}$; loss increases at a *decreasing* rate
    - so willing to risk a larger loss to avoid a small loss

`r format_with_col("Grasshopper","olive")` weights payoffs today, tomorrow, and every day the same: $\delta=1$

- Monday, `r format_with_col("Grasshopper","olive")` compares Work to Lazy, and chooses Work.
    - payoff(Work) $= -10 + (2 \times 6) = 2$
    - payoff(Lazy) $= -5 + (1 \times 6) = 1$

. . .

`r format_with_col("Ant","brown")`, every day weights payoffs at 1 'today' \& $1/2$ for any future day (so $\delta=1$ and $\beta=1/2$)

- Monday, Ant chooses Lazy:
    - payoff(Work) $= -10 +(2 \times 6)\times \frac{1}{2} = -4$
    - payoff(Lazy) $= -5 + (1 \times 6)\times {1}{2} = -2$

----

If `r format_with_col("Grasshopper","olive")` were 'choosing for Monday on Sunday', he would choose Work $\rightarrow$ Consistent

. . .


But if `r format_with_col("Ant","brown")` were 'choosing for Monday on Sunday', he would also choose Work
. . .

- On Sunday he considers
    - payoff(Work Monday) $= (-10 + 2 \times 6)\times \frac{1}{2} = 1$
    - payoff(Lazy Monday) $= (-5 + 1 \times 6)\times \frac{1}{2} = 1/2$


. . .

- But as we saw, on Monday he chooses to be lazy  $\rightarrow$ Inconsistent

- Would he 'benefit from pre-committing?'

## Altruism and fairness

*'Other-regarding preferences':*  My utility may be impacted by...


. . .


Other people's utility, or their consumption of 'merit' goods


. . .


- E.g., I suffer if I know my neighbour suffers, or her child eats too little

- $\rightarrow$ 'aid to the poor' may become a public good; may be massively under-provided in a voluntary setting

----


`r format_with_col("'Other-regarding preferences':  My utility may be impacted by...","gray")`

My perceived 'impact' on outcomes

- If I donate to charity, I feel better
- If my contribution improves people's lives, protects the environment (relative to my having done nothing)

. . .


<br> \bigskip

- $\rightarrow$ People may make choices reducing their own consumption, to increase other's consumption

. . .

Charitable giving widespread; about 1\% of UK GDP. 'Donations' to family members much higher

Where earnings are unequal, player-1 gets 9 and player-2 gets 1 from material payoffs.

But because of a difference of 8 in earnings, both players lose 8 in psychological payoffs

so the net real payoffs if player-1 offered 1 and 2 accepted would be 9-8=1 for player-1 and 1-8=-7 for player-2.

Using BWI here we see the subgame perfect NE will be that player-1 offers 5 and player-2 accepts.</aside>

Because of this she will not accept such an offer. Knowing this, player-1 will offer 5.</aside>

##Supplemental (reading): Evidence on the Ultimatum Game


Guth et al. (1982) presented the first experimental test of the ultimatum game.

<br> \bigskip
2 players: Proposer and Responder

<br> \bigskip
Proposer has a pie of size 1. She must propose a split of the pie between the two players $(1-s, s)$

. . .


<br> \bigskip
The Responder may:

- accept (in which case the split is executed)
- reject (in which case both players get zero


----

This is a 'take it or leave it offer' in bargaining.


. . .

<br> \bigskip


- What do you think he/she will offer?

- Do you think he/she will accept?

- Why or why not?

Now let us try this on veconlab, along with a simple 'Dictator' game

The prize is
----
> This program runs a two-person, bargaining game. In the Dictator version, one person simply decides unilaterally how to split a fixed amount of money. In the Ultimatum treatment, the proposer makes an offer of how to split the money, which the responder either accepts or rejects. An acceptance implements the proposed split, and a rejection results in zero earnings for both.

##Ultimatum game: theoretical predictions

Allowing 'non-credible threats', this game has as many Nash equilibria as there are possible splits of the pie

\

`r format_with_col("In each of them, the Responder's strategy is to 'accept only if offered X (or more)' for some $X\geq0$, and the Proposer's strategy is to offer exactly X.","gray")`

. . .

But maybe these equilibria don't seem like reasonable predictions (why?)

----

Q: What does SPNE predict (use backwards induction)?


- If the split is $(1,0)$, the Responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting

- That still means the Proposer offering $(1,0)$ and the Responder accepting is a NE

----

The subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is found by solving the game backwards:

- The Proposer (correctly) anticipates the Responder will accept any offer
    - Thus she offers zero, which is accepted 'in equilibrium'

- A 'near zero' offer would lead to a similar result, and might seem more intuitive

<aside class="notes">These are basic game theoretic predictions, not Behavioural.</aside>

----

###What happens in experiments?

- Class question: What do you think?


. . .


- 50-50 split is the most common offer
- Responders tend to reject offers giving them less than 30\%, even when this is a lot of money


. . .


Potential explanations

- Fairness concerns; monetary payoffs may not represent actual payoffs
- Proposers may anticipate this

<aside class="notes">We will come back to this, to discuss 'fairness preferences' and other preferences in this context</aside>

**What do you think happens when you ask people to donate either Before-conditionally or After winning a prize or bonus?**


A. Commit more before than they give after \

B. Commit less before than they give after \

C. About the same \


----


**EU over outcomes predicts these choices are the same**

\footnotesize

Here, in choosing *conditional* choices 'if I win' etc., the decision for each state (win or lose) are separate.


. . .


Max $EU = pr(win)u(win,choice if win) + pr(lose)u(lose,choice if lose)$

Choice for 'if I win' does *not* affect payoff 'if I lose'

\

. . .

Before: Anticipate what my utility-max donation $g^*$ would be if I win the bonus
    - Let $c$ be own consumption, $Y$ income pre-bonus, $w$ the bonus amount, and $g_b$ the committed donation 'if you win $w$'
    - Choose $g_b$ to maximize utility $u(c, g)$ s.t. budget constraint $c+g \leq Y+w$
    - If asked to pre-commit 'if I win', I commit to that choice, so $g_b=g^*$

\


- After: After I have won the bonus $w$, I maximize utility $u(c, g)$ s.t. budget constraint $c+g \leq Y+w$
    - Same maximisation as above, so $g_a=g_b=g^*$


----

**Other models predict distinct outcomes**

- **Reputation:** If I give to benefit my reputation or self-esteem, *unrealised* donations may matter, not just donation outcomes
    - May be an incentive to commit *more* the less likely a donation needs to be paid
    - 'If I win the lottery megabucks, I will give it all away'

----

... **Other models predict distinct outcomes**

- **Loss aversion:** If I am 'loss averse' over my own consumption, it may seem 'cheaper' to commit before I win the bonus than after
    - Why? Because my *reference point* may change.

. . .


- Suppose I've \pounds50k income and a potential \pounds50k bonus with 50\% probability
    - Before winning my reference consumption may be the EV, \pounds75k
    - So a conditional donation to donate \pounds10k if I have a total income+bonus of \pounds100k may not seem like a loss
    - But after I win the bonus, my new reference consumption may be \pounds100k
    - So each pound donated might feel like a loss

###Additional relevant questions


<br> \bigskip


**(25 marks)   Describe a typical ``public goods'' experiment, and some standard results. To what extent are these findings relevant for real world policymaking? Explain.  Please write \textit{clearly} and \underline{concisely}.**

----

*Describe a typical ``public goods'' experiment, and some standard results.*

. . .


- Significant cooperation/contributions (counter to  dominant-strategy prediction)

- Some 'selfish' players, many 'reciprocal'

- Declines with repetition but not to zero


. . .


- More cooperation when groups/players are kept constant than when meeting `strangers' each time

. . .


- Factors such as communication, higher return rates, smaller groups increase cooperation

. . .


- Allowing sanctioning can sometimes improve contributions



----

*To what extent are these findings relevant for real world policymaking?*

  Relevance to real world:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Game theory predictions for total payoffs, not just for money $\rightarrow$ social and fairness preferences hard to control
    \item NE not really a `prediction' but a description of what would be an equilibrium
    \item Limitations of lab; (scale of incentives, student participants\dots) NE still may be predictive in large real-world settings (mixed evidence on this)
    \item Still, robustness of these results suggest we should be sceptical of NE as a universal prediction
  \end{itemize}

----

Relevance for policy:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Anticipate some voluntary contributions; taxation need not always cover full costs
    \item Structure institutions and local groups to facilitate contributions (see principles above and in slides); try not to `crowd out' voluntarism
    \item People may also cooperate in undesirable ways (benefits fraud, crime, corruption)
  \end{itemize}


[comment]: <> (101EE)

----

**(25 marks) In this module we discussed \textit{four} major ways in which behavioural economists argue that people diverge from classical assumptions. Briefly explain each of these four ways, citing some evidence (academic or anecdotal) for each.**



There are four general ways people diverge from classical assumptions

**1. Limited cognitive ability $\rightarrow$ difficult and costly to make complex decisions**

It may be very costly and difficult to  do the calculations that we assume are part of standard maximization. Rather than strictly finding the optimal consumption bundles, choosing the optimal number of hours to work per day,  calculating the optimal investment portfolio, etc. people may use heuristics and 'rules of thumb'.


----

\underline{Evidence for Limited Cognitive Ability:} `r format_with_col("This is too long an answer, I'm just giving you some ideas","gray")`

Systematically incorrect answers  to simple financial literacy questions;  and responses correlate with holding an extremely high interest loans.

Many people state they have keep separate fixed budgets for different  categories of expenditure (food, vacations, charity etc).

In marketing/behavioral experiments adding more choices  has sometimes been found to reduce  purchases within a category.

Also, adding an (unchosen) 'largest size' choice  seen to increase consumption of the second largest choice (heuristic: 'choose the middle option')

See also 'taxi driver's heuristic'


<!---
Various experiments:  when people are given coupons and subsidies for one particular good,  for which they typically consume more than that amount of anyways,  this  still disproportionately increases their consumption of that item, rather than being fully fungible.  E.g., there's a paper where a 'drinks voucher' (relative to a 'food voucher')  at a restaurant leads to a greater overall consumption of beverages even for people who normally consume many beverages.
-->

----

\underline{2. Limited willpower $\rightarrow$  self control problems}

People  struggle to make choices that they know are in their best long-term interest. (Evidence: see next part)

\underline{3. Limited self interest $\rightarrow$  care about others (fairness, altruism), issues beyond income/consumption}

\textit{Evidence:}  Significant  charitable giving (1\% of UK GDP),  large part of income spent on family and gifts.  Rejection of positive offers in ultimatum game experiments  (in various lab and naturalistic contexts). Contribution to linear public goods, cooperation in  prisoners dilemmas, even in 1-shot games ...


----

\underline{4. Inconsistent, changing, and 'non-outcome-based' preferences}

\small

People seem to act to maximise targets and avoid losses relative to reference points.  For example several papers report evidence consistent with people (e.g., taxi drivers) setting 'earnings targets' and thus working \textit{fewer hours} on days when their per-hour earnings are higher (and they should know this).    It can be shown that if drivers were to  work fewer hours on 'bad'  and more hours on `good'  days they could more money working the same number of hours,  and even have less variance in a number of hours they work. This cannot be reconciled with a model maximising an unchanging utility function.



----

**(25 marks)  For \textit{TWO} of the major departures above, give a \textit{specific example} of such behaviour, and briefly describe the nature of the evidence for this, and present one behavioural economics model explaining this behaviour.**

**First departure I am discussing: 'Inconsistent, changing, and 'non-outcome-based' preferences'**


. . .

**'Specific example of behaviour'**


The Allais paradox offers evidence against Expected Utility maximisation (over outcomes) and in line with Loss Aversion and Prospect Theory.


----

 Scenario such as

- Gamble A: 89\% chance win \pounds 1 mln, 10\% chance win \pounds 5 mln, \& 1\% chance win 0.

- Gamble B: \pounds1 million with certainty.

\textit{vs.}

- Gamble C: 89\% chance of winning 0 and an 11\% chance of winning \pounds1 million

- Gamble D: a 90\% chance of win 0  and 10\% chance of winning \pounds5 million.

Consistently in hypothetical and incentivised experiments people tend to choose B over A and also choose D over C.

\textit{This contradicts Expected Utility theory}:

If $B \succ A$ then $EU(A) > EU(B)$

$\rightarrow U(1m) > 0.89 \: U(1m) + 0.1 \: U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0)$

$\rightarrow$ $0.11 \: U(1m) >  0.1 U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0)$

\medskip


. . .


However,  if $D \succ C$ then $EU(D)>EU(C)$

$\rightarrow 0.9 \: U(0) + 0.1 U(5m) > 0.89 \: U(0) + 0.11 \: U(1m)$

Implying $0.1 \: U(5m) + 0.01 \: U(0) > 0.11 \: U(1m)$

Contradicting the above!

**'Describe the nature of evidence for this'**

\underline{Evidence:}  In hypothetical experiments by Kahneman and Tversky, as well in experiments with real incentives (e.g., Huck and Muller),  people tend to choose B over A, and also to choose D over C. (Sometimes the same people  will make  of these apparently inconsistent choices but in general  the differences in proportions are large enough that we can show the general pattern even if we're only asking people to make a single choice.)

**'...and present one behavioural economics model'**

\textit{Why do many people choose B over A and D over C?}

<br> \bigskip

\underline{One theory: Loss aversion/Prospect theory}

\footnotesize

Theory: People evaluate outcomes relative to \textit{reference points}. Falling below these reference points is particular costly to utility; the usual specification models utility as the  some of a  standard risk-averse utility function and a ' gain-loss' utility function. The latter is negative where some outcome (e.g., earnings) falls below a reference point; it's slope is assumed to be greatest for 'small losses' and then more gradual for larger losses. In net this can make people risk seekers over a range of losses, willing to increase the risk of a large loss to reduce the risk of a small loss. The reference points themselves may change depending on the framing of the decision, on previous expectation, on unrealised states, and in general on things that are not relevant to future material outcomes of the decision.

\textit{Applying this to the example above ... (Allais Paradox)}

- Considering A \& B, the ref. point may be close to \pounds1000, as this can be had with certainty.

    -  A seems to 'risk a costly loss of \pounds1000', thus may choose 'safer' $B>A$, notwithstanding its far lower EV (\pounds1000 vs \pounds1390)


. . .

- Considering D \& C, ref. point may be close to 0, as EV's of each are low, \& 0 is likeliest outcome

    - So 'don't worry about losses', choose D over C because  higher EV (\pounds500 vs. \pounds110)

*By the way, here are some more behavioural econ problems to practice ... from Nicholson and Snyder chapter 17 (12th ed, 11th similar)*

- 17.2: this will be especially helpful for understanding the EU basis of the Allais Paradox

- 17.3


- (17.5)

- 17.7: pretty good setup for time inconsistent behaviour

- (17.8) - also a good setup for time inconsistency, has video solution on CourseMate

- 17.9 - decent for understanding loss aversion. Should say 'would his choice change *if* his reference point' ('if' is missing)
