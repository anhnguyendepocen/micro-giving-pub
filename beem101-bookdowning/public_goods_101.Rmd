*Key goals of this chunk*

1. Learn how economists define a public good
- Be able to assess whether something fits into this category
1. Understand what 'market failures are'
1. Learn and be able to explain why a competitive market will usually *undersupply* a public good (but may still supply *some* of it)
1. Understand the difficulties *government* may face in providing the right amount of a public good
1. Get a sense of the general patterns and evidence on *voluntary* provision of public goods, including in 'lab experiments'
- and what 'lab experiments' in economics are



<br> <br> \bigskip

Outline: What is a public good, why do markets fail to provide these optimally, (how) can governments provide these optimally, when do people provide these voluntarily?

<br> <br> \bigskip


**Motivation**

- Policy: The 'public goods argument' is critical to justify many government programmes (military, environmental cleanup, research, etc)
- Management: Firms/workers can only profit from providing a public good through getting subsidies or by turning it into a private good.

\

## Market failures

- Occur when prices don't fully reflect the marginal social benefits or costs
    - Provide scope for political intervention
    - How does this happen?
    - One potential source of market failure: Public Goods

## Public Goods (attributes, categories)

What are the characteristics of a public good?


*Def* -- A **Pure Public Good** is a good that is both

<br> <br> \bigskip

1. *Non-excludable*: Once the good is provided, it is impossible/costly to prevent any individual from using/benefiting from it.


*Note:* This even includes individuals who have not paid for it

<br> <br> \bigskip

Opposite (and alt definition)
*Exclusive goods*: ... a good is exclusive if it is relatively easy to bar people from benefitting from it once it has been produced


<br> <br> \bigskip

2. *Non-rival:* One person's consumption doesn’t reduce the quantity available for others.

- The fact that some people use the good doesn’t prevent others from using the *same* good.


- There is no “crowding.”

Alt (equivalent def):

- Providable to additional users at zero marginal (social) cost.

-  Consumption of additional units of the good involves zero marginal social cost of production. (E.g., if we had produced a film but restricted it to subscribers, the marginal social cost of letting the whole world download it is essentially zero; the exclusion would take us away from the 'utility frontier')




Q: think of some examples.


```{block2,  type='note'}

In market economies, private suppliers provide the majority of goods and services to consumers. However, certain goods are publicly provided. These include for example defense, education, and health. Why does the government instead of the market provide these goods?  Which characteristics differentiate goods that are privately provided from goods that are publicly provided? How do we define public goods?

The terminology might induce the conclusion that 'public goods are good that are publicly provided as opposed to private goods which are privately provided.' This conclusion is simply WRONG! The public or private nature of the good is an intrinsic characteristic of goods that is not related to the provider of the good
Hence, it may well be that the state provides a private good or that the market provides a public good.

### Examples, In-between's {-}


Excludable and rival (depleatable)? $\rightarrow$ *Private good*

<br> <br> \bigskip

\

*“Club goods”:* excludable but non-rivalrous (at least up to a congestion point).

\

<br> <br> \bigskip

*"Common property"*: Nonexcludable but rivalrous


<br> <br> \bigskip

“Somewhat” nonexcludable and/or “somewhat” nonrival:  $\rightarrow$  “impure public goods.”

- The 2012 Olympics in London

\

## Why do public goods lead to market failure?

### The basic idea {-}

If a good is *non-rival* then additional provision is costless.
Thus,

- if exclusion is possible, and *any* positive price is charged, some are deterred from consuming it
- this is inefficient: people who could benefit from the good, at no cost to others, will not consume it :(

Even if each person provided it for their *own* benefit (on the assumption that no one else would), they would typically choose *too little* from a social POV...

They would make this choice considering their own marginal benefits (and MRS) versus the price or cost, not the *social* marginal benefit (as the latter is a positive *externality*, not part of what they maximise)
\

If a good is *non-excludable* it will be difficult to charge people for it

Many might prefer to wait for *others* to buy it, and then they enjoy it anyways (free-ride), which could lead to coordination problems.

But if firms cannot charge for its full value, they might not pay the costs to develop/build/provide it.

- Who would pay to produce a film that is freely pirated/distributed?

- Who would pay to develop a drug that must be priced at its marginal cost?

- Why contribute to police protection for your village, if your neighbours will pay for it anyways?



```{block2,  type='note'}
Loosely, 'rivalryness' basically relates to whether market provision will be *efficient*; 'excludability' tells you whether firms can make *some revenue* from providing it, selling the same produced good to more than one person (or to a 'club' of people)
```

\

### The role of price signals in 'public goods $\rightarrow$ market failure' {-}


The First Welfare Theorem's assumptions/conditions do not apply to public goods. Markets do not yield a Pareto Optimal outcome.

\

Essentially this follows because the market will not produce where the consumers' MRS equals the rate at which public and private goods 'trade off in production'.  More of the public good could be produced by sacrificing some of the private good, and consumers will be better off.
\

- Non-excludability $\rightarrow$  no price or suboptimal price $\rightarrow$ firms don't get the correct signals for production

- Non-rivalry $\rightarrow$ each unit provides benefit to all, consumer choices don't reflect this

\


## Social benefit of a private good vs a public good {-}

- Overall value of a private good: (area under the) "horizontal sum" of individual marginal benefit curves

- For public goods the aggregate value "sums vertically"

- Social margin benefit of PG sums *vertically*

\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","pgprovision1.png"))
```


*Note:* Even at p=mc, neither consumer will pay for it alone.  Neither flatmate will pay £80 to have the house cleaned, even though it is worth £60 to each flatmate.
\

```{block2,  type='warning'}
*Note :* To avoid confusion, note that we are talking about marginal cost as the cost of providing a unit of the public good 'to everyone' \
E.g., one new movie produced, or one firework displayed to the whole city.
Once produced, all benefit, i.e., the cost of letting additional people enjoy it is *zero*.
```


```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics(file.path("picsfigs","pgprovision2.png"))
```

`r format_with_col("Q: What happens here?","blue")`
\
Ans: The individual with the higher valuation purchases q of this public good if it is priced at marginal cost. \

However, he will still purchase less than the *socially optimal* amount, $Q^*$

\


With a binary choice (provide or don't) it is a Prisoner's Dilemma:

<!-- Algebraic example of PG underprovision here? -->


## Application: drug development {-}

*Drug R\&D may be a public good, or a common resource*

- Expensive to develop and introduce a new drug -- 'sunk costs' once developed
- But cheap to copy and produce; without patent protection may have $P=mc$ and no ex-post profit to compensate for sunk costs
    - $\rightarrow$ No incentive to develop drugs without patent protection guaranteeing 'excludability' and a limited monopoly
- But ex-post, patent protection is costly; drug produced for a few pennies sold for £1000's
    - People may not buy, or NHS may not cover
    - $\rightarrow$ Inefficient: some consumers may value drug at £100's, far above MC, yet they don't consume it
- Possible solution: Government *awards* and subsidies for drug development.




## Optimal provision of public goods, equilibrium provision

Here I present a more formal depiction of this problem.

### Simple statement

We first normalize utility (monotonic transformation) s.t. each £
spent (or £ of cost incurred) on the private good (X) yields "1 util", and let the price (and constant marginal cost) of this good be £1. (Challenge question: when is is reasonable to do this, and why?)^[When the MRS between the other goods is the same for any level of one 'numeraire' good, i.e., where utility is quasilinear, we can do this. With only 2 goods this is not an issue. Also, this normalization doesn't preserve calculations over the 'absolute amount of utility', but this doesn't matter. However, this could be problematic if we are moving away from ordinal utility to try instead compare gains/losses among people with unequal endowments.] Furthermore, for simplicity (wlog), let the marginal benefit of the public good not depend on the amount of the private good, i.e., a quasilinear utility function for everyone, and again wlog, the same utility function  for everyone:

$$u_i(x,G)= x + u(G)$$, where $G=\sum_{i=1}^{N}g_i$ is the *total* amount of the public good provided.

\


Given diminishing MRS $\rightarrow$ we have the unique optimum provision of any PG:

Optimum provision $G^\ast$ units of the public good must satisfy (at $G=G^\ast$)


$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\partial u_i(x_i,G)}{\partial G}/MC(G) = \frac{\partial u_i(x_i,G)}{\partial x_i}/MC(x)$$
... intuitively, the 'bang for the buck' must be equal (at least if the problem is symmetric). If net utility can be gained by adding  a unit of resource towards the production of  one good and taking it away from the other, we cannot be at an optimum point.
\

Note that an additional unit of the public good yields value to *all* individuals (hence the sum term), while an additional unit of the private good only benefits one person.

\
Given our normalisation that each unit of the private good yields one unit of utility  $\frac{\partial u_i(x_i,G)}{\partial x_i}/mc_x=1$ and the utility is quasilinear and the same for everyone this simplifies to


$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\partial u(G)}{\partial G}/MC(G) = 1$$

In other words, if we consider the 'marginal benefit' for individual i $MB_i(G)=\frac{\partial u(G)}{\partial G}$ we get:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} MB_i(G) = MC(G)$$

\

`r format_with_col("(given the allocation of private consumption)","gray")`

\

... with $G^\ast$  units of PG, *social* MB (sum individual marginal benefits) of the public good must equal the marginal cost of providing it (the opportunity cost in terms of the private good.)

\

Note that here MC(G) essentially expresses the MRT and MB_i is essentially i's MRS, as the private good yields a constant marginal utility.


\

**Now consider individuals' contributions without intervention**

Denote each individual i's contribution to/purchase of the public good as $g_i$, again, the total contribution is $$G \equiv\sum_{i=1}^{N}g_i$$, and the sum of 'contributions by individuals other than i as $g_{-i}\equiv G-g_i$.

Consider individuals  ($i=i..N$) who privately best-respond to each  others' choices; an 'equilibrium'. Consider an interior solution where everyone provides a positive amount of the public good. Here (incorporating the normalisation)... they will choose to provide amounts of the public good $g_i$ such that,

\

*given the total amount provided (by themself and others), their PRIVATE marginal benefit of an additional unit of the good provided equals the cost, i.e., the amount of the private good they must give up:*

$$\frac{\partial u_i(g_i+g_{-i})}{\partial g_i}\equiv MB_i(g_i+g_{-i})\equiv MB_i(G)=mc(G)$$
... the old 'bang for the buck' ... but here it's the 'private bang'.
\

Clearly this is *not* compatible with the condition for  Pareto-optimal provision if we have more than one person (i.e., if $N>1$) who benefits from the public good (in the relevant range):

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} MB_i(G) = MC(G)$$


\

Stated slightly differently we have have the **"Samuelson condition"** for optimal provision


$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} MRS_i(G,X) = MRT(G,X)$$

\

For the efficient mix of public and private goods (top-level efficiency)... the *sum* of each individual's MRS's must equal the economy's MRT.

\

Compare this to the private good case, where top-level efficiency required that for each individual $i$ the $MRS_i=MRT$.



```{block2,  type='technote'}
This can be derived by solving the  "Pareto problem":

maximise 1 person's utility

subject to holding all others' utility at or above a threshold

and s.t. the "aggregate production constraint"

See [Durham lecture 12](http://community.dur.ac.uk/t.i.renstrom/teaching/PUBECON/Lect_12.pdf) for a 2-household case deriving this.

```

### Practice question

Consider an economy with N individuals each with income m which they can use for own consumption c at “numeraire” price 1 (representing the cost of production), or contribute to a public good.

\

Suppose each individual’s utility is:

$U_i(c,G)= c + ln(G)$

\

1. What is the optimal total provision of this public good?
\

2. What will be the total private voluntary provision? Does it matter if we consider only 'symmetric' equilibria or if we allow asymmetric provision (some provided more than others)
\

3. Show/argue that an omniscient and powerful government could ensure an outcome that is a Pareto-improvement over the symmetric private outcome?


\

4. Now let $U_i = c+0.9*(G)$; answer the above questions for this case.

\

## Solutions to the Public Goods Problem

(you can skip the Lindahl equilibrium discussion)


## Food for thought, discussion

1. What is a public good? What do we call a good with only 1 of these 2 necessary properties?

2. Why does the free market *underprovide* these? Why/when do they provide some amount?



1. What is an example of a public good, perhaps one from your own life that we didn't already mention


2. What are some things you think may lead to more *voluntary* provision of public goods?




Pure public goods are not provided optimally by the free market, i.e., voluntarily^[Except in really special and lucky cases] (although people do contribute to public goods, e.g., making charitable donations, for various reasons).

This is a justification for government: to enforce contributions to public goods, and make everyone better off... (or, allowing heterogeneous tastes, achieve a “potential Pareto improvement”; those who benefit could compensate those who are harmed and still all would be better off)

**But** it's hard to determine tastes for the public good, hence difficult to determine the optimal level!

\

### Revealing the Demand for Public Goods (brief)

Suppose some people like fireworks, and some don't. How many should the town pay for? Let's consider some 'mechanisms' for figuring this out.

i. Ask everyone to state the number of fireworks they want, and we choose the average and split costs evenly?


`r format_with_col("Q: would this work?","blue")`
\

- $\rightarrow$ Fireworks-lovers may overstate their value to skew the average.


ii. Ask everyone to state number they want; choose average; those who stated more pay more?

- $\rightarrow$ Many people understate their value to avoid having to pay. Doh!

<br> <br> \bigskip

*It is difficult or impossible to find a 'mechanism' that leads to 'truth-telling'.*

```{block2,  type='technote'}

In a general sense it is impossible to find/'implement' an incentive-compatible truth-telling mechanism...

- Where everyone states some amount
- Everyone pays some amount as a function of the amount they stated (and the amounts others stated
- And some level of public good/outcome is provided as a function of these statements

  \

... that leads to truthful revelation and the optimal provision of the public good...

\

UNLESS we are willing to commit to 'throw away value' in some states of the world

OR we have an external entity that can inject and/or extract value in some states of the world.

\
We say there is no 'first-best implementable balanced budget mechanism'.

```


- Direct voting on each proposal also may not lead to the optimal choice

\

### Voting paradox example {-}

Green party: Green Park $\succ$ Public housing $\succ$ Private housing \

Labour: Public housing $\succ$ Private Housing $\succ$ Green Park \

Conservatives: Private Housing $\succ$ Green Park $\succ$ Public housing \


<br> <br> \bigskip

Suppose we have a local council with one member of each party (representing equal-sized constituencies).

<br> <br> \bigskip

Which proposal would win if they voted on:
- a Green park versus Public housing?
- a Green Park versus Private housing?
- Private housing versus Public housing?


<br> <br> \bigskip

*Does a majority vote reveal a clear 'social preference'?*

No, not here.

\

## Lab evidence on *voluntary* provision of Public Goods

 Typical “Public Goods Experiment”

- Four undergraduates  seated at a table. Each given an 'endowment' of \$5.
- Told that each can choose to invest some or all of it in a 'group project.'

\
<br> <br> \bigskip

- Each simultaneously puts an amount between \$0 and \$5 in envelope. (Or via computer terminals).

- Experimenter collects the “contributions” and doubles the total, divides this equally among the group.

- The private benefit from this “public good” = one half of total contributions.
    - (But I only get back *half* of my own contribution)

\

**Basic results**

- On average, subjects contribute halfway between everything and nothing
- Contributions decline with repetition, but not to zero
- Face to face communication improves the rate of contribution


```{block2,  type='note'}
Advanced discusssion... More recent evidence finds that this decline seems to be related to issues of reciprocity, fairness and conditional cooperation. \
When conditional cooperators are separated (or can self segregate) a higher level of cooperation is maintained.
```

\

Remember: we are not covering the 'externalities' section in NS or other texts, although there is a great deal of overlap and no clear distinction between public goods and externalities. A global public good (bad) is similar to a global i.e., nondepletable positive (negative) externality.
