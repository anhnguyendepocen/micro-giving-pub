## First problem set: Mathematical approaches, economic models, revision and warm-up {-#ps1}

`r format_with_col("We will cover key parts of this problem set in the first tutorial (as well as part of the second problem set). However, you should aim to be able to do and understand all of the material on the assigned problem sets.","Grey")`


*Goals of this problem set:*


- Re-acquaintance  with mathematical approaches to Economics (e.g., simultaneous equations, graphing functions)
- Revising the supply and demand model and its implications, applying this to real-world problems, considering *empirical* approaches

- Understanding the logic of 'difficult' multiple choice questions (*assessment* tips)

- Discussing and writing a coherent response to applied Economics questions


### Problem 1: simple demand and supply curves, computation, inference {-}


![](picsfigs/ns_prob1.png)

**Express the algebraic equation for  these lines.

<!--


*Now to figure out the algebraic equation...*

- (Recall GCSE maths formula for straight line: $y=mx+b$)

- This is a linear function $P = a+bQ$ (when we get to demand, we allow $b$ to be negative)

*Essentially repeating the above 'rise over run' calculation'...*

- For supply, increase P by 1 and Q increases by 200. (See diagram)
    - i.e, for $\Delta P = 1$, $\Delta Q = 200$
    - ... implying that if price were to increase by 1, firms would be willing to provide 200 more units in total

\textcolor{gray}{Doing this more carefully ... if we have any two points, $x_1,y_1$ and $x_2,y_2$ we can compute the slope $m= \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$, again 'rise over run'.}

\textcolor{gray}{Take any two points on the supply curve (the table above), and compute this to get the slope.}

\textcolor{gray}{E.g., $(P_1,Q_1)$ = $(1,100)$ and $(P_2,Q_2)$=$(2,300)$.  The slope is thus $\frac{(300-100)}{(2-1)}=200.$ as stated above. However, this is the slope of $Q$ in $P$. Confusingly, although economists usually consider how $Q$ changes in $P$ along supply (or demand curves), our convention is to plot $P$ on the vertical axis an $Q$ on the horizontal. So, when drawing the slope, remember to keep this straight. If the slope of Q in P is 200, the slope of P in Q is actually the inverse of this, namely $1/200$. (Check: $\frac{P_2-P_1}/{Q2-Q1}=1/200$). Also note that a slope of $1/200$ would look almost flat, so it's better to make the quantity axis in units of 100, so you can do a slope of 1/2 (vertical increase of 1 units for each 2 units of horizontal increase).}

- Thus $\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q} = \frac{1}{200}$
    - We know the slope $b=\frac{1}{200}$
    - $\rightarrow P = a + \frac{q}{200}$

*What about the intercept $a$?*
Just plug some value into the formula and solve for this.
    - at $P=2$, $Q=300$
    - $\rightarrow 2 = a + \frac{300}{200} = a + \frac{3}{2}$
    - so $a = \frac{1}{2}$
- Thus the equation is $P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{Q_s}{200}$
- or $Q_s=200P-100$

\footnote{Check: does this equation describe the graph? Is it intuitive? Supply upward-sloping in price. Intercept: $P>1/2$ necessary for a positive quantity supplied.}

\

For demand, increase P by 1 and Q declines by 100.

- Solves similarly to above:
    - $\rightarrow$ $P=8-\frac{Q_d}{100}$ or $Q_d=800-100p$

**1.1.C: Use your solutions from part b to calculate the "excess demand" for orange juice if the (imposed) market price is zero**

- Note that for the supply curve, quantity supplied is never negative -- below a certain price, it will just be zero.
    - Consider: (why) does this make sense?

*More technically, firms choose among their feasible 'production sets', which must be non-negative.

<!--
[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

**Ans:**

- Draw these functions on the same graph to aid intuition

- $Q_d(P)=800-100P$ $\rightarrow$ $Q_d(0)=800$
- $\rightarrow$ Excess demand at $P = 0$ is $Q_d(0)-Q_s(0)=800-0 = 800$.

*Consider: does this make sense? If the government declared 'orange juice must be free' and imposed no subsidies, would you expect there to be excess demand?*

### MCQs from previous exams, slightly adjusted  {-}

\

**MCQ2 True or False: One example of microdata is a set of over 5 million observations of income, hours worked, and demographic information from over 1 million households' tax returns over five years.**

<br> \bigskip

<!--
[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

**Answer:**

True. Microdata refers to the level of the unit of observation; the economic decision-maker, such as an individual or household, rather than an aggregation, such as an entire country or market. 65\% got this one right.

\textcolor{gray}{Note – this was covered in the mini-lecture ‘Empirical microeconomics/econometrics’ as well as in the text. Again, this is a ‘challenge question’; if you read carefully, and read the suggested applications and additional readings, you should be able to get most of these questions. However, I don’t expect everyone will get these right, so I will limit the number of such questions so that you can still get a good mark without knowing these.
I want you to have more than just a ‘textbook theoretical’ understanding. Understanding how data is used in business, economic analysis, and policy, will be very important in your career!}

**MCQ3  True or false: It is valid to plot observed prices and quantities traded in a market and fit a line through them to estimate a market demand curve.**

<!--
[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

**Answer:**
False.  "If we plot prices and quantities traded in a market, we are be observing the interaction of shifts in supply and demand curve, so it is difficult to estimate either curve without further assumptions. About 30\% got this one right.

**MCQ5: True or false: If people who attended university earn more than those who did not, this proves that university makes people more productive. **

(Extension: What conditions would be necessary to obtain credible evidence on this question?)

<!--

[comment]: <> (ANSBB)

**Answer:**

False. Those who attended university may have had a greater potential to earn money whether or not they *actually* attended university. They may have been more skilled, hardworking, etc.

If we had a clean experiment randomly assigning people to university we might be able to credibly assert that attending university did *cause* later outcomes, and perhaps caused these people to earn more money. However, we still would not that this occurred through the *channel* of making people more productive. There are other reasons why completing university may increase income other than 'making people more productive'.

### Consider the following utility function (direct maximisation) {-}

```{block2,  type='note'}
Note, these examples are taken from the "theory of consumer choice" section in the Autor notes. But try it on your own first.
```  

$$U(x,y) = \frac{1}{4} ln x + \frac{3}{4} ln y$$ where 'ln' denotes the natural log.

A. Show that this utility function satisfies 'global nonsatiation'

\

B. Compute the marginal rate of substitution for this utility function. Does it exhibit 'a 'diminishing marginal rate of substitution'?

\

C. Suppose an individual had the above utility function, and prices and income were:

$p_x=1, p_y=2, I=12$.

- Solve for the individual's choice of each good here

- How much additional utility, at the margin would be provided by an additional \$1 of income. Is this a meaningful concept?

```{block2,  type='tip'}
Here you can do this either with the Lagrangian method or by plugging the constraints into the optimising equation, leaving income $I$ as an argument. 
```  

### Indirect utility function  example {-}

Suppose $$U(x,y) = x^{\frac{1}{2}}y^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ (Cobb-Douglas with CRS and symmetry between the two goods).

Derive the optimal consumption (the individual demand functions) for x and y as a function of income $I$ and prices $p_x$ and $p_y$.

\

What  'share of expenditure' goes to each good?  Weird, huh?

\

Now plug these functional forms  into the original utility function to derive the 'Indirect utility function' as a function of income and prices. What is the interpretation of this function, which we will denote $V(p_x,p_y,I)$?  

### Roy's identity example {-}

Now take the partial derivative of the above indirect utility function $V(p_x,p_y,I)$ with respect to the price of x $p_x$. What is the interpretation of this?

\


Now take the partial derivative of the above indirect utility function $V(p_x,p_y,I)$ with respect to income $I$. What is the interpretation of this?

\ 

Now take the negative of the ratio of the above partial derivatives: 

$$-\frac{\partial V/\partial p_x}{\partial V/\partial I}$$

\

Check: this should yield the (Marshallian demand) for good $x$, $d_x(p_x,p_y,I)$. 

This holds in general: $$-\frac{\partial V/\partial p_x}{\partial V/\partial I}= d_x(p_x,p_y,I)$$


It's called 'Roy's identity'. Weird, huh? Do you have any intuition for this? 

\

### Purposes of economic models, readings {-}

*This question comes from the 2018 midterm*

What are the purposes and uses of 'economic models'? Should the assumptions be `realistic'? How can these models be tested and assessed? Discuss this with reference to issues discussed in Friedman's 'The methodology of positive economics,' Sugden's (2002) 'Credible worlds: the status of theoretical models in economics' and or Sitzia and Sugden's (2011)  'Implementing theoretical models in the laboratory, and what this can and cannot achieve.' In your discussion, try to refer to specific economic models (such as Akerlof's 'Market for Lemons').
