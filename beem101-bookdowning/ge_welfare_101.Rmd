# Key principles for efficiency and 'general' equilibrium

## General equilibrium and efficiency: Coverage

- This is a very brief excerpt and summary of the material in NS chapter 10, with some additional motivation
- If you understand these slides/notes you don't have to read chapter 10


## Introduction: General equilibrium

We can show that *under certain conditions* competitive markets will be efficient in equilibrium.

However:

- Some markets may not reach equilibrium 'quickly'
- These conditions may not hold $\rightarrow$ *market failure*

- Efficiency itself does not imply preferred outcomes: there can be a great deal of inequality

\

*General Equilibrium* analysis considers the entire economy as a system of markets which may interact with one another

- General equilibrium: a set of prices so that $Q_s(P)=Q_d(P)$ in all markets, including input markets
- Markets are interdependent
    - E.g., a government push for tomato consumption may shift tomato demand out and prices up
    - this may lead in the LR, to a shift out in tomato supply curves (firms enter)
    - this may increase the demand for *inputs* such as farm labour, raising the cost of production of other vegetables
    - etc.
- Will we return to equilibrium, and with what prices and quantities?
- Stay tuned true believers! (and take more Econ, because we won't cover it here)

When reading papers, you may hear of  'partial equilibrium' vs. 'general equilibrium analyses.'

Varian, 1992:

> The single-market story ...is a partial equilibrium model in that all prices other than the price of the good being studied are assumed to remain fixed. In the general equilibrium model all prices are variable, and equilibrium requires that all markets clear. Thus, general equilibrium theory takes account of all of the interactions between markets, as well as the functioning of the individual markets.

## Pareto efficiency

```{block2,  type='technote'}
**Walrasian General equilibrium; a more formal definition (peek)**

(But for an exchange economy only)

```


Overall Pareto efficiency: no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off

- If we *could* do so, we would not be at an efficient point

Pareto efficiency is hard to disagree with, as a policy goal; \
if we could move to a situation where some were better off and none made worse off, we should do it.

## The three amigos of efficiency: productive, exchange, and top-level

Overall efficiency requires several conditions: Productive, Exchange, and Top-level efficiency


Efficiency in production (being on the PPF)
:     No way to reallocate inputs to increase production of one good without reducing production of another


<br> <br> \bigskip

<center> Given society's resources, we are producing 'as much as possible' </center>


\

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/hightower_cartoon1.png")
```

Efficiency in production?



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='70%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/self-checkout.jpg")
```



```{block2,  type='note'}

Note: Basic argument for productive efficiency of competitive equilibrium:
Firms hire more of each input until its 'bang for buck' is the same as all other inputs,
and a single market price for the input will ensure this is the same across firms.
This 'equilibrium' input price must reflect its marginal productivity
in producing the 'last unit' for each and every firm.
```
\



Efficiency in consumption (exchange efficiency)
:     No way to reallocate output amongst consumers to make them all better off


<br> <br> \bigskip


<br> <br> \bigskip

<center>

Given what we're producing, it is going to the 'right consumers'.

</center>

*Note--* Basic argument for productive efficiency of competitive equilibrium:
If, given the 'endowments', one person values A in units B more than someone else,
an equilibrium price ensures that they will trade these amongst one another until each has the same MRS

The 'Edgeworth box' offers a graphical demonstration that this yields a Pareto optimum (given the amounts produced).

```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

An equilibrium price ensures that they will trade these amongst one another until each has the same MRS.

The 'Edgeworth box' offers a graphical demonstration that this yields a Pareto optimum (given the amounts produced).

```{block2,  type='note'}

***Conditions and argument for efficiency in consumption (Exchange efficiency)***


With DMRS, this is equivalent to 'for the last (positive) unit of X purchased by each consumer, they are all willing to give up the same amount of X to get another Y'




I.e., their marginal rates of substitution for the last unit they buy are all the same: equal to the price ratio.




$\leftarrow$ basically ensured by the $MRS(x,y)=p_x/p_y$ 'bang for the buck' condition.

All purchase a good up to the point in which their willingness to trade it off for another good equals the price ratio; thus all have the same relative valuation (MRS) for the 'last unit' of each good.

The Edgeworth box shows how this could occur more directly through exchange.
the price that leads one guy to want to 'sell A units of X and buy B units of Y',
 and also leads the other guy to want to 'buy A units of X and sell B units of X'
 leads them to both have the same MRS at this 'equilibrium bundle.

```

Given our inputs, we can produce 'efficiently', i.e, along the PPF,


and given the amounts of each good produced, it is 'consumed by the right people' (no more room for trade) ...



yet we may still not be at efficiency? `r format_with_col("Why?","blue")`



```{r  fig.cap = '', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("picsfigs/toplevelefficiency.png")
```



We need to produce the right *combination* of goods.

<br> <br> \bigskip
Efficient allocation of resources ('top-level' condition)
:     No way to produce more of one good and less of another to make all consumers better off


## A basic argument for exchange efficiency of competitive equilibrium:


Basic argument for top-level efficiency of competitive equilibrium:

Equilibrium prices from exchange reflect each consumer's marginal rates of substitution for their  last unit

This signals to firms the rate at which *all* consumers would be willing to trade off A for B at the margin

In equilibrium firms produce at a point where the cost tradeoffs between A and B (slope of PPF) reflects these prices.

## Fundamental theorems of welfare economics; market failures

<!--
Todo: give more explanation here
-->

First fundamental theorem of welfare economics
:     A general competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient, under standard assumptions.

Loose intuition: free exchange leaves no room for mutually-beneficial improvements, and firms and consumers optimise


\

Second fundamental theorem
:     Under some fancy assumptions, any Pareto efficient outcome is a competitive equilibrium for some pattern of initial endowments

- So if we could costlessly redistribute *endowments*, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome by doing so, and then relying on the free market.

<br> <br> \bigskip

**But these assumptions may not hold, this there may be 'market failures'**

1. Imperfect Competition

Markets may not be competitive, because of barriers to entry or increasing returns to scale

$\rightarrow$ Prices may not reflect marginal costs, leading to 'deadweight losses'


<br> <br> \bigskip

2. Externalities, public goods, altruism

The assumptions require 'anything someone values' is bought and sold in the market on their own behalf.
But:

- Externalities: All costs (and benefits) may not be priced; e.g., pollution

- Public goods (and bads): Many people may benefit from the same good (e.g., fireworks)

- Altruism/interdependent utilities: People may care about *others'* consumption


<br> <br> \bigskip

3. Asymmetric information: People may have different information about the state of the world (costs, risks, a good's quality)

4. Bounded rationality: people may not choose in their own best interests


# Notes on supplementary reading

*2019: this is not neccesary the midterm, but could be relevant to the final*

## Supplementary reading:

- Slonim, Robert, Carmen Wang, and Ellen Garbarino. "The market for blood." The Journal of Economic Perspectives 28.2 (2014): 177-196.

----

## Key points:

An unusual 'market' (or non-market)

- Altruism, repugnance, asymmetric information about disease

- Limited storage of blood

. . .


- Many countries have *volunteer* supply, so no 'price' to donate
    - Volunteer behavior responds to entirely different motivations! Not guided by demand.
- $\rightarrow$  How efficient can it be?


----

>  imbalances between aggregate supply and demand are a major challenge in blood markets, including excess supply after disasters and insufficient supply at other times.

. . .


> not unexpected given that the blood market operates without market prices and with limited storage length (about six weeks) for whole blood.


. . .


> Yet shifting to a system of paying blood donors seems a practical impossibility given attitudes toward paying blood donors and concerns that a paid system could compromise blood safety.

----

- Large variation in systems across countries (volunteer versus paid and family/friend donors)

. . .

- Historical shifts:
    - Paid 'blood on the hoof', markets needed immediate matching
    - Better storage, blood banking, impersonal diffuse markets
    - WWII: Patriotism, voluntary donations
    - AIDS crisis

----

Issues with paying donors

- Does it crowd out intrinsic motivation?

. . .

- Does it bring moral hazard and 'select' the wrong, unsafe donors?


. . .

- Is it harmful to the donors (paternalistic idea)

- or otherwise 'repugnant'?


----

Issues with volunteer supply

- Not adequate in many countries


. . .

- Responds to other motivations than actual need, as there is no price

    - Donate more after disasters like 9-11 even where need is *not* high

    - But agencies don't want to turn away donors ('ungrateful', signal 'never need blood')


----

###Suggestions for improvements to blood market

- Techniques for boosting donations


    - Mandate choice

    - Symbolic and reputational rewards, gift exchange


. . .


- Clearinghouse, donor registry, invitations





----
\

**Second Welfare theorem** implied that if we could costlessly redistribute *endowments*, we could attain any socially-desirable outcome by doing so, and then relying on the free market.

- But redistribution via 'optimal lump-sum' taxes is not so easy, as endowments may be unobservable

- And redistribution based on things you can affect, e.g. income, may distort incentives.
